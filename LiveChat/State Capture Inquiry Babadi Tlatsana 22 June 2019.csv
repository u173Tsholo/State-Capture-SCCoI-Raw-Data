1561191126708009,1:04:07,Magda Seguin,"As it turns out,Van Wyk was suspended for fraud and bribery in 2016"
1561191132899124,1:04:13,Born free,All she had to do was obtain the Invoices from the contracting companies

1561191417646135,1:08:58,Born free,The commission will call these people to the enquiry and any paper evidence must be submitted.

1561191588668079,1:11:49,Magda Seguin,This evidence leader always had a hostile way of questioning throughout the commission
1561191604243893,1:12:05,Vish Govender,It appears that she did do something to gather evidence to show wrong doing. Maybe we should not judge her until all the evidence is presented including the recordings of conversations.
1561191617950483,1:12:18,cassim suleman,govt is run majority ..so looters will be part of majority.
1561191663549461,1:13:04,Magda Seguin,"Van Wyk opend the Standard Bank account and controlled it,she had no access"

1561191812349661,1:15:33,Born free,The majority are the looters.
1561191838429461,1:15:59,cassim suleman,eish get real...stop looking with blinkers...its not a rascist thing.
1561191864377987,1:16:25,Magda Seguin,There is an article called 'A masterclass in looting' implicating Van Wyk in state capture
1561191904136118,1:17:04,cassim suleman,truth hurts isnt
1561191934383383,1:17:34,Margareth Waterboer,"@Thando Nkutha, that's absolutely true. I thought so too until the security person clarified it.. I'm curious to know why he adopted that name.."

1561192078850875,1:19:59,Magda Seguin,*rands
1561192085581508,1:20:06,Margareth Waterboer,"This witness is complete puzzle..she leaves more questions... Is she part of the scheme, is she naive, is she trying to save herself, is she stupid? I'm confused.."
1561192093122625,1:20:13,Dabble Smith,"We are all born here, we need to make a better country for all."

1561192318000846,1:23:58,Magda Seguin,"@Dabble Smith the racism is off the charts,it is driven by populist rhetoric in the ANC and EFF,hopefully the BLF will disappear forever"
1561192420745162,1:25:41,Dabble Smith,"@ Thando, its because we have too much racism and it causes many problems for our country."
1561192435853113,1:25:56,Dabble Smith,We need to work together.
1561192443815961,1:26:04,TV Gee,Spiritual what?

1561192655844890,1:29:36,Dabble Smith,"It's a delicate topic, he is only giving this deep thought, no quick answers are needed."
1561192657155199,1:29:37,Anne M.,@donovan daniels Are you being sarcastic or do you genuinely believe Judge Zondo is a bit slow?
1561192678757607,1:29:59,Magda Seguin,"this is after she went to the bank to have control,he previously managed the account"
1561192685678802,1:30:06,Margareth Waterboer,I think the chair is not fooled and deliberately poses questions that seem innocent..
1561192695072289,1:30:16,Dabble Smith,Exactly
1561192744125127,1:31:04,Sabelo Zulu,Donovan I believe he's not slow but ensures there's evidence to back every evidence
1561192748819975,1:31:09,Born free,The Chair has such a deep voice he has to speak slowly
1561192754362165,1:31:15,TV Gee,Chairman is very attentive don’t be fooled
1561192787119638,1:31:47,Dabble Smith,"Not just attentive, but also attractive, very well dressed 😀"
1561192818816559,1:32:19,donovan daniels,but yet his a very considering chair
1561192822082281,1:32:22,Magda Seguin,"The DCJ is excellent,as someone who watched from the beginning of the commission I really have the utmost respect for him"

1561192854354522,1:32:55,Anne M.,@donovan daniels I think the DCJ is one of the most brilliant legal minds in the country. Don't be fooled by his soft spoken or politeness.
1561192863574568,1:33:04,Dabble Smith,"I agree Magda, and hope you are all having a great weekend."

1561193876034965,1:49:56,Michelle Kingsley,south adrica is the laughing stock of the world
1561193998658503,1:51:59,Ben Cole,"She,may have become a conduit. But not sure if it was willingly. She was used and her business stolen from her. Her “whistleblowing” brought this scam into the open. Still think she was conned."
1561194064235162,1:53:05,Mike Meyer,agreed Watson
1561194107910247,1:53:48,11soccerdad,Chairman Zondo is absolutely brilliant. The epitome of balance and justice. The Judiciary is the only hope this country has left.
1561194138260913,1:54:18,Lew464,she knew what she was in for. When she was not receiving what she was promised...decided to become a whistle-blower.
1561194149125476,1:54:29,Danie Nilsen,at half a million a pop i would also not ask many qeustions
1561194230051480,1:55:50,Born free,The question is.. is she a whistle blower.. did she volunteer to come to the commission or was she supeoned??
1561194237749749,1:55:58,Ben Cole,Has it been established what she contractually should have received for managing the two airports.

1561194290793940,1:56:51,Margareth Waterboer,"Ben, initially I had the same theory, but think she became whistleblower when she realised the 💩 was going 2hit the fan with this Commission. I'm confused with her... I hve same idea now as @Lew464"

1561194419018421,1:58:59,Margareth Waterboer,"Yes, @Watson"
1561194428166818,1:59:08,Reinette Raubenheimer,millions deposited into her account.... and she wasn't even on site..... no work was done....🤔.....red flags..... should have contacted her attorneys or crime investigating unit.... no excuses....

1561194530445236,2:00:50,Tsepang R,why didn't they test the recording before? poor preparation.

1561194665171465,2:03:06,Ben Cole,Yesterday she said she decided to whistleblow by threatening to go to a newspaper because she felt she had become a servant in her own company. But her “nativity” is beyond belief.

1561198936340094,3:14:16,Ben Cole,We no longer have to wonder why the NW province was placed under administration and why Mahumopelo was dismissed as premier.
1561198937694637,3:14:18,Thabang Aphane,Makes sense R 10 Million for 5 year period in once-off payment bases
1561198949452910,3:14:29,Magda Seguin,All the audit companies like KPMG and a host of other private companies like Trillian were involved...the corruption is VAST
1561198957696261,3:14:38,Norman Zwane,"@Born free @Thembisa Odendaal Despite my experience, I still voted ANC in 2009. Somehow I thought Zuma was the new dawn - I identified with him as a Zulu. How wrong I was. The ANC knew no nationality"
1561198966337599,3:14:46,Born free,It would seem the witness was paid R500 000 and then the business account was liquidated once all the funds had been looted.
1561198986775356,3:15:07,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,What a sad BEE case
1561199016271408,3:15:36,Thembisa Odendaal,@Ben Cole but Mahumapelo is now chair of chairs in parliament so the more skelm the better what a waste of time
1561199075079105,3:16:35,Norman Zwane,@Born free Her testimony was that she swept the last R20m into a seperate account to frustrate van Wyk. She wanted to keep a piece of the cake too.
1561199094991993,3:16:55,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,Supra is Game of Thrones 😃
1561199105703306,3:17:06,Magda Seguin,The Zuma faction put everything in place for CR to fail with the PP as the main actor

1561199167630673,3:18:08,Norman Zwane,"@Luvuyo Zantsi We know the CFO lied, she was many times caught in a lie. She was a lousy witness anyway."
1561199173311845,3:18:13,Magda Seguin,Taxpayers will gork out R61 billion to bail out Eskom.The Chinese are also closing in to take over.
1561199175624240,3:18:15,Anne M.,"The other questionable person, Nomvula Mokonyane is the Chair of Chairs"
1561199217489017,3:18:58,Willie Nwanati,"she said she will get 2million per annum, 50000"
1561199276821789,3:19:57,Ben Cole,"After today, the big six, must hang their heads and shame. Mr CR, we don’t want your high speed train and big new city dreams, many of your South Africans will be saying to themselves."
1561199278204361,3:19:58,Norman Zwane,@Luvuyo Zantsi Both this witness and Ngwenya testimonies contradicted hers.
1561199302862791,3:20:23,Magda Seguin,The Chinese signed 93 trade agreements with SA yesterday we will be re- colonised like the rest of Africa by the Chinese
1561199314065702,3:20:34,Born free,So now she is in control!
1561199317574817,3:20:38,Kevin Simon,so because she was sitting on R21m of laundered funds van who decided to fill her is and get her aboard with a longer term scheme.
1561199331261028,3:20:51,Robert Russell,CR is our only hope... the ANC have proven that they are morally corrupt...... as a collective
1561199368770738,3:21:29,Thembisa Odendaal,@Luvuyo I really get sick when I hear these name yes I really am not interested in the facts I heard though in the news that supra made some or other list which is disgusting he should not get a seat
1561199380324898,3:21:40,Born free,She gained control for more gains. She enjoyed money for nothing
1561199380916099,3:21:41,Thabang Aphane,"@Willie Nwanati yes she is contradicting herself, how come she earns same amount as Ministers"
1561199405590076,3:22:06,Kirk gemmell,I always said Africa will be recolonised before it’s own people realize how important morals are? The Chinese will be harder taskmasters watch they already have their own police in SA!!
1561199437503853,3:22:37,Sindiswa Moolman,She was part of the whole State Capture Corruption Project. She is a NW Agrizzi.
1561199458218780,3:22:58,Norman Zwane,@Robert Russell I'd be careful of that. I do not thin CR is our hope until we as a society take things into our own hands. CR represents a system. It may be refined but it is the same system.
1561199488239412,3:23:28,Ben Cole,Correct Norman Zwane
1561199502216451,3:23:42,Thembisa Odendaal,I bebelive the entire chain of the system is corrupt because how is it that the money goes into a bank account and there's no follow up in terms of sars
1561199516054319,3:23:56,Born free,See she can think and use big words when she wants to
1561199596607186,3:25:17,Norman Zwane,"@Thando Nkutha The narrative is that Cr was overtaken by the SG in order to douse the flames of these ongoing investigations. There is no way the ANC will investigate itself to death, it will stop."
1561199633201156,3:25:53,Albert Noah,"Maybe there is need to change the political system, CR cannot fire a lot of these guys because he might aiming for second term. The branches have too much power."
1561199643156503,3:26:03,Magda Seguin,"Putin is moving into Africa,he and Xi met recently,they must be planning to recognise and loot from Africa.I was always against BRICS,Zuma thought the was clever by asking for SA to be included"
1561199670647839,3:26:30,Magda Seguin,There is absolutely no benefit for SA in BRICS
1561199727072156,3:27:27,Norman Zwane,@Luvuyo Zantsi The divided ANC narrative is meant to suck us into thinking there is hope within the ANC. The truth is as I put it yesterday: Go into a brothel looking for a virgin
1561199767786231,3:28:08,Kirk gemmell,"The only benefit of Chinese or Russian take over will be no crime will be tolerated by anyone not connected ! Everyday crime will stop ,"
1561199785554861,3:28:25,Ben Cole,Our president and his executive must and will have to fight to overcome this widespread perception of corruption and hopelessness. Do this before it overcomes the nation’s psyche and belief in SA
1561199798746028,3:28:38,Thembisa Odendaal,unfortunately people cannot claim ignorance anymore like ultimately this lady will just like ms nhantsi who clearly was over her depth because being a CA does not automatically qualify you to run sa
1561199926575941,3:30:47,Born free,Are these airports functional???
1561200007170574,3:32:07,Magda Seguin,"Of you check on Cortiption Watch,Human Rights Watch etc you can see that China and Russia are oppressive states,they have horrific civil repression"
1561200098378873,3:33:38,Magda Seguin,I dont think the innocent SAs should pay for the evil deeds done under Zuma
1561200174356644,3:34:55,Kirk gemmell,"Horrific repression is precisely what I am eluding to , it’s happening in Zambia as we speak"
1561200197145833,3:35:17,Thabang Aphane,"I hope NPA SIU and HAwks are watching, this is must be enough for prosecution and further investigations to other implicated individuals"
1561200239153503,3:35:59,Magda Seguin,"I know @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ,I have lots of literature of dissidents during the cold war and others on the continuum of what happened up till now"

1561200679431465,3:43:19,Bernard Matolino,"Deputy Chief Justice Zondo, you are the man. Working on a Saturday is unheard of in public service. Even hospitals close on Saturdays!!!"
1561200688145766,3:43:28,Ben Cole,Can this witness be deemed complicit in this scam simply because it took her this long to whistleblow?
1561200740319569,3:44:20,Born free,Yes Ben she is complicit in money laundering.
1561200761478370,3:44:41,Reinette Raubenheimer,agree

1561200804190930,3:45:24,Magda Seguin,Hospitals close on Sayurdays??? Really? you must be referring to municipal clinics...no hospital in SA close on a Saturday.I am a healthcare professional working mostly in SA never heard of it
1561200809962693,3:45:30,Mhleli Sibanyoni,At the time she was complicit because she participated and agreed
1561200822374564,3:45:42,Bernard Matolino,@Born free That is what some of us have been saying since she took the stand

1561200870021228,3:46:30,Anne M.,"@Ben Cole I have mixed feelings about that. We need her evidence to prosecute the big fish, so there might be a negotiation about any prosecution of her."
1561200880344988,3:46:40,Bernard Matolino,@Magda Seguin Yesterday you were a corruption and fronting expert today you are an oncologist -- who works every Saturday
1561200887509017,3:46:47,Magda Seguin,"@Lex Luger go to my Twitrer profile and see my work,there is no truth in hospitals closing on a Saturday in SA"
1561200887968816,3:46:48,Sindiswa Moolman,She wants us to believe that she had some level of integrity.
1561200915467507,3:47:15,Magda Seguin,@Lex Luger you are a troll targeting me.Get off my case
1561200934259253,3:47:34,Bernard Matolino,"@Magda Seguin Ever heard of a figure of speech, euphemism?"
1561200979101170,3:48:19,Magda Seguin,I always have a troll on my back...blocked him
1561200988264014,3:48:28,Mhleli Sibanyoni,Please. This don't use this as a @Lex vs @Magda platform
1561200988930164,3:48:29,Bernard Matolino,@Magda Seguin You started with me. I was just being a cyberspace citizen and you interfered with my rights.

1561201002643406,3:48:43,Magda Seguin,Goodbye
1561201048662492,3:49:28,Bernard Matolino,@Born free And this witness knew exactly what was happening but now she wants to play victim
1561201067053828,3:49:47,Magda Seguin,Cyber bullying is a fulltime profession of some people
1561201119548627,3:50:39,Ben Cole,But must this witness also run?
1561201130756989,3:50:50,Magda Seguin,Spreading lies about hospitals closing on a Saturday cant be left unchallenged
1561201135179068,3:50:55,Mhleli Sibanyoni,When is Van Wyk coming to testify?
1561201143500195,3:51:04,Born free,They will all play victims but it won't save them from their corrupt deeds.

1561201194979474,3:51:55,Thembisa Odendaal,@Magda you should have really seen what lex luger was really saying commending dcj goodness you just made claims of being so well read and a guru of communism and you could not decifer a simple thing
1561201220150518,3:52:20,Bernard Matolino,Well nothing has happened to all who have been implicated on this forum. Remember Agrizzi's gripping testimony? Not even a local sergeant has called anyone in for basic questioning
1561201223605296,3:52:24,Mhleli Sibanyoni,"Thembisa, please let the matte rest"
1561201244951910,3:52:45,Magda Seguin,Zika really dont need to be preached to thank you.I am not a moron.

1561201307759032,3:53:48,Magda Seguin,"BTW I blocked him,he was on my case since yesterday,he can be lucky I tolerated him"
1561201309992346,3:53:50,Thabang Aphane,Money laundering at its best
1561201335780517,3:54:15,Bernard Matolino,@Ben Cole I think everyone must be allowed to make their point without some bullying from dark corners
1561201356546212,3:54:37,Born free,Gavin Watson will have to be extradited from Britian and I don't think that SA and Britian have such a treaty
1561201398718336,3:55:18,Mhleli Sibanyoni,Is Gavin Watson in UK. Was he allowed to leave SA?
1561201417035937,3:55:37,Thembisa Odendaal,@lex luger the issue here is people trying to be clever seriously are we so low in self esteem to behave so poorly in public no compassion for others I just want you to see I clever i am
1561201454260156,3:56:14,Born free,Watson has dual citizenship the NPA know where he is
1561201457118825,3:56:17,Bernard Matolino,@Mhleli Sibanyoni I also didn't know Gavin made a run for it. He copied the lowly Guptas
1561201472338924,3:56:32,Magda Seguin,I dont think I will go back to live in SA ever again
1561201482594118,3:56:43,Bernard Matolino,Hayibo she was arrested

1561201545335556,3:57:45,Willie Nwanati,"yep , but to my surprise she said she don't remember what charges was"
1561201567903631,3:58:08,Mhleli Sibanyoni,Hayi bo. I though dual is not allowed in SA. Hence Gigabytes was NOT supposed to have granted Guptas citizenship?
1561201568814054,3:58:09,Robert Russell,WITH DRAWN.....FFS.......
1561201575306629,3:58:15,Bernard Matolino,she doesn't even care what she was arrested for. even if i was arrested for public indecency I would remember that. Racketeering and she forgets?

1561201728551549,4:00:48,Margareth Waterboer,"Yes, there was @Anne, but he went to the commission with his old police name tag to listen in on the proceedings, but he was exposed."
1561201739423625,4:00:59,Sindiswa Moolman,This woman looks and sounds dodgy in her answers and body language
1561201754880048,4:01:15,Ben Cole,Lesson I have once again earnt. Wait until you have all the facts before you form an opinion about something/someone.

1561201776477858,4:01:36,Willie Nwanati,is what I thinks too
1561201800314290,4:02:00,Thembisa Odendaal,the law is coming for you you have to choose eu or as citizenship no more both why because you want both feet one train and one on another make you choice...we don't want to carry unnecessary takers

1561201869954168,4:03:10,Magda Seguin,"I have money here,family money so dont tell me about being a sponger"
1561201875851617,4:03:16,Sindiswa Moolman,"This woman is under investigation for her corruption etc., now decides to come here thinking that it will remove the charges."
1561201889291821,4:03:29,Thembisa Odendaal,you are the well read one so consult and confirm what I'm saying I'm just the novess

1561201978167752,4:04:58,Anne M.,@Margareth Waterboer Wasn't that a corrupt policeman on Bosasa's payroll that was trying to intimidate Agrizzi? A few weeks ago the NDPP said she would be appointing a member of her staff.

1561202036821519,4:05:57,Thembisa Odendaal,The dual citizenship is mostly kept for financial gain because they can claim oh I'm more in the ue therefore not pay tax here and then have a moerse lot to say

1561204403795290,4:45:23,Thembisa Odendaal,I just want to see an ounce of justice
1561204455026234,4:46:15,Bongumenzi Nxumalo,Fello Mkhize You are crazy!! Apartheid was evil
1561204460291180,4:46:20,Thembisa Odendaal,@sindiswa moolman I will hunt you down 😅
1561204476034128,4:46:36,Bonang Sithole,Tebogo Brian van Wyk
1561204482661689,4:46:43,Sindiswa Moolman,Hahaha @Thembisa Odendaal
1561204483843785,4:46:44,Ken Fer,this country is rich .the government can provide for service delivery to its citizens
1561204496736183,4:46:57,Norman Zwane,@Anne M. I remain corrected. The ANC had by then completely hollowed out the NPA just so there is never any come-back. I have serious doubts about our ability to ever revive the abilities of the NPA
1561204508271616,4:47:08,Andre Gerber,"CR keeping his enemies closer than his friends, that way thy can't run away and collect there orange suits"
1561204525028474,4:47:25,Ken Fer,corruption is killing this country
1561204546984408,4:47:47,Fello Mkhize,"imagine JZ, he couldn't even count nor write his English name and yet he headed the number one office."
1561204567419497,4:48:08,Thembisa Odendaal,@Luvuyo we just want to see that this was not all in vain
1561204607764886,4:48:48,Norman Zwane,@Luvuyo Zantsi I fear that the something which is done to reverse the rot is being strangled by the Ace;s of this world at birth. This revival will be a still-born.
1561204637946172,4:49:18,roberto wilco,Country is cactus
1561204674224635,4:49:54,Fello Mkhize,@Bongumenzi Nxumalo read what's in brackets baba
1561204704466983,4:50:24,Ken Fer,they must set a special corruption courts for speed of this case
1561204715969789,4:50:35,Norman Zwane,"@Luvuyo Zantsi SARS have not brought one crook to court yet. I suspect that will die an ordinary death. I have very little hope in all this @Luvuyo Zantsi personally, but I agree that others hope."
1561204740064366,4:51:00,roberto wilco,Absolutely nothing will happen from this enquiry
1561204772306920,4:51:32,Thembisa Odendaal,@Fello Mkhize I sometimes fear that it could mean there's nothing wrong with JZ but something seriously wrong with us to be duped by a guy with grade 3
1561204787290904,4:51:47,Norman Zwane,"@Luvuyo Zantsi I concede on Entities, but will that get a warm body to court or jail you think?"
1561204801024406,4:52:01,Anne M.,"@Luvuyo Zantsi You are right, justice moves slowly but the Eskom decision shows it is moving."
1561204853857717,4:52:54,Ken Fer,the problem is appointment of cadre's on government position while graduate arr at home
1561204869016648,4:53:09,Thembisa Odendaal,@Luvuyo we are super grateful for the strides but can you blame us for the skepticism they have really messed with us
1561204878075443,4:53:18,Anne M.,"I would rather the NPA take longer and get their ducks in a row to get a successful conviction, than them rushing to court and people are found not guilty due to a technicality."
1561204903188266,4:53:43,Thabiso Kolman,but what is reason for commission of inquiry cause none actions is been taken its money that is wasted on top what is captured
1561204936772438,4:54:16,Sindiswa Moolman,he is sooo corrupt. Thats why she still want her share of the loot.

1561205012696105,4:55:33,Mhleli Sibanyoni,"@Tholithemba Ntsele I don't care for ANC, DA or EFF. To me they are all the same. My observation is based on the way ""she"" is giving evidence. Does not sound normal"

1561205094571367,4:56:54,Thabiso Kolman,Its all ANC but with freedom comes much responsibility
1561205113707564,4:57:13,Anne M.,@Danie Nilsen There are many performers in this corruption circus.
1561205117323806,4:57:17,Fello Mkhize,"@Thembisa Odendaal,it even proves that the ANC is a criminal infested organisation since they allowed JZ to become a deputy president..during Mbheki's time"
1561205150562549,4:57:50,Ken Fer,but Brian will be in trouble with zondo questions when he comes
1561205157220529,4:57:57,Mhleli Sibanyoni,"@Tholithemba Ntsele, I am not saying she is lying. I am saying the way she is testifying is comical"
