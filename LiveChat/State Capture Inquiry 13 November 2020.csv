1605250104670886,-58:10,ZuenTheMan,"@Paula Cooke Hi, Mr Daniel Mantsha from Denel will be in the Hot Steat at 9:30AM"
1605250462591033,-52:12,Aubrey De Bliquy,It is clear the ANC government is incompetent and the EFF is worse before we start the false group white guilt argument. 3 million immigrants need at least 2500 new schools. Did we build them? NO
1605250910848034,-44:44,Aubrey De Bliquy,"If we have no borders, we have no country."
1605251402717427,-36:32,ALTA,@Aubrey De Bliquy do you see me?
1605251513641760,-34:41,ZuenTheMan,@ALTA Hi again. 🙂
1605251872365104,-28:43,ALTA,@ZuenTheMan... we must stop meeting like this😂😂😂😂
1605252036904406,-25:58,Zinhle Big Daddy Dee,ACE Magashule is in the fire now
1605252040260792,-25:55,ZuenTheMan,@ALTA Haha we clearly have the same interests.
1605252121568582,-24:33,Mntase,@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee Very nice day today. Ace and Mantsha getting fried. I smell KFC
1605252123202617,-24:32,Zinhle Big Daddy Dee,Aubrey de Bliquy i just got in time while u are talking badly about the Red bus. But since u know everything what is better than EFF??
1605252170998025,-23:44,M Place,VBs
1605252176156173,-23:39,Zinhle Big Daddy Dee,@Mntase ANC say he is innocent how do we ignore so much evidence??
1605252218534666,-22:57,Zinhle Big Daddy Dee,@Aubrey De Bliquy??????
1605252219455480,-22:56,Mntase,"If they say he is innocent, who are we to disagree..😂🤣"
1605252225729633,-22:49,M Place,ANC must be guilty for protecting corrupt people...
1605252268895553,-22:06,Zinhle Big Daddy Dee,@M Place people are desperate to see the ANC we use to love
1605252340068347,-20:55,M Place,"Dee, I agree...but the lives of our people are getting worse...we must keep people accountable"
1605252379985894,-20:15,Mntase,"In any case, I have 2 screens, one for Ace, one for Mantsha and my popcorn machine is warming up"
1605252471533840,-18:44,Aubrey De Bliquy,hI @ALTA
1605252556541289,-17:19,Aubrey De Bliquy,sORRY MY ETHERNET WAS UNPLUGGED
1605252624640588,-16:10,Zinhle Big Daddy Dee,@Aubrey De Bliquy what should we vote for if ANC and EFF is worse
1605252683770890,-15:11,Aubrey De Bliquy,"@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee EFF minus the falacious group white guilt trip which is sort of off putting because try as much as I can, I cant stop being white and I only have one life."
1605252746287546,-14:09,ZuenTheMan,@Aubrey De Bliquy Probably the best comment I have read. 👍
1605252779823102,-13:35,Aubrey De Bliquy,I may vote ANC for the first time if there is an attempt to fix what is broken.
1605252829216137,-12:46,ALTA,@ZuenTheMan indeed we have😁😁
1605252966387295,-10:29,Aubrey De Bliquy,We will have to fast track effective on line home or remote schooling to bring the best teachers and language use to bear on our challenge to rise.
1605253061190506,-8:54,Zinhle Big Daddy Dee,@Aubrey De Bliquy WHAT MUST WE VOTE FOR?????
1605253199422969,-6:36,Aubrey De Bliquy,ANd then unfortunately a lot of horrible ideas and nasty race exploitation for votes which makes us all victims.
1605253251681253,-5:43,Aubrey De Bliquy,Especially because we are making enemies out of potential friens and allies. We cannot do this in enmity. Lets stop fooling ourselves.
1605253267442175,-5:28,ALTA,wow saw now some people in Bloemfontein say ace is innocent
1605253310789656,-4:44,Aubrey De Bliquy,@ALTA tha is why we must never rush to judge
1605253415924271,-2:59,Aubrey De Bliquy,We cannot ignore the possibility of a witch hunt. Abuse of executive power for partisan political agendae will alwyas be here no matter who governs. Nuance is everything.
1605253505161202,-1:30,Aubrey De Bliquy,If you can't make things better at least don't make them worse. This is why executive and judiciary cannot be cadre deployment zones without destroying the state.
1605253799175812,3:09,Aubrey De Bliquy,That is what happens when the judiciary become a cadre deployment zone like the executive. Law cannot be selective but it must not be abused for partisan withc hunts.

1605253882701159,4:34,Aubrey De Bliquy,Sometimes our law rightly gives the guilty immunity if the case against them was procured illegally thwarting the accused rights.
