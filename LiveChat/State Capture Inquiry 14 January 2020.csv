1578993157489314,1:13:28,Pastor J.J,This Commission is too lenient with this skelm.
1578993163328393,1:13:34,Derek Main,Let them put him on a stretcher and he can testify on his back.

1578993240002662,1:14:50,Derek Main,@Lex Luger Exactly - and look at how well that has worked for Shaik. It's a miracle!!!
1578993251280315,1:15:03,Kevin Simon,Maybe Showerhead is going senile? Or does it sound like he may get better?
1578993265076955,1:15:16,Bernard Matolino,The country is dying because of this skelem Zuma and he must be laughing at our collective naivete

1578993476620959,1:18:47,Thulani Bukani,@Derek Main so true. How can it be fair for him to keep telling us his eagerness and willingness to appear but always finds ways to duck and dive.

1578993996763325,1:27:27,Derek Main,There only reason Zuma takes so much flak about not appearing is because we have seen how he operates. The Stalingrad strategy.
1578994007546912,1:27:38,Anne M.,"@Elvis Malakoane Correct, but he pleads poverty and has had people bail him out financially over the years - Shaik, Gupta and so on. Maybe the Guptas are paying?"

1578995108289029,1:45:59,Derek Main,Koloane should be in jail for treason.

1578995296443051,1:49:07,Derek Main,Horrific conditions - exactly what the state capturers deserve. I think we need to start taking away rights of certain categories of criminals.

1578995514601806,1:52:45,Derek Main,@Moeletsi Wabatho Just Zuma giving more lame excuses as to why he won't appear at commission.
1578995521618288,1:52:52,Elvis Malakoane,not a lot just started
1578995630534489,1:54:41,Moeletsi Wabatho,LOL that old man is very calculated in his tricks but it will catch up with him and I bet we all cant wait to see the outcome..
1578995684195329,1:55:34,Derek Main,I say let him testify on a stretcher.
1578995723925829,1:56:14,Derek Main,His only valid excuse for not appearing is because he is dead.
1578995824323270,1:57:56,Derek Main,Seems like Zondo has not heard about Shaik. Zuma will never be well enough to appear if he has his own way.
1578995900942249,1:59:11,Elvis Malakoane,commission will have to go to nkandla and work from there to make him testify
1578995970278770,2:00:20,Derek Main,Remember Mubarak testifying from a bed in his trial - Zuma can do the same.
1578996030599898,2:01:21,Elvis Malakoane,and Mubarak was also very evasive till conviction
1578996071541534,2:02:02,Pastor J.J,@Derek Main... Quite frankly I care less if he was dead and in a coffin as long as he testifies and then they can move him to the prison mortuary for cross examination later.hehehehehe
1578996094636357,2:02:25,Derek Main,@Elvis Malakoane Yes - the Egyptians got tired of the nonsense. When are we SAfns going to get tired of Zuma's BS.
1578996161736788,2:03:33,Derek Main,@Pastor J True that - he must testify even if he is dead üòÇ
1578996181349545,2:03:52,Elvis Malakoane,is a person born a crook or it is something you learn or is it a form of revenge for disfunctional upbringing
1578996237668116,2:04:49,Derek Main,@Elvis Malakoane I like to think it's learned behaviour but I'm not certain.
1578996311117747,2:06:02,Elvis Malakoane,it's a complex personality nothing of this person is normal or honest

1578998194061164,2:37:24,Bev Daniels,"So is the EFF, check out VBS etc they also have been STEALING MONEY"
1578998211926938,2:37:42,Pastor J.J,As corrupt as Malema and Shivambu stealing the poor peoples money from VBs
1578998219939725,2:37:50,Kevin Simon,This lady did not want to stir things up so she has narrowed her focus so as not to show she turned a blind eye and did not blow the whistle.
1578998231028939,2:38:01,SONGEZO MNCOKO,it's about time and power of persuasion and gain majority
1578998247398006,2:38:18,SONGEZO MNCOKO,true
1578998250482638,2:38:21,Peter Sant,"@Derek main, whether you like or not. the freedom you enjoy brought by ANC"
1578998273404069,2:38:44,Derek Main,@SONGEZO MNCOKO It's not about persuasion - it's about corruption and feeding at the trough.
1578998275411345,2:38:45,Pastor J.J,@EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA ...No chance after what Malema and Shivambu did with the VBS money
1578998288555468,2:38:59,Bev Daniels,"Eff student - sjoe another five years of EFF then this country will be totally destroyed, which it is now, but it will be worse, STARVING ETC"
1578998305067378,2:39:16,Dominic Przybylski,"@EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA EFF will destroy the economy in far less than 5 years. There will be nothing left to save after ""giving EFF a chance""."
1578998368907631,2:40:19,Elvis Malakoane,Peter Sant very true ANC played a very important role for our freedom But my mother or father has no right to abuse me because of she gave birth to me
1578998392903035,2:40:43,Pastor J.J,Well said @Elvis Malakoane
1578998411725150,2:41:02,Peter Sant,"@Derek main, and put EFF?"
1578998421615147,2:41:12,Bev Daniels,"Ayoba, please you must open your eyes. Not wanting to sound racist, but show me one country in Africa is really thriving. Zim was such a rick country and NOW!!!! sAME FOR SA DOWN THE DRAIN"
1578998487149302,2:42:18,Pule Pholoana,EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA give EFF what chance? We are not guinea pigs and our State is not a laboratory. A drop of a beer has all the properties of a beer. Malema and his crew are ANC factory faults.
1578998567836725,2:43:38,Bev Daniels,"@Pule, very well said AGREE"
1578998596229658,2:44:06,Peter Sant,"@Derek main, if you say ANC must go.who must be in power"
1578998608213096,2:44:19,SONGEZO MNCOKO,"ANC and DA have been tested and failed to masses, only alternative is EFF"
1578998638946817,2:44:50,Dominic Przybylski,Even FF+ is better alternative than EFF
1578998666842846,2:45:17,Andr√© du Plessis,anarchy would be more organised
1578998672017284,2:45:23,Derek Main,@Peter Sant I voted for UDM but there are many choices - something like 50 parties were registered. Just definitely not a party as corrupt as the ANC.
1578998689928962,2:45:40,Bev Daniels,What remorse does EFF have even after Zuma they also stole and are still stealing and informing their members a LOAD OF rubbish
1578998692331033,2:45:43,Pastor J.J,@EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA ...have you been drinking something stronger than tea today? The EFF and the thieves who run it will be in jail this year. 2020. guaranteed.
1578998714904273,2:46:06,Derek Main,The EFF seem to be as corrupt as the ANC.
1578998798164622,2:47:29,Pule Pholoana,Bev Daniels you people are the cause of all these; all u do is to cause confusion in Africa so that u can steal our resources and enrich Europe and Africa. Our leaders mess Africa with u people.
1578998806145951,2:47:36,Syug,She knew that had she expressed any concerns about the wedding party landing she would have been labeled ‚Äúracist‚Äù!
1578998816117188,2:47:47,Pastor J.J,You have a better chance of marrying a donkey and the marriage being recognised in law than the EFF becoming government@EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA
1578998836628003,2:48:07,Peter Sant,"@Derek main, it's better the devel I know than others"
1578998836765003,2:48:07,Derek Main,"@Pule Pholoana ""you people"" Sounds a bit racist to me."
1578998860898306,2:48:31,Derek Main,@Peter Sant No - I don't go along with those BS quotes.
1578998912765086,2:49:23,Bev Daniels,"Pule please, I was born and bred here so what does that tell you."
1578999059411385,2:51:49,Pule Pholoana,‚ÄãBev Daniels you people are the cause of all these; all u do is to cause confusion in Africa so that u can steal our resources and enrich Europe and America. Our leaders mess Africa with u people.
1578999092225563,2:52:22,Derek Main,@Pule Pholoana Racist much?
1578999117173197,2:52:48,Pastor J.J,@Pule Pholoana Did the school bell ring early today?
1578999141015818,2:53:11,Andr√© du Plessis,#youpeople #racist
1578999166482725,2:53:37,Derek Main,@Kevin Aaah - the Ramaphoria argument. He's part of the problem. Where was he while the Guptas and Zuma were plundering?
1578999198290576,2:54:09,Kevin,"All we need is to respect the President and TRUST him to do the right thing. If Cyril gets tough on the ANC mafia, there will be thousands of ""white votes"" coming his way."
1578999247140904,2:54:57,Derek Main,@Kevin NEVER trust a politician. Any politician.
1578999251688179,2:55:01,Kevin,There is NOBODY else Derek hahaha...We are limited in choice
1578999283485384,2:55:34,Bev Daniels,"Another break what now lunch, costs money, money money"
1578999303830006,2:55:55,Kevin,If you look at the world today...It seems democracy is falling apart. Makes one wonder
1578999304591982,2:55:55,Pule Pholoana,"Derek Main the disrespect that comes after ""with all due respect"" is the same as the racist remarks that comes after ""I don't wanna sound racist"" and that's what u just did and retract your steps..."
1578999332565243,2:56:23,Moshoeu Mabusela,"@Pule Pholoana. your right. All whites are preparing to leave SA. They are busy sending their money offshore, that's why our economy is bad, their companies moving head offices to other countries."
1578999344724358,2:56:35,Derek Main,@Pule Pholoana Please show me where I used either of those phrases.
1578999449335911,2:58:20,Derek Main,@Pule Pholoana Reciprocating is racism.
1578999618439643,3:01:09,David Tuer,It's obvious that Judge Zondo has never been in the Army !!!
