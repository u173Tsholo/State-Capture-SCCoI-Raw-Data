1581927707747952,18:12,Anne M.,She got a bit emotional about a witness who has received death threats
1581927788344031,19:33,Zizi Skosana,"the death threats about the witness got her emotional, I never thought she would cry. We are all human beings after all"
1581927803558504,19:47,Vuyo Tshekela,"can someone correct Kate that it's Mhlathuze, not Mhlathuz"
1581927849385168,20:34,anya van loggerenberg,@Anne M. she probably knows how it feels to receive death threats 😢 #StayStrongKate
1581927877358757,21:02,Anne M.,"@anya van loggerenberg Yes, that thought also crossed my mind"
1581927883635315,21:07,What A Day 😏🙄😂🤔😍🤒🙆‍♂️,mhlathuz what does it mean ..? I know its a place .in kzn ..
1581927904299567,21:28,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Anne M. The fact that he/she has received death threats means that people who want him/he dead they now him/her already why hiding his identity (he is already under witness protection) this is bull
1581927992317678,22:55,Mbuso Ndlovu,Zuma received death threats but no one protected him😀😁😂😂😂😂
1581928039006384,23:43,What A Day 😏🙄😂🤔😍🤒🙆‍♂️,who is testifying today ?
1581928052062577,23:55,Vuyo Tshekela,@Mbuso Zuma has high protection services 24/7! does he need more
1581928088587390,24:33,anya van loggerenberg,@Mbuso Ndlovu he probably sent death threats to himself 😒
1581928088629458,24:33,Anne M.,@Mbuso Ndlovu The witness protection has only now been put in place. JZ had 24 hour protection and as far as I know still has protection paid for by us.

1581928241870327,27:06,Craig Woodward,@anya van loggerenberg I cannot see the Advocate would shed tears if she at all thought it wasn't a credible threat to life... It's not right to speculate that way... It's wrong!
1581928250104138,27:14,ncamisile Radebe,does he needs protection from his family??
