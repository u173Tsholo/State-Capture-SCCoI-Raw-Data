1569932643947815,20:35,Born free,Naidu did not start his career in the Police he was employed by one of the persons implicated in this enquiry and then given rankings by the same person.
1569932665863079,20:57,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,I think the commission should close in on captured journalism
1569932772597757,22:45,Born free,Non of these Police Intelligence are qualified persons they were simply employed and promoted very quickly.
1569932776541977,22:49,Nyasimi Geoffrey,@Gee Peex1 how are you today we havent engaged since friday
1569932781524829,22:53,Nyasimi Geoffrey,hope you well
1569932912141786,25:05,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,"with credit, Malema did say years ago that cringe intelligence needed to be looked into"
1569932928124223,25:20,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,crime*
1569932962963703,25:55,Born free,So should Malema be Investigated. The pot calling the kettle black.
1569933004065357,26:36,Pastor J.J,Hearsay evidence is admissable in law when it can be collaborated.
1569933028723533,27:01,Terance Nzuza,What if criminals are sometimes released to commit crimes....
1569933084098817,27:56,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,give ppl benefit of doubt. the country owes Malema a great deal regardless of party affiliation
1569933135523714,28:48,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 Yes. Especially if I say that Tom advised that he committed a crime and Tom confirms that he did say so. It is no longer hearsay.
1569933141327029,28:53,Born free,No-one owes Malema anything
1569933169296261,29:22,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,play the ball before you play the man. this its why corruption thrives because the fight back is divided. think #zumamustgo March
1569933188434688,29:40,Born free,The Witness is picking his nose
1569933268150930,31:00,Terance Nzuza,40G

1569933279639356,31:11,Norman Zwane,"So is Ranjeni Munusammy a journalist or a secret service operative? Ditto Mzilikazi wa Afrika, Hoffstarter, Rampedi, Karima Brown"
1569933305726246,31:38,Kay Kay,Zondo's humor is entertaining🤣🤣
1569933314595786,31:47,Smart Guys,Zondo is sharp R40.0

1569933372284641,32:44,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,what hasn't she. she's basically a politician
1569933391224564,33:03,Norman Zwane,@Lex Luger Is she a journalist or an operative?
1569933406691157,33:19,Smart Guys,is Karima involved guy's
1569933422676080,33:35,Kay Kay,"hallo online analysts, I had a long lunch anything significant I miss"
1569933431417452,33:43,Bernard Matolino,@Pastor J I am very well mfundisi. Sending you lots of brotherly love!!!

1569933539555627,35:31,Kay Kay,I read someone wrote about Mzilika waAfrika and Piet Rampedi here on the chat. are they also named?
1569933545110171,35:37,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,any way she was found to be partial by the courts Karima
1569933581096952,36:13,Speckled Trim,Ok heard enough from this witness. next!
1569933583850196,36:16,Terance Nzuza,this is messy
1569933607876852,36:40,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,but they didn't mask his voice lol
1569933612312261,36:45,Pastor J.J,@redriger ...They only become admissible if the court exercises its power to admit hearsay evidence under Law of Evidence Amendment Act.
1569933622442860,36:55,videoboer,sjo but these guys are skelm and corrupt
1569933633479172,37:06,Norman Zwane,@Lex Luger Oh maybe she's just been demonised by the EFF?
1569933676502453,37:48,Norman Zwane,This witness does not know a blank cheque
1569933686324117,37:59,Pastor J.J,"@redriger Hearsay evidence is not admissible in court unless a statue or rule provides otherwise. Therefore, even if a statement is really hearsay, it may still be admissible if an exception applies."
1569933695193142,38:08,Speckled Trim,Witness is wasting g
1569933695726620,38:08,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,you can tell by her reporting
1569933703651960,38:16,Speckled Trim,*state resources
1569933708085793,38:20,Pastor J.J,"@redriger Generally, state law follows the rules of evidence as provided in the Federal Rules of Evidence, but not in all cases."
1569933754681136,39:07,Kay Kay,he's contradicting himself now
1569933755283840,39:07,Terance Nzuza,what if Zondo's name pops up?
1569933767030444,39:19,Pastor J.J,@redriger In my 1st message I did say that it is accepted only when confirmed as truthful evidence and collaborated
1569933807842699,40:00,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,"why is it so obvious that PP omits Ace from frede dairy, but nobody can see BOSASA donations and supposed contracts omitted from Karima's broadcasts??"
1569933846093894,40:39,Pastor J.J,@redriger You are right.
1569933852128048,40:44,Terance Nzuza,anything is possible...Zondo is feeling the seriousness....it wont be business as usual in our SOE
1569933882370954,41:15,Speckled Trim,Conspiracy theory: 1 Witness is not being entirely truthful OR 2 Witness was coached and not given enough info. Where else would all the assumptions come from?
1569933884357368,41:16,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,her guests bring it up and she shifts topics lightspeed fast
1569933905411336,41:39,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,@ LEX
1569933911594876,41:43,Kay Kay,Are the Hanekom attorneys related to the ANC Dirk Hanekom?
1569933955151770,42:27,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,right. but u get my point Gee?
1569933984213008,42:56,Paul Buchel,"@Brother Louis​, True, he is not making sense now."
1569933996717902,43:09,Terance Nzuza,Mdluli's smile...he'll take all SOE down south with him...
1569934019709787,43:31,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,"lol read up, chief"
1569934043012198,43:55,Pastor J.J,@redriger The bulk of his evidence is based on facts and 1st hand information where he was present or involved. The hearsay is not being explored but further investigated as per DCJ
1569934144720186,45:36,Norman Zwane,@redriger The guy was just an unemployed relative more blunt than a butter knife. He don't know an assumption from a fact or a blank cheque. The guy was a dangerous fool that would become a snitch
1569934146614155,45:38,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,haha. I was cosigning someone. saying easy to see PP(BM) omit Ace from frede report but ppl don't notice certain journalist omit BOSASA donations and fake contracts
1569934215942122,46:48,Kay Kay,"Gee Peex1, And what about the current PP do you think she's a hired gun to finish Cyril or not?"
1569934233920539,47:05,Pastor J.J,"@redriger Remember when he throws those bits of infoaround in the manner that he does,he cant be cross examined but the commission will investigate it neverthless. Shrewd but it works"
1569934278071534,47:50,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,I'm just so sorry the Red throw their weight behind this New PP
1569934288669391,48:00,Norman Zwane,@Bronx Wavy Give this fool a few more hours and I'm sure Mkhwebane's hairdo will come out as paid for by the spooks slush funds
1569934313538764,48:25,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,😂😂
1569934364561473,49:16,Speckled Trim,This witness' testimony will be taken with a pinch of salt. His credibility is doubtful.
1569934369165571,49:21,Kevin Simon,The only part of the Crime Intelligence moniker that is correct is the Crime bit. The Intelligence part is a misnomer.
1569934375748565,49:28,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,"Busisiwe: _""I'm doing my work""_"
1569934381823446,49:34,Crown Glass and Aluminium,small nails hold a big coffin together
1569934436115965,50:27,Pastor J.J,@Crown Glass and Aluminium Thats a very intelligent comment. Thats exactly how I see and hear this evidence
1569934471811617,51:04,Speckled Trim,"a lot of smoke, looking for flames"
1569934485263681,51:17,Cameron Shaw,wits going on bois
1569934580769667,52:53,Kay Kay,But will his evidence not be reduced to nothing with a thorough cross examination?
1569934600341932,53:13,Jean-Pierre Le Roux,Eskom burning pensions because they burnt their money long ago
1569934625614810,53:38,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,what happened to Maleka guys?
1569934642185721,53:55,Speckled Trim,"He has absolutely no concrete evidence. And the issues seem like fraud, more than state capture. This was a CI management issue, unless we move up one or two levels."
1569934682624626,54:35,ENTERE,Can a leather jacket be gangsta
1569934724082054,55:16,Speckled Trim,🤣
1569934734609811,55:27,Pastor J.J,@Sean Johnson I hope so. I have a leather jacket
1569934744766599,55:37,Kay Kay,"@Bronx Wavy, I understand SC Maleka left a long time ago but I don't why"
1569934761831664,55:54,Norman Zwane,@Brother Louis None what so ever - just TALL TALES
1569934791109149,56:24,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,he came with the fire
1569934806148558,56:38,ENTERE,I really want to know can a leather jacket be gangsta
1569934828319185,57:01,Speckled Trim,Norman agreed 101%. Many of these issues should have been raised/reported internally. Why wait so long...
1569934847009973,57:19,Norman Zwane,@Bronx Wavy Zondo's star witness
1569934849312243,57:21,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,crime intelligence went into real estate aswell
1569934900347710,58:12,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,@Sean see Pelle jacket$
1569934918806055,58:31,Norman Zwane,@redriger Jeni was an open 'SECRET AGENT'
1569934930962663,58:43,videoboer,They have houses in Clifton
1569934944126005,58:57,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,they had scams around sq footage
1569934957372437,59:09,Terance Nzuza,If intelligence refers to mind state/capabilities....how is academia immune here....who processes these processes?...i'm writing an Epi.c
1569934973032664,59:26,Pastor J.J,@Brother Louis That is the reason he is in Witness Protection for 9 years. He started spilling the beans for 9 years now. People have been fired and criminal chards are pending
1569934998360117,59:50,Yolo More,Don't lose focus guys.The fact that some of his evidence is a hearsay does not necessarily mean it's not the truth. This is corruption by people who were supposed to fight corruption.
1569935000440301,59:52,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,lol its open now
1569935021964969,1:00:14,Norman Zwane,@redriger I'm on a popcorn binge myself
1569935041991323,1:00:34,Terance Nzuza,the guy is sweating....
1569935074959554,1:01:07,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,the 1 guy who seen a sentence
1569935093446963,1:01:26,Speckled Trim,"@Pastor J thank you for the info. This means that investigations were ""frozen"" and never pursued by any leader since. Quite shocking!"
1569935118433034,1:01:50,Kay Kay,"@Brother Louis, the guy said the intelligence world is not like your normal work environment were issues are just brought and open up for scrutiny like your ordinary office set up. 😃😃"
1569935126511433,1:01:58,Pastor J.J,@redriger Dont be misunderstood. Witness Protection is possibly worse in many respects than Prison.
1569935154947896,1:02:26,Nicky Klue,rotten to the core . life goes on . and on . nothing done since . 11 s total disgrace
1569935161883358,1:02:34,Pastor J.J,@Brother Louis Thats correct. The crooks were protecting each other like blood brothers.
1569935165535418,1:02:38,Speckled Trim,"@Kay Kay, wow! This is true, but doesnt mean you turn a blind eye to personal favors."
1569935229235464,1:03:41,Norman Zwane,@Gee Peex1 HOw the wheel turns
1569935233654345,1:03:46,Speckled Trim,"@Pastor J it's sad. This is common practice everywhere. ""Turning blind eye"" :("
1569935280480075,1:04:32,kevindbn007,hey everyone....errr wheres the video feed of this witness
1569935322943198,1:05:15,Pastor J.J,@redriger Dont forget to remember that Naidoo was unskilled and unemployed when Gen Lazarus employed him in CI has they are relatives.

1569935503335882,1:08:15,Austin Van Rensburg,Even Q7 is a beast on its own
1569935538568979,1:08:50,Norman Zwane,@redriger As a witness he is Mdluli's passport to a case where the state cannot prove its case. If I was Mdluli's attorney I'd be praying the guy is the state's chief witness. He'd tie himself up.
1569935567983381,1:09:20,Kay Kay,"@Redriger, The life of a spy is to spy on everything including the next spy that's normal"
1569935568943674,1:09:21,Pastor J.J,@Thulani Bukani Hi brother. Nice to see you here on the chat again. I pray you are well

1569935763050157,1:12:35,Thulani Bukani,African National Congress maybe? posing as the saviour of the masses from poverty. @Austin Van Rensburg
1569935766443379,1:12:39,Norman Zwane,I've run out of popcorn guys and this is boring. Cheers.

1569935910507829,1:15:03,Nicky Klue,icona not my chair
1569935924778225,1:15:17,Pastor J.J,@redriger I honestly dont know about him. I liked Chris Barnard though. hahahahahaha
1569935973915488,1:16:06,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,counterfeit teabags must be investigated. DCJ is sick
1569936008048680,1:16:40,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 Have you ever committed a crime and what was it?
1569936023224196,1:16:55,Queen K,No sound on my side😳😳😳
1569936085754541,1:17:58,Queen K,Thanks
1569936100437834,1:18:12,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 and then ate it?
1569936142388222,1:18:55,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,he bled to death internally
1569936142985699,1:18:55,Kzheka,Im live
1569936145249600,1:18:57,Pastor J.J,@redriger Every bit of intelligent evidence so far seems to indicate anything but a suicide. But.......
1569936146457515,1:18:58,Austin Van Rensburg,@Thulani Bukani Yes but then they decided to enslave themselves again....then shift the blame...as you can see how they are currently implicated in all sorts of crimes and corruption acts.
1569936202525151,1:19:55,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 Did Gavin Watson commit suicide or was murdered?
1569936285401625,1:21:17,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,he left it open for your interpretation
1569936297656436,1:21:30,Pastor J.J,@redriger That in itself creates every doubt about the suicide theory. But then again more sinister things have happened in this country. The question like who killed Hani comes to mind again
1569936336607804,1:22:08,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 You just may be on the right track
1569936344561212,1:22:17,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,Pastor that's the one that needs to start the REAL clean sweep
1569936367389101,1:22:39,Pastor J.J,@redriger I am in total agreement with you
1569936391049631,1:23:04,Pastor J.J,@Bronx Wavy Absolutely right my friend
1569936403473387,1:23:15,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,churches are party to proxy funerals. shameful
1569936440103493,1:23:52,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,man did not die. sorry to say
1569936473958191,1:24:26,Pastor J.J,@redriger I have my thoughts. Hopefully we will see one of them BACK at the commission soon
1569936479716504,1:24:32,Thulani Bukani,well @Austin Van Rensburg did black south Africans do that or was it ANC elites and associates?

1569937064015682,1:34:16,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,correct I was about to say the same @ Pastor
1569937092695569,1:34:45,Singi Mathebula,i think we now understand why Batohi is not moving😪 corruption was like ebola in the JCPS cluster.

1569937214479757,1:36:47,Yolo More,Pastor J are you real pastor or a journalist?
1569937232043338,1:37:04,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,Batohi stepped into her role on the ticket of speedy high-profile prosecutions.. so far I count zero

1569937367517908,1:39:20,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,if there isn't enough evidence to close the book on Esidemeni then who exactly is going to jail for anything else?
1569937370364591,1:39:22,Pastor J.J,@Yolo More . That was a pecular question?
1569937431482183,1:40:23,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,"a Zuma literally got away with murder because although he was speeding in the rain, its not clear he could FORSEE an accident happening"
1569937442250311,1:40:34,Singi Mathebula,"nobody ,probably Zuma himself new the extent of corruption and lawlessness in the NPA because it was free for all. Thanks to president ""what have i done"""

1569937596057272,1:43:08,Speckled Trim,"This investigation can potentially go on forever and cause the downfall of many public officials. ""State Capture"" seems like a lazy way of describing all the corruption by willing participants."
1569937603585172,1:43:16,Pastor J.J,@redriger Yes and I wondered what was the trigger
1569937620318678,1:43:32,Thulani Bukani,@Austin then we are saying the same thing. Black south Africans didn't do this. it was greed from ANC guys and their friends. what's there to look deeper into?

1569937840209406,1:47:11,Pastor J.J,@redriger That was a convenient convenience. Financially and otherwise
1569937863357590,1:47:36,Pastor J.J,@redriger ???
1569937945104954,1:48:57,Deon de Swardt,Irony of this Commission that has costed us over R350m so far is that all of it is known already to the Hawks. Where is the NPA in all of this ??!!
1569937945780651,1:48:58,Ndidendavela Nam Bathembu Mgudlwa,"The chairperson must ask for 40k from CI so that the Dr can come to the commission and consult with him, he really is not feeling well"

1569938256804665,1:54:10,Danie Nilsen,and so we listen to others bad doings but forget the tree in our own eye we must forgive those who sinned against us so that we can do the same
1569938257456456,1:54:10,Pastor J.J,@redriger There was many and still are many honest ones out there. But they are suppressed. The fact os that if honest Prosecution took place now we will not have much of a Govt left to rule.
