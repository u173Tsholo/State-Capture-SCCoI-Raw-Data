1537350078431901,2:05:06,Andrew Mc Farlane,@sakhile mtshali I thinnk you should testify with all your evidence.
1537350111533058,2:05:38,Nelson Musoliwa,What do these graphic illustration about state capture say to Zuma? Does he even understand when they say enablers of state capture. Waht a shame my former president

1537351883705386,2:35:10,sakhile mtshali,We cant hear what was suspicious transactions that these companies where involved in.
1537351886246984,2:35:13,Fils de l'homme,@peter pott without us there would not be water
1537351915594592,2:35:43,Wildthing,"Sakhile they will start to ask the question on why 4 ministers went to Dubai in one week including Zuma for no real country reason. the answer they carried cash, gold, diamonds out as government"
1537351916336467,2:35:43,Peet Venter,"ALL govt officials should be forced to only use public institutions like hospitals, clinics and schools."

1537351980979256,2:36:48,Fils de l'homme,@peter pott r u the only one who is unaware that SA has water issues ?
1537351996863395,2:37:04,Wildthing,And by taking 20% ftomeach contract like new trains that don't fit. but commission paid outside SA.
1537352005789861,2:37:13,Mutumwa Mawere,State capture - in what form does a state exist and what would capturing it entail. Is it the capture of the person of Zuma or a generic state?
1537352014436525,2:37:21,Motopi Seleka Jr,#Shakile has a point the former PP' state of capture report makes a lot of allegations instead of findings..... the very report suggested that we should have this current inquiry which legal it too is
1537352020788521,2:37:28,peter pott,Fils! there is no water crises here. management crises it is.
1537352023198156,2:37:30,Motopi Seleka Jr,an investigation exercise - but it too appears to be making allegations instead of answers the PP thought will be found in it. this Inquiry is overrated
1537352031997248,2:37:39,sakhile mtshali,There is no proof of Gupta involvement there @Michael Wild
1537352052345231,2:38:00,Fils de l'homme,@Street Cred that is why white ppl have a burden to help Bantu so that they can improve
1537352063988426,2:38:11,Kingsley Mathe,"@Fils de l'homme, you must also understand you came from cave and this is the reason why your behaviour will always be animal like"

1537352082853312,2:38:30,Wildthing,Not paying Tax. moving it out of the country starts to weaken the country too.
1537352105996383,2:38:52,ntselelechesa,I think Kaufmann is undermining our thinking capability; Countries in transition can invite the investors in a transparent way through their legitimate channels - FDI.

1537352194564143,2:40:21,ntselelechesa,Like he said I think he is not aware of and/or studied our current matter regarding STATE CAPTURE; ZUMA and his cohorts misdirected public funds to fraudsters for his indirect benefit through his son
1537352198722659,2:40:26,sakhile mtshali,"If there was something, Gupta will be in jail by now"

1537352556757258,2:45:47,sakhile mtshali,@makhosi nobhatyi what is wasting time is listening to these banks lie that there was no colluding
1537352574274047,2:46:04,Lucky123 Thwala,Zuma goes around and mislead student that there is no state capture
1537352600058374,2:46:31,Peet Venter,ALL govt officials should be forced to live in squatter camps. It is the fastest way to improve living conditions.
1537352620442971,2:46:51,sakhile mtshali,I'm yet to hear a sound argument to prove Zuma wrong on his definition of the state
