1554968809805639,10:44,peter pott,now this matter must go back to mogoeng to check if he can't recuse Zondo. haikhona
1554968821154464,10:55,Cerebis,Dawid wellcome! Just be ready for some moronic comments! Best is to ignore them or block them???
1554968825328812,10:59,Gareth Posselt,At least on track.

1554968879737529,11:54,Romeo Shavhani,zondo must recuss himself here
1554968901715781,12:16,Dawid J. Van Huffel,you all globally ... me in NZ
1554968907739391,12:22,peter pott,"mcbride is a real mk comrade, look at the upheaval he just caused this week. lol. just when we thought things are going smoothly"
1554968907745589,12:22,welton paulse,"@Magda Seguin, also true, i am just getting fed up, with family members of high ranking politicians always being involved somehow or somewhere"
1554968911018509,12:25,Magda Seguin,@romeo you are jumping the gun
1554968912482602,12:26,Cerebis,"Jip Magda, I am just waiting to see who will head up that unit!"
1554968926025980,12:40,carnoth ngomane,@Thando Nkutha he chaired one of the disciplinary hearings concerning one of Mcbride's colleague
1554968936882934,12:51,Musa Bakiti,Chair we are all in hot waters.
1554968977086655,13:31,Romeo Shavhani,"no he cant chair this one his must recuse himself, the outcome of this one will be questionable"
1554968978858311,13:33,Magda Seguin,I still have the first book McBride wrote about his imprisonment and being on death row
1554969041473559,14:35,Desmond Masilela,Guys I'm lost. the adv is talking about recuse. Who should recuse himself? We are now going back to a situation like Omotoso or what?
1554969058187918,14:53,Briony French,Zondo Desmond
1554969064187715,14:58,Eslon Eslon,"@romeo shavhani, Now we know why the inquiry's legal team was backtracking with Mcbride appearance here"
1554969071566142,15:05,Sfiso Nkosi,Chief Justice must take over this case
1554969097762489,15:31,peter pott,"@nkosi, you are fully correct"
1554969099318519,15:33,Magda Seguin,@romeo you have not even heard what it is about yet you make judgements...Pretorious is asking now but we don't know the details hence we can't just make judgements
1554969102124623,15:36,Romeo Shavhani,yes but he will only recuse himself only on evidence relating to his brother if he agrees to recuse himself
1554969125655105,16:00,joentsako,the chair..becos McBride is goin to give evidence from an inquiry that was chaired by the DCJ younger brother who's an advocate
1554969126595984,16:01,Dominic Mantana,some are blowing this out of proportion
1554969129735622,16:04,Magda Seguin,@romeo glad you see the light
1554969134679243,16:08,Michael Michael,morning
1554969145842919,16:20,peter pott,"you are wrong Mr pretorius, it is the chief justice role to appoint"
1554969147082662,16:21,welton paulse,I give up
1554969148724228,16:23,carnoth ngomane,@Thando Nkutha you will never know with this people hey
1554969157215990,16:31,Eslon Eslon,"Eish guys, things are becoming tricky now. Zondo has to recuse himself"
1554969171543123,16:45,Wallace Mandimutsira,"those without facts sit down and relax ,listen"
1554969186417537,17:00,Desmond Masilela,Who wants the chair to recuse himself?
1554969197182205,17:11,Jane .Blamire,They are highlighting possibles problems. Very important that this testimony is not challenged later.
1554969206176715,17:20,Vusumzi Ngcoza,"mzansi ubaba ka duduzane, ubuti ka brian now ubhuti ka Mxolisi"
1554969207803130,17:21,Magda Seguin,Please give us the details first before talking about recusal
1554969240652937,17:55,Musa Bakiti,"DCJ don't fight it ,it's the end of the road for now."
1554969250580403,18:04,Desmond Masilela,@Thando Nkutha. Hi Thando
1554969251619308,18:05,peter pott,no option for DCJ but to recuse. how will he subpoena his brother and cross examine him?
1554969253641121,18:07,Sophia Maholela,"Guys are always admiring Miss Molefe, this guy on the Mr Pistorious right is really yummy"
1554969255606202,18:09,Romeo Shavhani,"if Zondo does not recuse himself here, i bet it is going to taint the credibilty of this commission from the beginning till this point"
1554969262522684,18:16,carnoth ngomane,@Thando Nkutha for justice and fairness he should recuse himself only on the part that involves his brother
1554969295960928,18:50,Magda Seguin,He is an investigator NOT a sitting judge in a court of law
1554969317810587,19:12,SP van Zyl,So is Zondo's brother involved in state capture?
1554969357754597,19:52,Magda Seguin,NO he was the lead in the McBride disciplinary
1554969362028033,19:56,joentsako,The brother chaired an inquiry that McBride will mention in his evidence
1554969368176589,20:02,funicanz,"@SP van Zyl , no. His brother chaired one disciplinary hearing against McBride."
1554969374315602,20:08,S Nompozolo,@SP van Zyl implicated yes on McBrides evidence
1554969378277254,20:12,Magda Seguin,I am tired of explaining...just going to listen now
1554969381862734,20:16,peter pott,"shame, it is tough. zondo loves his brother so much. they are presenting him with the problem"
1554969404965168,20:39,welton paulse,seems like family members with corrupt activities are everywhere
1554969407278993,20:41,SP van Zyl,"Ah ok, thanks"
1554969434798880,21:09,Musa Bakiti,No need of the President DCJ .
1554969450169159,21:24,Eslon Eslon,Part of what Mcbride may speak to might make Zondo conflicted bcoz of his brother involvement
1554969455787020,21:30,welton paulse,I am sure that other Zondo guy works for Ace
1554969461127931,21:35,Jane .Blamire,Welton you are missing the point
1554969504791061,22:19,welton paulse,"@Jane .Blamire , please help me see, understand and respect that point comrade"
1554969528589131,22:42,peter pott,"this is what happens when you set up a commission to catch on person, namely Zuma. now out of it there are many casualties"
1554969529123509,22:43,Magda Seguin,@Jane everybody jumps to conclusions on this thread...no discernment
1554969544153026,22:58,Eslon Eslon,Shame the chair is caught between the rock and the hard
1554969551938934,23:06,peter pott,call chief justice Mogoeng DCJ
1554969554967182,23:10,Dominic Mantana,true Magda
1554969592190987,23:46,Sfiso Nkosi,"So, Zondo doesn't have a deputy?"
1554969600374600,23:54,Magda Seguin,This commission is absolutely necessary...we would have carried on wondering why the country is bankrupt
1554969620388625,24:14,Musa Bakiti,"Thank you Jesus ,Zuma and sons are not the only ones corrupt."
1554969625873784,24:20,Jane .Blamire,Both Zondos are lawyers/judges chairing inquiries. Conflict of both inquiries have same witness. This is just a legal issue to make sure all done correctly
1554969671384140,25:05,Sfiso Nkosi,"this was the downfall, no man is an island. Chief justice must jump in for this sitting. for the sake of fairness"
1554969672260639,25:06,Magda Seguin,Thanks Jane you are correct
1554969680076319,25:14,welton paulse,"I feel sorry for Zondo, coz just as he is trying to assist us to destroy corruption, just so are there people trying to discredit this credible person"
1554969682430681,25:16,Jane .Blamire,Agree Magda. People must listen first before jumping to conclusions
1554969724850834,25:59,peter pott,"we wasted 6 weeks of mcbride evidence. we the looks of things, we are also looking at another"
1554969731032878,26:05,Eslon Eslon,"Guys this is a no easy matter, bcoz if Zondo continues lawyers of other implicated persons will take up issues with this matter"
1554969748940026,26:23,Dominic Mantana,Zondo Jrr happened to be a chairperson of disciplinary inquiry.
1554969754402890,26:28,Jane .Blamire,Agree Eslon. Very tricky
1554969765778192,26:40,Magda Seguin,All this is due to ANC factionalism.The top six are divided and give out conflicting statements on a daily basis
1554969776932700,26:51,Sfiso Nkosi,Zondo must just listen and give the Chief Justice or public protector to make a decision
1554969800246009,27:14,Wayward,public protector?
1554969816116956,27:30,Robert Russell,Ok so what do want to know Michael üòÉ
1554969828860033,27:43,Sfiso Nkosi,"the show must go on, no more dalay"
1554969884327361,28:38,Dominic Mantana,Non of the people involved objected or requested for the recusal of Zondo snr
1554969887221196,28:41,Musa Bakiti,Pretorius won't agree
1554969894438251,28:48,Magda Seguin,Read Gangster State...Ace corrupted everybody...he wants eventually to be President
1554969915589234,29:09,Eslon Eslon,"Jane. Blamire... Very much, and you know how lawyers operates, they will use this loophole"
1554969927480567,29:21,Desmond Masilela,We have wasted lot of time with all this postponement. let the commission carry on.
1554969937441233,29:31,welton paulse,"@Jane .Blamire , This commission was established by the government. Yet Ace said he is not taking it serious, while Mantashe said he takes it serious. Now imagine what people like Ace would say now"
1554969940640354,29:34,peter pott,"@mantana, it's a trap. they want to have something to hold on later"
1554969981811887,30:15,Dominic Mantana,Zondo jrr is not intending to appear before the commission nor seek to cross examine Mc Bride
1554969986120548,30:20,Jane .Blamire,Pretorius making absolutely that there are NO loopholes to protect this testimony
1554970004975441,30:39,Mr Jones Parker,THe legal team knew about this. Why didnt they raise then?
1554970020993744,30:55,Magda Seguin,@Dominic...correct
1554970029003215,31:03,Thulani Bukani,Legal team is a bit disappointing
1554970037494091,31:11,Desmond Masilela,I knew about that postponement on Monday that it will come with some other stories.
1554970039093776,31:13,Jane .Blamire,They are now in public.
1554970058640274,31:32,peter pott,"@seguin,Ace followers only read sesotho books. they stay far from English one's. they listen to him speaking to them in vernacular. book is not far reaching"
1554970076566081,31:50,Jane .Blamire,This testimony must be VERY important with all this fuss!!!
1554970076707405,31:51,Magda Seguin,who knows if the legal team are not being spooked...they are everywhere
1554970077930241,31:52,Sfiso Nkosi,But this should have been dealt with long before we come on air.
1554970080619143,31:54,Musa Bakiti,we cannot proceed
1554970082011749,31:56,Eslon Eslon,That's why I said the other day that there's something about Mcbride's appearance here
1554970103816121,32:18,welton paulse,"@magda,"
1554970110746341,32:25,Magda Seguin,@Sfiso...The public must also be informed...joining the dots

1554970200486731,33:54,Dominic Mantana,Nevertheless Pretorious states aspects of law which governs recusal or non recusal thereof.
1554970201319237,33:55,peter pott,"@nxumalo, this period is paradise for Advocates to make money"

1554970243098296,34:37,Romeo Shavhani,he drinks water
1554970251532249,34:46,welton paulse,The legal team is not very pro active but rather reactive
1554970252287162,34:47,Dr Matome Moloto TV,"i came late , what seems to be the problem"
1554970270998938,35:05,Desmond Masilela,Who is Ngcukayitobi presenting?

1554970309140433,35:43,Magda Seguin,@peter pott and ATM is making inroads in by elections..Big surprise but no so big knowing that their electioneering are in churches
1554970320343972,35:54,welton paulse,"@Jane .Blamire, i disagree, Macbreezie have been here twice, but because the legal team failed to do what they ought to have done. it got postponed"

1554972976661304,1:20:11,Auti Mjita,"@Dumile Mateza His handlers had 25 years to go after colonial/apartheid criminals, instead they chose to eat with WMC no less...and now the brain dead voting fodder expects us to believe there's..."
1554973006141262,1:20:40,Jack Sparrow,WMC!!!!!!!
1554973011979970,1:20:46,Auti Mjita,"...some injustice against 'blacks' in general...I feel victimized by the BLACK ANC, AS A BLACK MAN"
1554973023003119,1:20:57,Uncle Funk,Holy Crap. NPA did nothing!
1554973044145386,1:21:18,Dumile Mateza,We shoild not believe any of the trite that is peddled by the likes Aubrey and Malema about the removal of Cyril. After the elections the SG and his deputy could be removed at the NGC
1554973059520424,1:21:33,Magda Seguin,WMC is a Bell Pottinger/Gupta invention..please stop using it!
1554973062354870,1:21:36,Biza330,Wowüòì
1554973068093518,1:21:42,Mzalwane Mzala,Stop these Julius Malema lies about the removal of Cyril. The ANC NEC has no power of removing an elected ANC president
1554973080062234,1:21:54,ayanda ndaba,the cracks and factions within the ANC seem to have begun long long before the release of Mandela ...and most probably there were differences in ideology and strategy from way way back.
1554973080112611,1:21:54,ALPHEUS SEKGALA,At what time is McBride going to speak?
1554973127453757,1:22:42,Starsky Hudge,Who is making sounds like a Hippo lol!!

1554973167164075,1:23:21,Mzalwane Mzala,@Uncle Funk The ANC has a constitution.
1554973168391788,1:23:22,Magda Seguin,@ayanda correct...those who were in exile and those who remained in the country was already at loggerheads
1554973174560754,1:23:28,Eslon Eslon,l'm already worried that lawyers of implicated persons might come back and technically say Mcbride evidence must dismissed bcoz the Zondo is conflicted of his brother's involvement in another inquiry
1554973175054227,1:23:29,Danie Nilsen,yes in a moment pretoirus los die lip flappery en laat mc bride op die stand en jy moet jou fecluse jy is bais teenoor mc bride
1554973177042940,1:23:30,Dumile Mateza,@Mzwalane Mzala Cyril would have one the ANC near two thirds majority and his arm will bw strengthened and his detractors will be removed both as cabinet ministers and position of influence.
