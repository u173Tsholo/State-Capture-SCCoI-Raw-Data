1600677898002907,25:35,Blake Yogi,Because Zuma is the one we wanna hear. He is the one who must answer many unanswered questions and been implicated by many witnesses. He needs answers. Pravin will have his turn
1600677898029803,25:36,Carmen James,@bekithemba masa . Is Gordhan the accused or is his evidence being cross examined?

1600678074211719,28:31,bekithemba masa,"the double standards just to get at Zuma are amazing ,and funny that other pple dont see anything wrong coz it serves the agenda of Thuli"
1600678085731152,28:43,Kgotso Mpete,"@Mfundo absolutely, remember that when the contractors are hand picked, they already know the owners of the contractor companies 😂😂😂"
1600678103684573,29:01,Blake Yogi,Its prioritizing.

1600678115011058,29:12,Fredy Pummer,Just to clarify that Showerhead will have to confirm that he will appear from 16-20 October 2020. If he doesn't then Zondo will proceed with a summons on 9th October
1600678130488125,29:27,Blake Yogi,"Nobody said Pravin wont come again, his time just aint now."
1600678142920561,29:41,Mfundo,"Kgotso Mpete, oh wow but m sure it is no longer done that way neh?"
1600678144911634,29:43,bekithemba masa,"if Zondo is practising such double standards, it will make this commission more useless as it's already been so far , he was boiling over Pravin but did nothing"

1600678251225451,31:29,Kgotso Mpete,@Mfundo Maybe now they are not doing so because investigations are making them not to sleep at night😂😂😂
1600678255486785,31:33,cassim suleman,but using eff mentality
1600678274576738,31:52,Blake Yogi,"Only Zumas fans and lovers will think its unfair that he doesnt come. Justice, on the other hand, has spoken and even thinking against that, is a sign of corruption"

1600678401209707,33:59,Thobani Mkananda,@Freddy Pummer Was he not originally scheduled to appear this week? Instead of appearing he urgently sent a letter through his attorneys putting forward lofty reasons?

1600680821022479,1:14:18,keith francis,arms scandal companies already prosecuted overseas years ago. Those countries prepared to give over info but our NPA is very laid back or lack of political will to tackle comrades
1600680833633892,1:14:32,bekithemba masa,"Andre that's what we want Ramaphosa to tell us ,how he missed that , it's a confirmed fact that he was tasked to manage SOEs , if there was any corruption Cyril should have blown the whistle"

1600680977150103,1:16:55,Andre Gerber,I don't agree masa. then Zuma should not have gotten involved. Evidence leads to then Pres not V Pres
1600681060825251,1:18:19,bekithemba masa,"the problem in SA is that certain corruption scandals must be attributed to Zuma alone yet the involvement of many others is deliberately ignored , thats why cases go nowhere like VBS & Arms Deal"
1600681065912704,1:18:23,Blake Yogi,@Andre. You are wasting your precious energy. That is a superfan you wont get anything right there

1600685192626320,2:27:10,Thobani Mkananda,@Andre Gerber There's a case that the CC will hand down a ruling on in due course. The ANC is deeming coalition gov unworkable due to undue absence of its councillors in the council of Tshwane

1600685451379757,2:31:28,Thobani Mkananda,@Andre Gerber Exactly they are determined to undermine coalition governance. What was interesting in those proceedings at the CC was they were not available to make submissions. What was that about?
