1595855040794055,4:55:41,Zakhele Tshabalala,HOW CAN U HAVE A STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY WHILE UR STILL CAPTURED
1595855063338253,4:56:04,Melusi Sikakane,@Olufemi Ijalana because there is no state capture
1595855078395361,4:56:19,Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi,"PW Botha was a President with only matric as well, he was a university drop out..."

1595855290072451,4:59:51,Dominic Przybylski,PW Botha and Ramaphosa seem to be very similar. Botha didn't have the courage to cross the Rubicon and Ramaphosa doesn't have the courage to make a similar break with the past.
1595855365848364,5:01:06,Edward Baloyi,@mfundo Veerasamy this one of 500 billion will be the biggest loot that ever happened in the world
1595855371322381,5:01:11,Melusi Sikakane,@Dominic Przybylski your education assertion is empty

1595855523234050,5:03:43,Pops Rampersad,"@Skhumbuzo, you are now trying to control my freedom of speech which is guaranteed in our Constitution"
1595855523768352,5:03:43,Dominic Przybylski,@Melusi Sikakane If my assertion is empty then it means that state capture was not due to JZ's ignorance but was premeditated. I imagine this commission will answer that at the very least.
1595855576206945,5:04:36,Joseph Gumede,kusele kancane ukut

1595855862159734,5:09:23,Melusi Sikakane,@Dominic Przybylski . You read too much newspapar. Some said Zuma will run to Dubai but he is still here. Even Jamnands when questioned by Christian Amnpour CNN changed his statement. Zuma haters
1595855959687234,5:11:00,Pops Rampersad,"@Skhumbuzo, point taken brother. Just for clarity, that person has a matric certificate."
1595855986090486,5:11:26,Dominic Przybylski,@Melusi Sikakane Nothing to do with too much reading. Either JZ allowed state capture through ignorance and incompetence or he planned and executed it. What other alternative is there?

1595864693822504,7:35:46,Singi Mathebula,he will not look at you chair because he is aware that you will read his lies
1595864703793267,7:35:56,Eliot Chauke,Zondo hates those who are associated with Zuma. and he love the CR17 gang
1595864778057053,7:37:10,Dominic Przybylski,@Henry Chauke The only way to remove them is via the ballot box. That's highly unlikely so we'll just have to accept that we get the government the majority continues to vote into power.
