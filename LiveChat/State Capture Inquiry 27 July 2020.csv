1595855025846963,4:55:27,Dominic Przybylski,"@Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi We had a president in charge of the whole of government with virtually no formal education, and we are surprised that he was fooled by every other conman. Democracy can be scary."
1595855035968932,4:55:36,pule tsotetsi,The person coughing should leave the room
1595855040794055,4:55:41,Zakhele Tshabalala,HOW CAN U HAVE A STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY WHILE UR STILL CAPTURED
1595855063338253,4:56:04,Melusi Sikakane,@Olufemi Ijalana because there is no state capture
1595855078395361,4:56:19,Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi,"PW Botha was a President with only matric as well, he was a university drop out..."
1595855108436952,4:56:49,Arian Bester,we are in 2

1595855225849961,4:58:47,Pops Rampersad,"@Skhumbuzo, for your info the person whom you are referring to has a matric certificate and is a person with unquestionable integrity"
1595855227007687,4:58:48,Mfundo,there is another Commission coming covid-19 corruption of enquiry walala banana republic

1595855265547600,4:59:26,Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi,"Pops, who had integrity?"
1595855290072451,4:59:51,Dominic Przybylski,PW Botha and Ramaphosa seem to be very similar. Botha didn't have the courage to cross the Rubicon and Ramaphosa doesn't have the courage to make a similar break with the past.
1595855365848364,5:01:06,Edward Baloyi,@mfundo Veerasamy this one of 500 billion will be the biggest loot that ever happened in the world
1595855371322381,5:01:11,Melusi Sikakane,@Dominic Przybylski your education assertion is empty
1595855387565886,5:01:28,Pops Rampersad,"@Skhumbuzo, the Acting SARS Commissioner whom you referred to as not having a matric certificate"
1595855468353166,5:02:49,Joseph Gumede,uzomelwa inhliziyo lobaba
1595855472901541,5:02:53,Mfundo,@Edward Baloyi the likes of Daily Maverick are trying by all means to sweep this under carpet and they control the media
1595855499820487,5:03:21,Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi,"Pops, as I said, let's refrain talking about integrity, I worked with all the people I'm referring to, I'm not just dropping names for the sake of seeking relevance."
1595855523234050,5:03:43,Pops Rampersad,"@Skhumbuzo, you are now trying to control my freedom of speech which is guaranteed in our Constitution"
1595855523768352,5:03:43,Dominic Przybylski,@Melusi Sikakane If my assertion is empty then it means that state capture was not due to JZ's ignorance but was premeditated. I imagine this commission will answer that at the very least.
1595855576206945,5:04:36,Joseph Gumede,kusele kancane ukut
1595855596271848,5:04:55,Melusi Sikakane,"It is so funny that he is being asked about why he hired so and so, but who is asking why pravin is hiring only whites at soes"
1595855611043598,5:05:12,Pops Rampersad,"@Skhumbuzo, I'm qualified to comment. I know this Cde personally."

1595855702691101,5:06:45,Pops Rampersad,"@Melusi, it's because Nathi Nhleko is appearing now before the Zondo Commission and not another person"
1595855726064214,5:07:06,makhosi nobhatyi,Where in the world people stole money and crime nothing happened only you find here state is paralyzed crippled nothing is happening
1595855833672824,5:08:53,Pops Rampersad,"@Skhumbuzu, cautioning me against what? Just as you are commenting, so am I. It's for anyone who reads these comments to agree or not."

1595855860330010,5:09:21,Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi,"Pops, let me bow out from this debate as I don't see where it's taking us, I was making an example to show that qualifications aren't always necessary in political appointments, that's all."
1595855862159734,5:09:23,Melusi Sikakane,@Dominic Przybylski . You read too much newspapar. Some said Zuma will run to Dubai but he is still here. Even Jamnands when questioned by Christian Amnpour CNN changed his statement. Zuma haters
1595855959687234,5:11:00,Pops Rampersad,"@Skhumbuzo, point taken brother. Just for clarity, that person has a matric certificate."
1595855986090486,5:11:26,Dominic Przybylski,@Melusi Sikakane Nothing to do with too much reading. Either JZ allowed state capture through ignorance and incompetence or he planned and executed it. What other alternative is there?
1595856000225766,5:11:41,Nicky majiya,Ayipheli lendaba kude kkubanjwe bani?

1595857363526310,5:34:24,Sipho Mnqayi,That there is a major problem for me because it proves the conspiracy theory that someone else is running the country
1595857371656287,5:34:32,HBWorx,Corruption by WMC is not criminal
1595857418485033,5:35:19,Thug Life,communism is absolute corruption
1595857457302378,5:35:57,HBWorx,Somebody is controling the state behind the curtains and its Cyril's buddies ...

1595857513673685,5:36:54,Dominic Przybylski,Corruption in government is more serious than in private sector because government forces people to pay tax while private sector needs to convince people to pay voluntarily.
1595857542569401,5:37:23,Danie Nilsen,capitilism is to look where you come from and what you wear drive eat drink and who you acasotiate with like horse racing kentucky adiction guci shoes berlinger watches v8 mercedes and bmw vehecles
1595857595484800,5:38:16,Thug Life,"capitalism you can decide to be your own person, and grind your way out of poverty"
1595857596870610,5:38:17,Dominic Przybylski,In private sector we have a choice whether we accept dealing with a company. In public sector we don't have a choice. That's why corruption in public sector is so serious.

1595857753197916,5:40:54,Sipho Mnqayi,Thank you for that
1595857786658755,5:41:27,Dominic Przybylski,If government is corrupt and tries to play a dominant role in the economy then corruption will dominate. The economy will become rotten. Oh it already has!

1595858552164302,5:54:14,Dominic Przybylski,Will be interesting to see how many companies are prepared to deal with a government/SOEs which cannot pay their suppliers. We will end up with two separate economies.

1595864171982280,7:27:04,Alvino Theunissen,He plays he don't know or can't recall but all a plot from his lawyers and him but taking the Judge and commission for a ride prove their points
1595864172337704,7:27:04,Dominic Przybylski,"He was not paid to think. That was the ""reference group's"" job."
1595864271626578,7:28:45,Singi Mathebula,does this zuma group get couched in one room?
1595864272303133,7:28:46,Val Speirs,surely a docket must be complete to suspend or reccomend suspensions.?!
1595864303810018,7:29:16,Singi Mathebula,there nothing the know or remember.
1595864497205905,7:32:28,Singi Mathebula,arrogance
1595864537965980,7:33:10,Mr A,"Liars recall nothing, remember nothing & not sure of anything. Lawyers know this tactic."
1595864552870618,7:33:25,Dominic Przybylski,Was he drunk or what? Why does he have such overwhelming amnesia about something which was extremely significant during his tenure?
1595864626536002,7:34:38,Henry Chauke,"Our country is a corrupt state. it will remain like this for years, unless they able to remove corrupt people IN ANC , TO SAVE OUR MOVEMENT."
1595864649749496,7:35:02,Mr A,Is avoiding implicating himself but the Judge will make inferences in his findings.
1595864693822504,7:35:46,Singi Mathebula,he will not look at you chair because he is aware that you will read his lies
1595864703793267,7:35:56,Eliot Chauke,Zondo hates those who are associated with Zuma. and he love the CR17 gang
1595864778057053,7:37:10,Dominic Przybylski,@Henry Chauke The only way to remove them is via the ballot box. That's highly unlikely so we'll just have to accept that we get the government the majority continues to vote into power.
1595864804889396,7:37:38,Singi Mathebula,eeeeh!@Eliot Chauke. but zondo has not said anything in the past ten or so minutes
1595864826374852,7:37:57,Henry Chauke,"ELIOT ,Zondo is not bias but strategic to allow the flow of questioning them and make them feel free , those who are doing law understand what i mean...."
1595864844841335,7:38:17,Eliot Chauke,@singi come on.
1595864862934875,7:38:35,Mandy Phillips,wonder how Zondo is biased....

1595864911497225,7:39:24,Singi Mathebula,"this one is a danda head, he can't follow simple instructions, adress the chair😰😨"
1595864956767463,7:40:08,Eliot Chauke,im saying he is biased cos last week he was angry whn Judge Tintswalo asked fr postponement. today Mcbride was also absent and asked fr postponement... Zondo was calm and happy to grant it
1595864958243008,7:40:10,Anthony Ramasike,his mind is presently wondering
1595864965059279,7:40:17,Singi Mathebula,it's a fact@elliot Chauke.
1595865040322987,7:41:32,MIKE DURBAN,He probably thinks he's ....untouchable.......
1595865111963454,7:42:43,Singi Mathebula,but Nhleko is before the commission as planned. makhubele failed to inform the chair of her unavailability on time. that is being disrespectful.
1595865120120160,7:42:53,Pinky Gumede,I agree with you Elliot. He requested that she be phoned
1595865156812199,7:43:29,Dominic Przybylski,"""I employ consultants to apply my minds for me,"" is what is probably going through his mind."
1595865165952388,7:43:38,Henry Chauke,"you are correct Eliot, He was angry and end up saying bcs she is part of them, who knows law and a judge for that matter"
1595865185931735,7:43:59,Pinky Gumede,besides the point. Nhleko is here but does not remember anything
1595865194990361,7:44:07,Singi Mathebula,😂😂😂😂@Dominic
1595865206628458,7:44:19,Eliot Chauke,"@Singi McBride was not present, his lawyer asked fr postponement. everything went smoothly."
1595865272691014,7:45:25,Eliot Chauke,@henry Chauke no he was angry because she is not part of CR17 gang
1595865282427060,7:45:35,MIKE DURBAN,Nail him..CJ...
1595865351842190,7:46:43,Singi Mathebula,Nana makhubele is a sitting judge. . she must lead by example. what would be her response if it was in her court?
1595865425586943,7:47:58,Eliot Chauke,Chairperson must treat witness equally
1595865426439454,7:47:59,Anthony Ramasike,that one will see sparks flying...we are waiting for her at the commision
1595865450073746,7:48:22,Roy Kisten,this guy has a lot of nits and lice on he's head
