1575450047740498,1:55:41,Jacqui Baumgardt,@Lucky123 Thwala - he only questions liars
1575450059791468,1:55:53,Derek Main,Chabi seems like a very smart guy. Someone he Hawks could use to delve into corporate corruption.
1575450078198132,1:56:11,Jacqui Baumgardt,@Derek Main - agree
1575450192705619,1:58:06,Pastor J.J,We should be proud as a Nation that we are developing and have in our midst such amazing talent as we see in Alister Chabi. We need to encourage and support more Alister's.

1575451401723259,2:18:14,mandisi ntauzana,NPV of this will lower........ This bid was in shumbles
1575451439635799,2:18:52,SAM STORIES,@ Brendan they did have 'something' hence they got those tenders. That 'something' was connections
