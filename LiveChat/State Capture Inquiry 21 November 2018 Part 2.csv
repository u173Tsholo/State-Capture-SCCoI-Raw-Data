1542806927691094,1:25:16,dave east,patriarchs control land money and jobs . what do south african black men control for black women to fight us for?
1542806939861646,1:25:29,Sthakathi Khumalo,Sam Vanguard but that is wrong though. We want to participate in the economy when we seek land for shelter and sustain a living among other things

1542806988173086,1:26:17,lee royal,"@em D THE MINORITY OWN SO MUCH LAND, MONEY COMES AND GOES WE NEED LEGACY OUR PEOPLE CANT KEEP GOING FOR INTERVIEWS AT WHITE OWNED COMPANIES"
1542807004263111,1:26:32,Sam Vanguard,@noko yamebetlwa ok then from your perspective hahaha
1542807031621167,1:27:00,Danie Nilsen,Noko it is true that there are knowlegeable black farmers but are there any money lenders who are prepared to lend them as the goverment are just helping themselves and loot the bank who are supposed
1542807042049707,1:27:10,Sam Vanguard,play with private property you will become zimbabwe and wallow in poverty

1542807089678795,1:27:59,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,@lee royal I agree with my leadership. But today lets focus on this one because its also very important.
1542807091677110,1:28:01,Sam Vanguard,black south africans should be clever not to take heed this expropiation bullcrap we all know who will suffer
1542807103989242,1:28:13,Sthakathi Khumalo,Was he fired or did he resign??
1542807122940512,1:28:31,dave east,guys its a serious question. if we ss men dont control anything why would our women be joining femenist groups to fight for womens groups but not for pan Africanism
1542807131956486,1:28:41,Singi Mathebula,we must learn to be patience because farming is not predictable. it's not like getting a tender today and get paid tomorrow even though the site establishment has not been identified.
1542807132711065,1:28:41,Blaze 613,poopoo time
1542807139797570,1:28:49,Showdown,Lunch????

1542807145539501,1:28:55,Fick Liebenberg,That is true @Noko in the past and now there is a lot of black people working very hard on farms they don't own.
1542807175513645,1:29:24,dave east,it makes no sense
1542807176937723,1:29:25,Sam Vanguard,@noko yamebetlwa come to m farm and i will show you what is farming
