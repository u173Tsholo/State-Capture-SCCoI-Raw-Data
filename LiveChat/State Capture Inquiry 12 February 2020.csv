1581498560238408,1:07:52,Person of interest,BEE laws should have been changed long ago. Ms Memela is clever enough to know for a fact that it wasn't her fault that her house got paid for out of this beautiful Bee system through DTI!!!

1581498869219681,1:13:02,Umar Singh,Should politicians and all levels of goverrment and SOE officials attend weekly church/religous services once a week and practice what is preached to improve their moral behaviour.
1581498876187418,1:13:08,Derek Main,@Kung Fu Kenny My take is that apartheid officially started in 1948 with the Nats coming to power. Legislated segregation and subjugation.
1581498913864553,1:13:46,Rory Pro,Mrs Hoffmeyr is also losing her cool... getting interesting! 😃
1581498915496216,1:13:48,Fana Nkosi,why did whites vote national party cause they approved apartheid

1581498941005481,1:14:13,Derek Main,@Kung Fu Kenny The colonisers (Dutch & British) had already subjugated the local population and they were consider sub-human.

1581499020966177,1:15:33,Kung Fu Kenny,Xhosa and Zulu's literally sold their own people to the Brits so they can sell the Xhosa and Zulu people to the U.S as slaves. Did they teach you that in history class?
1581499025150815,1:15:37,Craig Johnson,And BEE benefits blacks

1581499070355833,1:16:22,Derek Main,@Craig Johnson Of course - blacks were historically locked out of the economy. That is why some form of BEE is necessary.

1581499421280783,1:22:14,mandisi ntauzana,Adv Hoffmeyr is struggling........ Why is Adv Memela being asked on questions relating to Board decisions when she was not part of the board? She is being asked unfair questions
1581499456723363,1:22:48,digitalemotionfilms,She is being asked question relating to her statement she gave
1581499461948153,1:22:54,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski I put it to you that that has more to do with the greed of capitalism than with BEE.
1581499465040690,1:22:57,digitalemotionfilms,mandisi ntauzana She is being asked question relating to her statement she gave
1581499482926957,1:23:16,Hennie Cloete,@Dominic Przybylski-so true

1581499491397394,1:23:23,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@mandisi ntauzana not if i listen to Chair Zondo
1581499502523477,1:23:36,Kung Fu Kenny,@Derek Main Even normal black people agree in the US the BEE (Affirmative action) kills the economy.
1581499546584286,1:24:20,Maryann Diamond,-@mandisi that is exactly why she is asking Mamela cuz she had her 2c in the board and she made decisions in the board as well if u listened yesterday she was part of some meetings
1581499584796686,1:24:57,Maryann Diamond,amen Norman !!!!

1581499636147184,1:25:48,mandisi ntauzana,@Nyasha Mudyiwa my brother please note that the HOD of Procurement does not sit in the board where the decision of the parts tender was made. She is HOD correct leading a specific department
1581499676892405,1:26:30,Anne M.,Where does the board get it's information from in order to make a decision? From the HOD.
1581499688753036,1:26:41,Maryann Diamond,@mandisi scroll up read my comment then ull understand
1581499703339833,1:26:55,Wildthing,Mandisi yesterday it was made clear she was in the boardroom for the board meetings.

1581499832720518,1:29:05,mandisi ntauzana,@Anne M. me and you both agree but the questions relating to the Board of Directors decision to award the tender to JM and not AirFrance are unfair as Adv Memela is not a board member of SAAT
1581499838956004,1:29:11,Maryann Diamond,@mandisi ... ur comment proves my point that why we are where we are .. dont pick and choose what ull listen to..
1581499853608492,1:29:25,Werner Opperman,Sometimes it seems as if the judge wants to get witness to see certain things. They should just give their version and be held to it later if it was found to be false. Much time will be saved that way

1581500019696132,1:32:12,Anne M.,"@mandisi ntauzana Ms Memela did not want to come to the commission, even after certain allegations were made against her by the director of JM. Ms Mamela even spoke about ignoring the subpoena."

1581500125663868,1:33:58,mandisi ntauzana,@Anne M. that was her decision and for her to be present to the hearing for the past week is also her decision. Has nothing of being part of the board that b=took decision
1581500138268303,1:34:10,Wildthing,Mandisi try explain to all the people how a stranger gives someone 2.5 million for a deposit on a house.

1581500241454206,1:35:54,Norman Zwane,@mandisi ntauzana Factually you are incorrect. She planned not to attend until DCJ publicly reminded her it was not an invitation but a subp
1581500252248558,1:36:05,Anne M.,"@mandisi ntauzana The board decision is one small part in the total evidence. If you are issued with a subpoena, it's no longer your decision to attend. Ignore and you get arrested."

1581500292084732,1:36:44,Wildthing,True where the Tax records. Mandisi as a CEO on a consultancy how does that work. do you need to declare the Tax of 2.5 Mil that was used to buy a house.

1581501073980677,1:49:45,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Phillip Cwazibe Also the reason why most businesses crash down fast, the ""Partner"" adds no equity like you said."
1581501090490127,1:50:02,Joe da silva,She’s going to faint in 5 minuets
1581501109469133,1:50:21,Derek Main,@Kung Fu Kenny I support the principle of BEE not the current law or implementation. Capeesh?
1581501112397758,1:50:25,Kung Fu Kenny,@Derek Main The current form of BEE is exactly the same just a few of their policies changed to loot further.
1581501129979233,1:50:42,Gareth Hellyar,DOA. Dead on arrival.
1581501143291377,1:50:56,Joe da silva,Lol

1581501166451480,1:51:19,Maryann Diamond,"@mandisi , is mamela innocent or guilty ?"
1581501186629798,1:51:39,Derek Main,@Kung Fu Kenny Because of past injustices and current inequalities. Suimple.
1581501191931102,1:51:44,Phillip Cwazibe,"@ Kung Fu Kenny ​ while not contributing equity, the partners goes window shopping for cars but will not go to VW. Sundays at golf estates viewing show houses."

1581501236239358,1:52:29,Dominic Przybylski,BEE is effectively an extra tax more than double company tax and we wonder why we get so little foreign investment or why Anglo American has move everything out they do out of the country.
1581501239893384,1:52:33,Wildthing,ha ha
1581501251471970,1:52:44,Lesego Nthiza,"she is evasive, I doubt her."

1581501284296672,1:53:15,Dominic Przybylski,No surprise we have such high unemployment.
1581501286083936,1:53:17,Kung Fu Kenny,@Derek Main The principle and the structure of BEE should not be supported.
1581501288710834,1:53:21,Rob Nel,This should be interesting
1581501291139797,1:53:24,Shephered Moyo,Crisp answers
1581501292896823,1:53:25,Derrick Paul,"innocent till proven guilty - what a farce, so in other words you can steal till you get caught. and if you delay and run from the process of court you remain innocent?"

1581501343706413,1:54:15,digitalemotionfilms,Thamsanqa Nomayela unless you give a statement under oath like this lady did and then change your version as you go along. Thats called perjury

1581501366694123,1:54:39,Hennie Cloete,@Kung Fu Kenny- I fully agree with you but the BEE scorecard is forcing corporates into bad business practises like paying more for a service that reality!
1581501375318739,1:54:47,Jacqui Baumgardt,@digitalemotionfilms - she needs to be disbarred as an advocate
1581501378201103,1:54:51,Derek Main,@Kung Fu Kenny So just pretend apartheid never happened?
1581501400028115,1:55:12,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Derek Main Apartheid did happen, should we pretend the current crime rate isn't happening or the current looting?"
1581501408628112,1:55:20,thulani fadashe,So the likes of AirFrance were also taking advantage of SAA.
1581501414766950,1:55:27,Thamsanqa Nomayela,to convict these people on average need at least 7 years.
