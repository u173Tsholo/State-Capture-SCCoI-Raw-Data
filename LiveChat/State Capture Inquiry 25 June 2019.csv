1561450677516554,11:06,Derek Main,@Anne M. I thought the rule that has been applied thus far is that you cannot cross-examine witnesses until you have testified yourself.
1561450682136174,11:11,Mduduzi Thabede,From there
1561450722042969,11:51,Derek Main,@Granny Mokwena #ProudlyBroughtToYouByTheANC

1561450780809512,12:49,Felix Muyoba,very very boring..
1561450823142011,13:31,Mduduzi Thabede,You may cross examine but you must have submitted your own version in the form of an affidavit
1561450886988075,14:35,Jayden Bango,Zondo has more questions for Adv than the witness loooooooool
1561450912260138,15:01,Mduduzi Thabede,ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

1561451241446692,20:29,Derek Main,@Mduduzi Thabede Aaah OK - thanks.
1561451316847044,21:45,Derek Main,@Mduduzi Thabede It's going to have to be a very long affidavit.
1561451338053041,22:07,Mduduzi Thabede,ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
1561451348629080,22:17,Mduduzi Thabede,Absolutely
1561451681824712,27:49,Jayden Bango,but is that fuel for the whole Tambo fleet or just for two in question....this is not clear
1561451786850475,29:35,Diana Sekatane,"the Nigerian President is reserving jobs for them at home, therefore they should go home and get employment."
1561452094750984,34:43,Jayden Bango,she must be able to stand on her own feet the commission does not want to waste resources
1561452187773408,36:16,Wildthing,where did the Guptas.park there airplane and where did it get refilled.
1561452240052161,37:08,Robert Russell,It got chased to OR @Michael Wild
1561452298131318,38:06,Jayden Bango,morning michael
1561452406657203,39:55,Diana Sekatane,@wild the aircraft landed at Lanseria if not mistaken.
1561452453155511,40:41,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Robert Russell People will say you're xeno...
1561452470617276,40:59,Hermiomie Asreal,"to my knowledge, it landed at Waterkloof Air Base, hence the outrage"
1561452514086144,41:42,Diana Sekatane,oh yes you are right
1561452576069223,42:44,Robert Russell,"@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU .... read the old testament.... """"Eye for a eye"""" call me what you like."
1561452612039476,43:21,Wildthing,The plane they used for business that was grounded by the Canadian company. it was used by Zuma and others to travel to Dubai. but guess Lanseria was a better located site. but was fuel diverted
1561452710764978,44:59,hilton modike,ya neh
1561452711838102,45:00,Hermiomie Asreal,I wonder whose job it is to prepare all this paperwork...
1561452796024532,46:25,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Robert Russell But i always found it hypocritical when any citizens complain about Nigerians on drugs, being labeled as xeno. Its a reality and i see them quite often in Townships. Come on!"
1561452832213934,47:00,Peet Venter,Chairman is correct. It is frustrating that the evidence leader dies not allow the witness to tell the story behind the facts and only reference the facts when necessary.
1561452929403294,48:38,Jayden Bango,"the whole thing is flat, no punch, and yet it contains some crucial materil"
1561453021413662,50:10,Peet Venter,This is better...
1561453059458396,50:48,Diana Sekatane,patience when you punch the body the head will eventually give in.
1561453163998995,52:32,Nelson Musoliwa,Zuma's lawyers are accusing the Zondo comm of impartiality a grave concern according to me and is vague on whether he will appear on the set dates before the comm
1561453303300084,54:52,Jayden Bango,Zuma carries too much baggage his cross exam requires mmore than a week
1561453355536478,55:43,Nelson Musoliwa,Interesting to see how the Zondo cmm will respond to Zuma's letter on how he view the comm among others that the comm is prejudiced against him.
1561453388366744,56:16,Hermiomie Asreal,I saw an EWN report this morning saying he was heeding the call to appear at the commision
1561453420123773,56:48,Robert Russell,Always the VICTIM @Nelson Musoliwa
1561453425345579,56:54,Jayden Bango,"IMHO, to allow Zuma to testify here is just a waste of time. He must have his day at the courts"
1561453493043493,58:01,Nelson Musoliwa,Jayden you are right a week is not enough
1561453593681989,59:42,Hermiomie Asreal,"He needs to face reality, he is a proponent in state capture and I fear that he might flee or die before going to prison."
1561453645588450,1:00:34,Nelson Musoliwa,Zuma always play smart with law crying victim hood
1561453842892363,1:03:51,Joseph Gumede,"waits of time no one will be arrestesd at the end, the state still playing tax money from end of aparthead billions moved to overseas by whites minority Gov."
1561453956154943,1:05:45,Romano Sparks,Too much
1561454070311353,1:07:38,Slindile Ngcobo,"""I will kill for Zuma"""
1561454112849335,1:08:22,Hermiomie Asreal,"He really is not worth dying for, literally...do the math"
1561454201238016,1:09:50,Jayden Bango,"Zuma is a spent force, fading into the horizon. His peak is behind us"
1561454415838202,1:13:24,Jayden Bango,we better not have this advocate again after tea please
1561454441628529,1:13:50,Reinette Raubenheimer,s0 much respect for DCJ ZONDO
1561454445804261,1:13:54,Hermiomie Asreal,Why are they rising though...it's not a courtroom
1561454495094061,1:14:44,Norman Zwane,"@Jayden Bango Zuma was a whirlwind that left our defences all flattened out, we now have to revive everything we ever thought was useful. My worst regret about Zuma is he fractured even our minds."
1561454529828702,1:15:18,Dan Brown,"Zuma won't testify, because they wouldn't be able to bring a Bakkie full of files as he can't read or count unless it's in Huge Print. If he can count or read at all as he has so obviously shown."
1561454534816527,1:15:24,Wildthing,He is a Judge and you respect him for that Role
1561454640864259,1:17:09,Norman Zwane,@Jayden Bango We are so fractured we cannot even see a crook on two legs. Yesterday we still had bus loads of Zandile Gumede supporters just as we had taxi loads of Magashule
1561454715149959,1:18:23,Lesiba Rabalao,haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa wake up haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1561454764609252,1:19:13,Norman Zwane,s@Jayden Bango All these are people who cannot exposure of their leadership or fools who are hungry to be bought for whatever purpose. That is what I guess the zuma years left us with.
1561455002800765,1:23:11,Satyabrata Sahoo,jai sri ram..
1561455156654113,1:25:45,Jayden Bango,@Norman Zwane the biggest legacy amongst all predecessors will be corruption.Never in the history of SA has an economy be so wrecked by one individual's blessings
1561455434634606,1:30:23,Siyabonga Kundayi,Sorry i am late guys... coming from parliament
1561455468895509,1:30:57,Jayden Bango,this is one of the best lawyers

1561455591347855,1:33:00,Hermiomie Asreal,"Yeah, she's also well spoken"
1561455627046231,1:33:35,Jayden Bango,her mental faculties are well chiselled
1561455705423976,1:34:54,Wildthing,wow
1561455749475280,1:35:38,goldrick mafologela,South Africa in the making........
1561455792345596,1:36:20,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Hermiomie Asreal Thats her name, Jayden? and her van?"
1561455870016527,1:37:38,Norman Zwane,"Is it my ignorance or something, We lost Maleka, Pretorius and ......Now we have September (nice looks but no gun powder) and dithering Ms Buthelezi."
1561455899760218,1:38:08,Jayden Bango,I couldnt have put it better Norman
1561455900016484,1:38:08,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"Oops, @Hermiomie Asreal I thought you talking about this Adv now leading the evidence. She is also well spoken and i like her"
1561455921060419,1:38:29,Jayden Bango,Buthelezi performance is quite dismal to say the least
1561455948098698,1:38:57,Hermiomie Asreal,I only know her as Advocate Hofmeyr
1561455964983152,1:39:13,Mr Jones Parker,"@Norman Zwane , I dont know about Maleka, but Pretorius hasnt been lost because he is the team leader"
1561456002666212,1:39:51,Jayden Bango,The top guns are busy elswehere across the country and the continent
1561456003568776,1:39:51,Norman Zwane,@Jayden Bango Next Zuma and Jimmy Manyi will insist they will give evidence if only cross examined by Ms Buthelezi.
1561456017152266,1:40:05,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"Tough this one, but fair @Norman Zwane"
1561456018013732,1:40:06,Jayden Bango,loooooool
1561456034231977,1:40:23,Hermiomie Asreal,Maybe your favs will be back when Zuma appears
1561456056911218,1:40:45,Jayden Bango,i think zuma can present a better defense than the lousy Jimmy
1561456063019505,1:40:51,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Norman Zwane Zuma must be examined by Ms September
1561456089798907,1:41:18,Anne M.,@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Why? Will he be distracted?
1561456100080797,1:41:29,Norman Zwane,@Mr Jones Parker Why is Pretorius not in the house? Zuma got off the rape rap coz poor prosecution and I have nightmares of a repeat.
1561456216433668,1:43:25,Mr Jones Parker,@Norman Zwane I think he is busy preparing or something. But he is definitely the team leader. He is probably the one delegating who is to question who.
1561456256457377,1:44:05,Norman Zwane,@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Present counsel is like Tabasco - very sharp bite in small doses
1561456274044796,1:44:22,Jayden Bango,you are right about delegation Parker
1561456309629400,1:44:57,Norman Zwane,@Mr Jones Parker Very comforting thought indeed.
1561456326876565,1:45:16,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Anne M. He will keep on licking his lips and trap himself
1561456369437258,1:45:57,Mr Jones Parker,"@Norman Zwane , comforting indeed"
1561456393772899,1:46:22,Mr Jones Parker,Thanx @Jayden Bango
1561456512138576,1:48:20,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Norman Zwane Very sharp jeez. I am sure those she dealt with yesterday and before, had so much of a headache! I like Adv Norman and the other slim with short hair ..."
1561456542582007,1:48:51,Norman Zwane,"I find the use of the word ""SYMPATHY"" in this context very patronizing."
1561456553805410,1:49:02,Anne M.,@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU ðŸ˜‚ Maybe Ms September should sit next to Pretorius / Maleka while they ask the questions?
1561456690556810,1:51:19,Jayden Bango,@Anne M. I dont thinik so. they must be restricted to lower courts and processes until they can get their act together we cant manage to waiste taxpayer money. this commission is already behind trime
1561456716649089,1:51:45,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Anne M. LOL...WHY not Ms September?
1561456738154305,1:52:06,Norman Zwane,"@Anne M. when ""Black empowerment"" started in the late 70's the ""sit by Louisa"" kind of training was used. It did not wark for me coz it was the first time I sat next to a white female."
1561456755888454,1:52:24,Ashne Hesselberg,I pray that Maleka is the evidence leader for Zuma. Heâ€™s brilliant .
1561456757725788,1:52:26,Jayden Bango,looooooooool
1561456781615342,1:52:50,Anne M.,@Jayden Bango The advocates I am referring to are senior counsel who have been excellent in this commission
1561456808757817,1:53:17,Hermiomie Asreal,"I think your criticisms are too harsh, they may not appeal to you but that's not a basis to question their competence as legal officers."
1561456868734812,1:54:17,Jayden Bango,"this is the most important commission in recent history, we cant waiste time"
1561456874966593,1:54:23,Anne M.,@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I think she will be intimidated by JZ.
1561456895023302,1:54:43,cassim suleman,hofmeyr and maleka the impressive ones
1561456909939268,1:54:58,Thembelani,I haven't seen the commissions bae in a while... ðŸ¤”think her name is Refileo or something
1561456916037304,1:55:04,Jayden Bango,sorry to dissappoint but JZ aint gonna come here
1561456942763131,1:55:31,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Anne M. wHO's this one? She is sharp! Its boring, i could only see the four big Adv in this Inquiry website, Chair, Pretorious, the lovely Gcabashe, Norma and Maleka. Why others not in the website?"
1561456958651740,1:55:47,Norman Zwane,"@Anne M. It was either me smelling her intoxicaring perfume, or looking down at her very brief skirt, or her tight blouse - something was always in the way. It was best to go train in a classroom."
1561456982377825,1:56:10,Yolo More,"I said it before that they can't throw interns to our faces. This is a big stage, it needs big guns."
1561456995528989,1:56:24,cassim suleman,this is hofmeyr
1561457004648471,1:56:33,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Boeta @cassim suleman this one's name is Hofmeyer? She is sharp! Thanks for name.
1561457019817575,1:56:48,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@cassim suleman , Thanks"
1561457042697377,1:57:11,Jayden Bango,@Yolo More thanks for appreciating my point too...this is not about being too harsh on them
1561457089493766,1:57:58,cassim suleman,but she slipped up yesterday..she did not implicate the banks and sbv for defaulting on fica duties
1561457132740404,1:58:41,Jayden Bango,remember the focus is on aviation
1561457151502268,1:58:59,Anne M.,"Ms Hofmeyr and a couple of others, are not full-time on the commission. They are brought in for specific sections."
1561457164459857,1:59:12,cassim suleman,kalandra viljoen...money laundering ..500m a month
1561457188001215,1:59:36,Zanele Dayile,Me too Maleka is perfect for asking Butternut head
1561457211523658,2:00:00,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Ashne Hesselberg Maleka perhaps on leave and attending into his own business? Its unlikely Maleka will be here again after this long absence.... i suspect. Pretorious might be the one!
1561457228459986,2:00:17,cassim suleman,Jayden Bango..all implicated are informed to defend themself
1561457247278309,2:00:35,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Anne M. Oh i assumed but one never knows
1561457269837298,2:00:58,Jayden Bango,@cassim suleman kalandra aviation link was that lady's company at mafikeng airport

1561457287777385,2:01:16,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Hofmeyer was biting hard the money launders yesterday @Anne M.
1561457330899668,2:01:59,cassim suleman,Anne M.full time or part time..glaring that banks and sbv were in her definition of enablers
1561457392593334,2:03:01,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Yolo More Can't find Hofmeyer on that website... Only Maleka, whom i suspect he's left or taken some off, Pretorious, Gcabashe, and Norman"

1561457446390615,2:03:54,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Norman Zwane LOL
1561457450812297,2:03:59,Anne M.,"@Yolo More If you are correct, then the Commission's website is incorrect because they have the legal team being Pretorius, Maleka, Gcabashe and Norman."

1561457533316519,2:05:22,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Anne M. Makes sense Anne. Those are temp additional adv to support the permanent
1561457537594252,2:05:26,Nelson Musoliwa,What is the correct position in whether AA and BBBEE increased job creation than decreasing job creation?
1561457539797354,2:05:28,Anne M.,"@cassim suleman Some of the banks ""hands"" aren't clean."

1561457597682993,2:06:26,Lorna Kavanagh,i would like to see Adv Maleka tale on Zuma.
1561457640474294,2:07:09,Jayden Bango,https://www.sastatecapture.org.za/site/about/legalteam
1561457670301942,2:07:38,Yolo More,I am sure it is because those are the only ones who were with DCJ on his first press conference.
1561457720880105,2:08:29,cassim suleman,Anne M ..yes in this case bank manager did not need to be a rocket genius.
1561457741905854,2:08:51,Norman Zwane,@Lorna Kavanagh Jimmy Manyi cried like a babe in arms even before the 1st question from Adv. Maleka. He was terrified my that 'GOTCHA' smile on Adv. Maleka's face.

1561458280345007,2:17:49,Jayden Bango,@Jordan Strudwick I believe this guy is some fuel management expert at SAA
1561458418174846,2:20:07,makhosi nobhatyi,Zuma is wasting our time
1561459894915593,2:44:43,Mpho Ledwaba,"Zuma told high school students that there is no state capture, i doubt if he will will come to the inquiry. If he will come hee! m leaving SA"
1561459993926339,2:46:22,Owen Nyilika,He is coming in July to tell us there is no state capture in South Africa
1561460183451708,2:49:32,Owen Nyilika,"We a Here Because of Mr MALEMA, MR VAVI, MR NZIMANDE THEY DIE FOR ZUMA IN POLOKWANE CONFERENCE OF ANC."
1561460435586076,2:53:43,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Norman Zwane Gcabashe is an old croc with many tricks, i don't like her, and likewise Norman, a Zuma lackey or appointee @Anne M."
1561460454313712,2:54:03,Michael Michael,Owen correct
1561460507171928,2:54:55,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Owen Nyilika ""We're prepared, to die for Zuma!!!"" And then Zuma dumped them!"
1561460600225352,2:56:28,Anne M.,@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I don't think Norman is a Zuma appointee - didn't DCJ selected the advocates he wanted on the commission.
1561460650301711,2:57:18,Cyril Nyiko,Owen nyikila I think you left out the millions of South African who voted him to power.
1561460906065519,3:01:34,Dams daily motivations Madamalala,Zuma is a Coward to all ordinary Blacks
1561461685153266,3:14:33,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Anne M. Eff complained last year that Norman was a Zuma appointee in the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), 2017. Many members of that JSC appointed in that year anyway..EFF sometimes eish lol"
1561462361951079,3:25:50,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@ann So, from that context, Malemas of this world felt she (Thandi) was a Zuma appointee. But the main opposition never complained."
1561462705744674,3:31:34,Dominic Przybylski,Empowerment (regardless of race) is based on individual effort. i.e. self-empowerment. Anything else is a farce and an open invitation to corruption.
1561463656644697,3:47:25,Magda Seguin,"800 million litres of fuel per annum instead of the normal 442 000 per annum was used and there was no procurement,only a WhatsApp message"

1561465131963526,4:12:00,Magda Seguin,Remember the Guptas had a plane...but I'm speculating
1561465182202863,4:12:51,Magda Seguin,Estelle Loocks testimony was different
1561465208343284,4:13:18,Dominic Przybylski,"I spoke to Exon executive in apartheid days and asked why he wasn't doing business in SA. His answer was that in rest of Africa they could do what they like if they pay bribes, but in SA there was law"
1561465220479431,4:13:29,Magda Seguin,"Something fishy going on here,Loock said she was not comfortable with EML"
1561465263129863,4:14:11,Magda Seguin,Dominic it is the same with pharma companies
1561465328346524,4:15:16,Mike Meyer,capitalism sucks
1561465365287190,4:15:54,Magda Seguin,African governments do not put experts in their fields in governments hence you see eg Mbaks going from sport to transport
1561465380696512,4:16:08,Dominic Przybylski,"Is all part of becoming a standard African country where corruption rules - ""decolonisation"""
1561465471038368,4:17:39,Mike Meyer,neo colonialism!
1561465474239828,4:17:42,Born free,Africa is a lawless contintent.
1561465474285181,4:17:42,Magda Seguin,"Having worked with government bodies in SA,they all use consultants that earn millions as government cadres unable to do the work"
1561465593467141,4:19:41,Magda Seguin,Mboweni put checks and saving measures for the municipalities in place now they are complaining that they cant use consultants.They dont do the work they are employed for.
1561465642267748,4:20:30,Diana Sekatane,"what about that German company on the arms deal. Corruption cuts across most countries even in Europe, west and east."
1561465647572054,4:20:36,Dominic Przybylski,I was friendly with a PAC member just after they were unbanned. He had a whole lot of Nigerian friends who became directors in all the big companies based on BEE. Local blacks were too slow.
1561465846419651,4:23:55,Jayden Bango,what does speaking over someone whoi has not finished show. yesterday we had a lot of it from Viljoen who constatntly distracted the judge
1561465936837959,4:25:25,Dominic Przybylski,Perspective of morality is very different between Europe and Africa. European morality is based on merit. African morality based on benifitting family/tribe/race ahead of merit.
1561465994049174,4:26:22,Fred Botha,They use voice typing @Jayden Bango
1561466082553654,4:27:50,Lee D. Hendrix,"..Denel SOC/ Weapons Ind. is a pivotal for turnaround funds, uncontested, to cover all gov. aspects, and claims that it can't pay its employees, what a joke on math/MOS sums."
1561466130236744,4:28:38,Mike Meyer,DP...you certainly have no idea what you are on about.
1561466180426997,4:29:29,Bongani Sondlo,who is this guy..? did he ask not to be shown on camera..?
1561466218225909,4:30:07,Jayden Bango,its your lazy engineers again
1561466262927801,4:30:51,Jayden Bango,@DJ DJ dream on. aint gonna hapoen
1561466267813136,4:30:57,Dominic Przybylski,@DJ DJ He'll find a way to avoid it. Sudden illness is my guess.
1561466278863514,4:31:07,DJ DJ,Lol guys.
1561466299435350,4:31:28,DJ DJ,He does make me laugh requesting questions prior to coming to inquiry
1561466335417448,4:32:03,DJ DJ,allready his laywers are saying that this commission is design to make him look bad
1561466387411403,4:32:55,Diana Sekatane,Zuma has to appear because the buck stopped with him as the person accounting to the voters. By the way he took an oath.
1561466389201785,4:32:57,Robert Russell,Yip JZ and DD on the same Poisoning bullshit story.... @Dominic Przybylski
1561466413773628,4:33:22,Dominic Przybylski,Oath means nothing to JZ
1561466587634262,4:36:16,Born free,Zuma is key to this commission of enquiry. He will be supeoned should he not volunteer to appear. The evidence leader must be Mr Pretoria or Ms Hoffmeyer .
1561466633848889,4:37:02,Born free,Pretorius
1561466643556400,4:37:12,Dabble Smith,"Hello friends, Sawubona bahlobo"
1561466648375718,4:37:17,Robert Russell,You have to put Maleka into the mix.....
1561466659476213,4:37:27,Dominic Przybylski,"If he does appear I expect him to refuse to answer questions, just sit silently and ""Heh heh."""
1561466712406103,4:38:21,Robert Russell,The sad thing is that we are going to pay for his legal council in this commission
1561466726840507,4:38:35,Born free,Zuma wanted the questions so he could learn to answer in parrot fashion
1561466769716243,4:39:18,Dominic Przybylski,We paying pension for him and his 5 wives at nearly same amount as when he was president.
1561466845891819,4:40:34,Robert Russell,for this commission he is..... the Presidency confirmed this on Monday
1561466846198460,4:40:35,Kevin Simon,Exactly the point Dominic. And he can't get by on that.
1561466853557808,4:40:42,Born free,I can't wait to see Zuma sweat ðŸ˜…
1561466854822382,4:40:43,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Born free yes he trying to sabotage commission as if he is corporate where he seems escaping, he must answer those whom implicated him"
1561466918153126,4:41:46,Dominic Przybylski,Is why he eventually gave up presidency. Alternative was impeachment where he would lose his pension and continuing perks.
1561466991113751,4:42:59,Lee D. Hendrix,"... Zuma... President of the Corporation of Countries/ States, as Senior Executive, this why the incorporated Countries / States do not capture Zuma for infractions, is corruption/ed by design."
1561467019165505,4:43:28,Born free,Surely if Zuma is found guilty in a court of law all his perks will fall away??
1561467068254796,4:44:16,Dominic Przybylski,Not sure @Born free. Depends if/what he is found guilty of.
1561467085545167,4:44:33,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Domini Przybylski the old he still thinks he is a president or he will be a president in near future, times will come when his supporters move away from him"
1561467097490331,4:44:45,Robert Russell,He should be charged with TREASON
1561467151226137,4:45:39,Dominic Przybylski,Guptas taught him and Dudu Myeni how to hide evidence by never putting anything in writing.
1561467175555976,4:46:04,Born free,Can Zuma write???
1561467184318475,4:46:12,Kevin Simon,RSA economy almost as damaged as those countries at war. Horrific.
1561467212074260,4:46:41,Robert Russell,@Dominic Przybylski ..... no writing is a ANC tactic... taught to them by the Russians
1561467232730373,4:47:01,Jayden Bango,bye bye guys. it wasnt much fun today
1561467248123423,4:47:16,Stacey-Lee Marshall,Wow I wish my day at work ended whenever

1561467255055515,4:47:23,Bongani Sondlo,Bye bye..
1561467272517455,4:47:41,Robert Russell,Exactly my point....
