1602073558709973,11:18,Cerebis,I see the ANCYL says that he is being sidelined to facilitate WMC. Here we go again. Always somebody else's fault.
1602073590515823,11:51,Angelo Doubel,@Peet venter. tjo😱. I see truter of VBS bank heist received 7 years
1602073593379029,11:53,ALTA,exactly agree peet and simmy
1602073596895208,11:57,Kevin Simon,This is a low energy witness.
1602073604088643,12:05,Jenny Whitewaves,@Peet Venter I understand this is part of a deal he testifies against others and gets alight sentence

1602073667006835,13:07,Cerebis,All those VBS Crooks must be jailed. 7 years seems too little for stealing old people's savings?
1602073690561439,13:31,Simmy Ndlovu,"ATLA ,😂😂😂"
1602073708530925,13:49,Gugulethu Dube,I suspect Ace Magashule was interviewed by the Hawks and did not do well so this could be the cause of all the panic.
1602073721281551,14:02,Nomkhosi Zulu,no no my apologies I'm just watching but I now and again press by mistake. my sincere apologies
1602073730562162,14:12,Sal SA,With due respect this witness waffling.
1602073738645616,14:18,ALTA,yah simmy ace is involved thats my opinion
1602073766648456,14:47,Jongi Cayalli,"if u steal small amount of cash of course u will go 2 jail for a long time, than someone who steals billions of rands.. it's leaves🙌 bribe the judge an then u get less years.."
1602073781598393,15:02,Mathapelo Mokadi,"I dont think Ace is panicking , this people they own the country everything is possible for them"
1602073825623387,15:46,Bantu Sodaba,@cerebis Truter took a plea bargain 10 years with 3 years suspended. he must have showed remorse as well.
1602073826834855,15:47,Jongi Cayalli,😉@ATLA
1602073842300220,16:02,Mohamed Mia,Steal millions you walk free steal a loaf of bread you get jail time

1602073943791300,17:44,Tommygun,@Mathapelo Mokadi He was head of a company that turned over a billion rands in a few years. Hes not short of cash
1602073947389723,17:47,luyolo mcoshana,these people must pay back the money before they go to jail
1602073948814922,17:49,Blake Yogi,"@Mathapelo, Sodis company made over R1 Billion in a year so R500K aint much"
1602073949424103,17:52,Thobani Mkananda,@Jongi Cayalli It baffles me. Mr. Truter oversaw the looting investments of the poor at VBS but he gets a mere 7 years sentence.
1602073951821184,17:54,Happy Modise,the jail is only to vote anc out
1602073956376404,17:56,Kevin Simon,Sodi used his ill-gotten cash to pay his bail. Bizzare
