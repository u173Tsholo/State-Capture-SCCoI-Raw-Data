1567415819396249,2:16:14,Danie Nilsen,"Judges are not auctioneers they make decicions on people,s lives so they never rush it"

1567416198148229,2:22:32,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Gee Peex1 yes for me that Judgement was not decided on bringing back coz he never vacate office by himself he was persuaded by the president to vacate office
1567416229177231,2:23:02,Born free,It sounds like this man was not employed for longer than 6 months
1567416294747563,2:24:09,Henry Mayambu,My view is that justice Zondo is very careful when selecting the words to use as judge understands the meaning of words to some extent different from the ordinarily use of some of these words.
1567416300405757,2:24:15,makhosi nobhatyi,He was trying to buy you sir

1567416998718928,2:35:52,Feleleng Banda,what will happen after all these coz they have already wasted more than 50m if I'm not mistaken...
1567417060729018,2:36:54,makhosi nobhatyi,Commission will go to investigate those conversations recording and we will hear who lied here because DCJ is looking for facts
