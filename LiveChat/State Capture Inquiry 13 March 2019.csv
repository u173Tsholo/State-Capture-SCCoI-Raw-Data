1552463087589276,35:32,Magda Seguin,The EFF says Gordhan is the devil and their followers regurgitate the hate
1552463103098274,35:48,Prince K. Dube,This application will fail simply. because Moyane has not provided a version of the things he disputes.
1552463103361929,35:48,Zamile Sokoyi,The chair enjoys listening to himself
1552463129660276,36:14,Joel Mzayidume,"@Magda Seguin who is the thief, EFF and Zuma or Gordhan. The law will test that so let the commission continue"

1552463279862261,38:45,Desmond Masilela,"Guy Mpofu is a member of EFF, but his working for his own bar. So This has got nothing to do with Eff. Moyane did not come to Eff and ask Mpofu to present him. but he went to Mpofu's bar."

1552472576594788,3:13:42,Mpho Mashigo,thabiso you know nothing about ZUMA... media lied to you
1552472590809963,3:13:56,Joel Mzayidume,Maleka is a big gun. I suddenly can't compare him to Mpofu
1552472597468815,3:14:02,Ntombethemba Manase,This is boring. Let me go back to GUPTA project😂😂. Ndakuva ngani. I cant dzeal with chartered accountants. It is too much for my understanding. Nindibize xa kuthethwa ngamasela.

1552472649007354,3:14:54,Norman Zwane,@Ntombethemba Manase Its going downhill
1552472663206158,3:15:08,Frik Brits,"@Santo Ka Khazana - Swami Sharnanandji , We deffinately do NOT understand Hindi."
1552472716657286,3:16:01,makhosi nobhatyi,"Mpofu and ngcukaithobi is small boys to Maleka, Maleka is a SC highly qualify"

1552472760728732,3:16:46,Thabiso Itumeleng,"Even if the media lied to me, we want to here their site to the story."
1552472791750844,3:17:16,Norman Zwane,@Frik Brits Is that @Santo Ka Khazana - Swami Sharnanandji Hindi? My laptop at times does that and I tend to take in for repairs. Now I know who to ask to tell me what the message is.
1552472797727668,3:17:22,Mpho Mashigo,witness lying again... Glencore wanted a higher rate for your coal because they lost business abroad
1552472832242313,3:17:56,Joel Mzayidume,@Mpho Mashigo are you serious he's lying?
1552472832906304,3:17:57,Siviwe Slara,They do have a basic accounting course ... even those that do not do Commercial/Corporate Law as a major
1552472855885146,3:18:20,Sandile Khowane,"Prime Minister Gordan is trying to duck and dive, he needs to come back to the commission to be cross examined, the Prime Minister is taking chances."
1552472862517309,3:18:27,Frik Brits,"@Norman Zwane The message was : ""Vote in the Lok Sabha elections, not to say that the statue of Afzal Guru becomes higher than Sardar Patel. """
1552472890716238,3:18:55,makhosi nobhatyi,Have you ever heard about Mpofu and Ngcukaitobi b4? They were popular in marikana and land redistribution
1552472911380073,3:19:16,Mpho Mashigo,Joel... Koko spilled the beans on Glencore...on Eskom enquiry

1552473003344983,3:20:48,Frik Brits,"@Norman Zwane , If u used Linux as a OS you would be able to see these foreign languages, and then use Google translate to get the English."
1552473011746586,3:20:56,Mpho Mashigo,suspended obligations means breaching eskom contract by not supplying coal... creating a load shedding crisis to get your way nja😡😡😡
1552473018223889,3:21:02,Eslon Eslon,"@Joel Mzayidume, Dali Mpofu and Tembeka are young advocate Maleka SC is a veteran and seasoned lawyer plz don't compare him half politician half lawyers characters"
1552473019946266,3:21:04,Norman Zwane,@Frik Brits So what to do when my lap top flashes such messages (aka a Whiter shade of pale) - knowing the words but cannot make meaning of them - dash for the door or celebrate return of the land?
1552473050601518,3:21:35,Joel Mzayidume,ok @Eslon Eslon I won't
1552473104476071,3:22:29,Norman Zwane,@Frik Brits Linux? Ok!
1552473151837827,3:23:16,Frik Brits,"@Norman Zwane , Get a Flavour of Linux, like openSUSE or such"
1552473229425901,3:24:34,Norman Zwane,@Eslon Eslon When Maleka wanted to cross Manyi; suddenly Manyi was like a boxer holding onto an opponent for dear life. I found it humorous. I think Pravin feared the same from Mpofu.
1552473271210665,3:25:16,Frik Brits,"@Norman Zwane , Mint linux is easier to understand."
1552473273916813,3:25:19,Norman Zwane,@Frik Brits You not selling me something neh?

1552473317515155,3:26:02,Jack Sparrow,@Norman Zwane Pravin will hold his own against Mpofu since he has nothing to hide. It's all just a matter of principle
1552473383726456,3:27:08,Frik Brits,I would realy like to see Pravin Gordhan here
1552473429066019,3:27:53,Mpho Mashigo,it's amazing how people speak on behalf others with surity as well🙄
1552473453224761,3:28:18,Jack Sparrow,@Frik Brits it would be interesting. But I understand if he doesn't want Moyane calling the shots
1552473555343761,3:29:59,Ben Cole,This is the first time a business rescue practitioner testifies. Can we for next 15 minutes listen and comment on what this witness says?
1552473582101467,3:30:27,Mpho Mashigo,exactly that's how business works... honour your contractual agreement...

1552473739428115,3:33:04,makhosi nobhatyi,"Mpofu was not going to respond to wat was on the table, they come up with new evidence per say according to them which is that already in court, Gordhan very clever not come here"

1552473802063659,3:34:06,Joel Mzayidume,Ok i missed his evidence.
1552473867446011,3:35:12,Trucker Trucker,"@Joel Mzayidume You missed ""his evidence"" what evidence is this?"
1552473871042657,3:35:15,makhosi nobhatyi,"Mpofu is a chairman of Eff which have fights with him. Now coming here to present moyane which he carries two conflicts, Gordhan will face them at court"
1552473896502328,3:35:41,Joel Mzayidume,i meant his 3-day testimony
1552473904814622,3:35:49,Trucker Trucker,@makhosi nobhatyi Mpofu is a lawyer doing his job.

1552474172381502,3:40:17,MIKE DURBAN,@Myka'Al Daud ...SkellemLathuli.....must fall.....i reckon
1552474262184602,3:41:46,Eslon Eslon,Dali Mpofu want to use the commission to discredit Pravin bcos of the eff political agenda against him.
1552474326251013,3:42:50,Mpho Mashigo,Google Glencore and what it has done in the DRC same story... these people are international criminals 😡
1552474457726470,3:45:02,Saider Sai,"This is not the first inquiry we heard in this country, none of them has ever took any action, in the inquire of Selebi, only him was prostituted and they were many people implicated!!"
1552474600380913,3:47:25,Derek Main,@Saider Sai Selebi chose bad friends - Angelotti turned state witness against Selebi and so he wasn't prosecuted.
1552474602025721,3:47:26,Myka'Al Daud,"Eslon u accept ppl must come there n discredit other politicians bcos of factional battle,but no one must touch Pravin"
1552474713656293,3:49:18,mrziii mrziii,Mpofu is a qualified professional. The commission wouldnt let him participate in this if there is conflict of interest.
1552474735430003,3:49:40,Donovan Peters,"Malema only hates Pravin bcos he was commissioner when they took his farms,alas Land Expropriation today.He wants those farms back."
1552474749653759,3:49:54,Trucker Trucker,What is Pravin running from?
1552474770584909,3:50:16,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Trucker I understand he is a lawyer but a politician, eff is targeted Gordhan to defeat ANC from moving, they have seen Gordhan is doing clean up and save our party from individuals"
1552474776978292,3:50:21,Myka'Al Daud,I m happy that chair will consider facts n not innuedos spread by media
1552474826016181,3:51:10,Trucker Trucker,@makhosi nobhatyi PRAVIN GORDHAN HAS CLEANED UP NOTHING!1 HE WAS FINANCE MINISTER FOR 9 YEARS AND HE CLEANED NOTHING.
1552474839489639,3:51:24,Donovan Peters,"On facts, Moyane has lost all legal cases."
1552474897622872,3:52:22,Norman Zwane,"@Jack Sparrow It may well be a matter of principle. To a lay person like me, however, there is perception that he is running scared. @Eslon Eslon I have the utmost respect for any professional."
