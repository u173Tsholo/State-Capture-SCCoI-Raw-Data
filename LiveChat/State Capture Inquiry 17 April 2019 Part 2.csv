1555502799395749,-2:02,Alexander Dowding,I’m just here for the comments.
1555502991943093,0:59,S Nompozolo,PART 2 Im ready....
1555503058801694,2:07,Felix Muyoba,@Alexander Dowding as long as the comments are related to the discussions at the commission..
1555503091106061,2:39,Alexander Dowding,I don’t have any problems with that @Felix Muyoba
1555503128519334,3:16,funicanz,@Felix Muyoba 😆
1555503182766920,4:12,Alexander Dowding,I’ve got to water my weed plants. Be right back
1555503193902320,4:22,Felix Muyoba,@funicanz and @Alexander Dowding in most cases i beg your pardon..
1555503373986674,7:22,Magda Seguin,Commissioner Ngobeni appears to have been fully captured.She allowed Panday to act like the Guptas
1555503385195912,7:33,Sindiswa Moolman,Very interesting @Thando Nkutha. We heard about husbands parties paid by service providers and over charges.
1555503436256002,8:24,funicanz,"@Felix Muyoba , I like your statement. That's exactly what we emphasized yesterday with @Magda Seguin. So my laughter is based on the fact that those that comment here follow this inquiry respectfully"
1555503570049613,10:39,funicanz,Commissioner Ngobeni appears to have been in a similar position as Nomgcobo Jiba. Things happening under her guidance and she'll appear to not being aware of the shenanigans.
1555503570218790,10:39,Magda Seguin,The commission is far from completed Robert who knows what skeletons will still be exposed.PS:Add Ace to your list
1555503616211732,11:23,Magda Seguin,Ace has his own personal 'state capture' in the FS
1555503624111835,11:32,Robert Russell,Ace is part of the ANC looting cabal... @Magda Seguin
1555503710004967,12:58,Magda Seguin,Yes but he and Mabuza had their own parallel situations apart from the mother organisation
1555503734167123,13:21,Robert Russell,and you forgot Supra!!!!
1555503790672988,14:18,Magda Seguin,There are so many...yes off course Supra is another situation
1555503803117344,14:31,Wildthing,The large rhino horn find in NW has some smell of Supra
1555503838132726,15:06,Robert Russell,No doubt @Michael Wild
1555503856274676,15:24,Magda Seguin,"South Africa needs cleansing,rehab,debriefing,healing on a big scale"
1555503888753833,15:56,Magda Seguin,This trauma will haunt us for generations
1555503897348148,16:06,Robert Russell,Throw a net over the top 6 of the ANC and we have sorted out 80% of our corruption problems.
1555503919266979,16:27,Wildthing,we need death penalty back first then some healing and law and order restored.
1555503972390668,17:20,Alexander Dowding,"Parliament needs a whole generation of born free MPs to take the places of all these corrupt, worn-out ex-freedom fighters that need to retire to make way for the youth. Things will only change when"
1555503989843467,17:38,Alexander Dowding,... these political dinosaurs go.
1555504042888485,18:31,Magda Seguin,Young like he EFF? from the frying pan into the fire?No thanks
1555504065902322,18:53,rohan barnard,@Michael Wild death penalty won't work with our current justice system. Innocent people will be killed by the hundreds
1555504125954956,19:54,Magda Seguin,Death penalty has been proven to be NOT a deterrent to crime
1555504129125920,19:57,rohan barnard,"I do agree, we need young blood in the parliament. But people ho are not obsessed about the color of their and others' skin"
1555504206119726,21:14,MIKE DURBAN,We really only need a Mutiparty Gov with each party having the same number of reps......or something like like........NO Majority party etc etc......
1555504312890985,23:00,Derek Main,@Robert Russell Common denominator in all the corruption is the ANC.
1555504314873309,23:02,Magda Seguin,The Sunday Times articles about Gen.Booysen was complete with fake photos
1555504458065314,25:26,Magda Seguin,CR today again blamed kids being taught under trees on apartheid...I completely lost respect for him
1555504503180715,26:11,Robert Russell,The New Zealand parliament is made up of 88% of people aged between 30 and 59..... and a FEMALE Prime Minister aged 38.....
1555504509050652,26:17,MIKE DURBAN,Rama is cut from the same ANC Cloth.........for sure.
1555504532550590,26:40,makhosi nobhatyi,Who is this Jacob Zuma writing here?
1555504540595578,26:49,Sindiswa Moolman,Agreed @rohan barnard
1555504552215885,27:00,Anne M.,"A troll, not the real JZ"
1555504576028996,27:24,Felix Muyoba,@Anne M. agree
1555504577970592,27:26,makhosi nobhatyi,Anne M I thought so
1555504583394006,27:30,peter sikoshule,@Anne how do u know looool
1555504624826908,28:13,R R,Zuma cant use Technology
1555504626111720,28:14,Anne M.,His name hasn't been brought up by Booysen
1555504642660673,28:30,MIKE DURBAN,Heheheh....maybe trying to capture STI........heheheh
1555504647227412,28:35,Magda Seguin,Panday is a busy of Zuma
1555504656314464,28:44,Magda Seguin,*buddy
1555504706637472,29:35,Robert Russell,Everyone in the private sector who is a crook is a friend of Zuma or one of his kids...
1555504724815310,29:52,Magda Seguin,Edward Zuma is Panday's friend too
1555504761176056,30:29,Magda Seguin,And in business together
1555504772657582,30:41,Alexander Dowding,@Magda Seguin I never specified EFF when I said youth. There are plenty other other honorable and well educated black and other race youth who will make brilliant energetic and inspiring MPs.
1555504777559396,30:45,Robert Russell,eish... the general took arithmetic lessons from Zuma LO<
1555504777709258,30:46,Anne M.,"Yes, I know. Do you really think the real JZ would have typed ""he he he""? It's a joke."
1555504827969715,31:36,Felix Muyoba,@Robert Russell he should have said it in afrikaans
1555504859331592,32:07,Alexander Dowding,The brains of the present lot of aged MPs all suffer from a condition called Apartheid Hangover Syndrome. They cannot see the wood for the trees anymore. They must GO.
1555504885070364,32:33,Robert Russell,and Zuma should say numbers in morse code hehehehe...
1555504930407907,33:18,delphin yvon Moukouma Mboussi,JZ can even tweet
1555504942046833,33:30,Alexander Dowding,We won’t make any real progress until they go.
1555504942522818,33:30,Eugene,how much did you steel Jacob?
1555504943301118,33:31,Felix Muyoba,"numbers, numbers, eish"
1555504952973911,33:40,Lucky123 Thwala,I can hear the sound of DCJ breathing
1555504959000205,33:46,Magda Seguin,I hear you Alexander Dowding but first the ANC followers have to be exercised from the ingrained 'struggle' attachment
1555504966171785,33:54,welton paulse,i swa he is quite active on his tweetergram

1555505048649204,35:16,Alexander Dowding,It’s much easier to get a person elected into parliament as an MP than it is to get them out!
1555505050162476,35:18,Felix Muyoba,she is learning
1555505079342212,35:47,Magda Seguin,I think Zuma' s wife Thobeka is handling his Twitter account...she has the same style of writing on Instagram
1555505118601556,36:26,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Jacob Zuma How much do you have left in your account, together with Gaddafis stash??"

1555507908306971,1:22:56,Cameron Kim,@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN we already took it over
1555507928344926,1:23:16,Magda Seguin,They do...in front of Congress
1555507953069284,1:23:40,Cameron Kim,@MIKE LOCK that is the only way some people can respond when they run out of knowledge like the ANC and EFF chappies
1555507961973217,1:23:49,MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN,"@MIKE LOCK our government traditionally didn’t work like this, this is learned behavior"
1555507976599193,1:24:04,Magda Seguin,@Coder2100 the Mueller docs are being opened for the public today too
1555508001499415,1:24:29,Cameron Kim,@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN your government runs SA as a tribal homeland
1555508014287118,1:24:42,Magda Seguin,Traditionally means chiefs in charge?
1555508017921085,1:24:45,rohan barnard,@Magda Seguin I admire you. You have a lot of knowledge.
1555508054805685,1:25:22,Cameron Kim,@rohan barnard indeed yes
1555508061173852,1:25:29,Magda Seguin,Thank you @rohan barnard I am humbled
1555508075347470,1:25:43,MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN,"@Magda yes, we didn’t have to fake narratives because you lived in the area with your chief and you knew him and his behavior. Now everything is a facade"
1555508091127714,1:25:59,great gatsby,I don't see why we use race to address governance. It's been done since SA was put on the world map. Governance and understanding why you're in power are what guides the country's prosperity or demise
1555508100422262,1:26:08,Coder 2100,"@Magda Seguin yes, i recall...their credibility's evidence then i remembered their are around reading this comment"
1555508109201267,1:26:17,Cameron Kim,"@MIKE LOCK forget it , the tribes will NEVER come together"
1555508115132140,1:26:23,MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN,"@Mike Lock we were supposed to come together at the supposed end of apartheid and we didn’t, I don’t see any hope now"
1555508129287037,1:26:37,Pheladi Lamola,@Jean-Pierre Le Roux I'm interested in your encounter with the police last night 😂😂 What happened next?🙈
1555508163337609,1:27:11,Robert Russell,@rohan barnard ....yes her depth of knowledge is very impressive... but imagine being married to her @Magda Seguin .... you would never win a argument... 😃 😃 😃
1555508201558298,1:27:50,Cameron Kim,"@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN without WHITE PEOPLE the black political parties are dead, have nobody to fight"
1555508265035531,1:28:53,Magda Seguin,You are making me blush
1555508283290116,1:29:11,Cameron Kim,Interesting to see how many people from 3 rd world countries come here to Voronez ( Russia) to buy military equipment - with people starving in its coutries
1555508314674178,1:29:43,Coder 2100,my grandfather never approve of chiefs or kings because of the authoritarian behaviour
1555508330586851,1:29:58,rohan barnard,@Robert Russell if one is married to @Magda Seguin it's a blessing! She will definitely keep you on the straight and narrow
1555508332277364,1:30:00,Cameron Kim,"@Matthew Adams free land , free everything fake promises wins at every election"
1555508370404287,1:30:38,Felix Muyoba,@Cameron Kim ethically those people selling arms should refuse to sell them to 3rd world countries then..
1555508376956028,1:30:44,MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN,"I’m not saying the world was perfect, I find many things wrong with the way African monarchies behave and rule but politics changed everything"
1555508383232477,1:30:51,Magda Seguin,"The group of people on this forum are amazing human beings,we have been together since the start @Matthew Adams"
1555508399001300,1:31:06,Coder 2100,@Cameron Kim they also hide the tax payers money there while the people their countries fight for scraps
1555508403473742,1:31:11,Andrew Mabele,I feel like hitting Zondo hard on the chest.....that potatoe will jump out of his throat
1555508404344338,1:31:12,Cameron Kim,@Felix Muyoba nobody forced the leader to come and buy arms
1555508445954506,1:31:53,Cameron Kim,@Felix Muyoba even your country is here lol
1555508482813167,1:32:31,Alirio De Araujo,Very sad been robbed of the future of next generation.
1555508483395279,1:32:31,Robert Russell,"keeping me on the ""straight"" an narrow would be impossible as I'm part of the LGBT community @rohan barnard"
1555508489442632,1:32:37,Cameron Kim,@Felix Muyoba you vote for the clowns spending the money
1555508498797570,1:32:47,MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN,@Cameron Kim yes nobody forced the leader to buy the arms but if it ethically incorrect because of the world peace narrative everyone is spinning then the arms dealers should refuse to sell
1555508514161898,1:33:02,Felix Muyoba,@Cameron Kim if you accept the money then you are also corrupt
1555508525655631,1:33:13,Cameron Kim,@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN you live in a dream world
1555508536072930,1:33:24,Magda Seguin,@Robert Russell you can ask my LBGTQ friends...I'm not an ogre 😊
1555508557645663,1:33:45,Felix Muyoba,exactly @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN
1555508560110706,1:33:47,Cameron Kim,@Felix Muyoba NO - I do LEGAL business according to international law
1555508574059526,1:34:01,Magda Seguin,Please explain to @Matthew Adams why we block some people
1555508581556534,1:34:09,Felix Muyoba,@Cameron Kim no man..thats not legal
1555508584652992,1:34:12,MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN,@Cameron Kim so do you if you do not want to acknowledge that voters are blind sided and don’t know what happens with some of their tax money
1555508638863920,1:35:07,Felix Muyoba,@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN exactly..politicians use all sorts of things to hide their intentions
1555508640965236,1:35:09,Derek Main,@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN Arms dealers and ethical don't fit in the same sentence together.
1555508642785312,1:35:10,Cameron Kim,@Felix Muyoba It is the people your county voted for in a democratic election. You shoul rather adress this with the leaders you voted for
1555508661554509,1:35:29,Magda Seguin,Melinda I will not call it 'blindsided' but rather 'abused'
1555508681567662,1:35:49,Felix Muyoba,@Cameron Kim yes but you also should not sell arms to the leaders
1555508698428842,1:36:06,MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN,"@Cameron Kim we would address these matters if we knew they were occurring, these are side deals kept away from the media"
1555508702601784,1:36:10,Derek Main,@Cameron Kim It might be legal but it's not ethical.
1555508704743199,1:36:12,Cameron Kim,@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN It is not my responsibility to decide who can vote
1555508727189559,1:36:35,Cameron Kim,@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN the last cancelled deal WAS in the media
1555508730781812,1:36:39,MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN,What do votes have to do with anything?
1555508737508275,1:36:45,S Nompozolo,This sounds like a movie
1555508743908799,1:36:52,Cameron Kim,@Derek Main so what is your point
1555508754555267,1:37:02,MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN,Cancelled deal not occurring and one out of how many?
1555508765482660,1:37:13,Magda Seguin,I am listening nothing escapes me @Matthew Adams but if you say I must shut up I will not
1555508775342133,1:37:23,peter sikoshule,so why did they get into the car
1555508782498841,1:37:30,Cameron Kim,It was in the papers even in SA
1555508823189530,1:38:11,peter sikoshule,so there was general discussion
1555508831808182,1:38:19,Cameron Kim,@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN It was in the papers even in SA
1555508890318449,1:39:18,Magda Seguin,He must have wanted proof of the bribe
1555508895348435,1:39:23,Coder 2100,its not the people that that voted in 1994 but the one that didn't even in 8 May people will not vote
1555508896521370,1:39:24,S Nompozolo,@Thando Nkutha THRILLER
1555508918373885,1:39:46,Wildthing,if anyone doubts this man then they involved in this actions

1555509057514822,1:42:05,Robert Russell,yeah magda... but what will happen with that evidence under a ANC government
1555509059026718,1:42:06,Magda Seguin,@Matthew Adams I think they may monitor us things being as they are...they are aware of our disdain
1555509072708777,1:42:20,Sthakathi Khumalo,Funny language is the comrade accent right..
1555509083206241,1:42:31,Alirio De Araujo,"17 million South Africans receive grants from SASA, many don’t know that this is they right, many think is because of ANC, and there goes the election game we see at the moment."
1555509088939844,1:42:37,Magda Seguin,Robert I know the trust is gone

1555509190721252,1:44:18,Antonie Goosen,"ANC run by murderers, terrorists, fraudsters, thieves, etc....what did we expect? Gangster State"

1555509212207535,1:44:40,Magda Seguin,We are becoming a nanny state with 17 million grantees and only 8 million formal taxpayers.I know everyone pays VAT and levies but it is not nearly enough
1555509238441049,1:45:06,rohan barnard,@Matthew Adams I block racists and bots
1555509260810152,1:45:29,Rusty SpyGoat,"in the state address, Zuma said that under the ANC most citizens carry cell phones with internet access. The ANC actually tried to take credit from corporate companies for technological improvement"
1555509269816550,1:45:37,Alirio De Araujo,"Will never dry up, foreigner investors will make use of the bribery corruption CULTURE we been having from previous generations"
