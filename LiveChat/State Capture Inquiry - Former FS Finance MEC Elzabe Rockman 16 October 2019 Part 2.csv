1571229063709957,29:34,phibion chenyika,"This lady, the evidence leader, is very serious and imposing in her line of questioning so much as to instill some fear and confusion!"
1571229094357786,30:05,makhosi nobhatyi,She is being caught
1571229114354112,30:25,Derek Main,"If she approved the finances for Estina, then she has something to answer for."
1571229340005880,34:11,makhosi nobhatyi,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÉ @ Derek main she was told by her boss that project will carry on
1571229545319977,37:36,Jabu Malinga,this lady is lik duduzane..guilty for listening to ter bosses and doin wront things to keep ter jobs
1571229571147358,38:01,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi I think all FS officials fear for their lives when dealing with Mr 10%.
1571229677861888,39:49,makhosi nobhatyi,"üòÇüòÇüòÉüòÉ hey these guys they don‚Äôt play tjoo @ Derek main, surely they are scared coming forward speak out about corruption"
1571229693500556,40:04,Diana Sekatane,"kuzoba lit, chickensare coming home to roast."
1571229746073057,40:56,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi I don't blame them - people have already been killed for exposing corruption in FS. It's been run by a true gangster for years now.
1571229871888843,43:03,Diana Sekatane,It was very nice when they were doing corruption but now it's very difficult to substantiate what they have done with the taxpayers millions.
1571229916280911,43:47,Jabu Malinga,this lady is beatin around d bush. answering things with confusion. no oversight
1571229923417283,43:53,makhosi nobhatyi,"I am praying NPA, Police, SIU, Hawks move faster to get more evidence in before arrest I don‚Äôt want to see delays where we find out Not enough evidence"
1571229932119725,44:02,Easy D,Exactly @ Diana Sekatane
1571229935614441,44:06,Paul Buchel,"@Diana Sekatane‚Äã, you mean billions...."

1571229997234264,45:07,makhosi nobhatyi,We want all thugs to go to jail doesn‚Äôt matter how big you are
1571230003049348,45:13,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi I'd rather they take their time and get it right instead of having the cases thrown out of court for lack of evidence or bad investigation.
1571230116983034,47:07,Diana Sekatane,@ Jabu let's have a bit of patience the puzzle will unravel itself.
1571230178396898,48:08,Paul Buchel,"@Derek Main‚Äã, correct, the problem now is who the investigators are, how solid is all the evidence they're collecting."
1571230317390713,50:28,Diana Sekatane,Investigators must be under raps because this fightback will be dealing with them.
1571230340278123,50:51,Paul Buchel,"@I Am Free, not if you work for yourself."
1571230370472860,51:21,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Heather Cotton I don‚Äôt worry much about them sitting there at ANC headquarters but we will get them, ANC has failed to act and fear to sucked executives whose found in the wrong side"
1571230372784650,51:23,Anne M.,"@Jabu Malinga I stand to be corrected, didn't the USA take action on the request of South Africa?"
1571230405044385,51:55,Jabu Malinga,"Anne, I could hav been, but y didn't we act"
1571230421719090,52:12,Buyani Mhlongo,"@Anne M True,they took actions in response to RSA"
1571230443421220,52:34,Diana Sekatane,@Anne no..

1571230449245379,52:40,Anne M.,"The NPA has put in an extradition request, not sure how far that is."
1571230487253054,53:17,Anne M.,@Diana Sekatane What prompted the States to take action?
1571230490238606,53:21,martin bekker,is the grin on miss Rothman's face nerves related or what?
1571230566848962,54:38,Diana Sekatane,@Anne remember USA is acting as the police of the world
1571230581253340,54:52,Ming Well,Where is Agrizzi?
1571230654122777,56:05,makhosi nobhatyi,Remember those who worked for these people senior and investigators are still inside the department so first clean inside then run trials
1571230673670383,56:24,bongile sango,this dairy project is a headache
1571230749514223,57:40,Anne M.,"@Diana Sekatane Yes they are, but I think SA brought it to their attention. SA is small potatoes globally."
1571231316924524,1:07:08,nonhlanhla ntombela,why USA didn't close ranks on steinhoff if their serious about fighting all corruption
1571231956600731,1:17:47,Diana Sekatane,@Anne the capture was everywhere especially the law enforcement.

1571232964199889,1:34:35,Lee D. Hendrix,......She knows nothing about what a cattle-farm consist of and was placed in that position to effect an illicit cash flow. The ride should have been nice at the taxpayers' expense.

1571234551960883,2:01:03,Diana Sekatane,"corruption knows no colour, whites are being mislead that corruption is for blacks. During apartheid there was no transparency."
1571234620078026,2:02:11,Victor,She is lying now
1571234626593357,2:02:17,Victor,she had been doing well
1571234667195980,2:02:57,Derek Main,@Diana Sekatane I agree - corruption knows no colour. The guilty must face the consequences.
1571234695842049,2:03:26,Phil Rambau,couse if is black on stand yerrrrrr i read lots coment and something like that üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
1571234715390276,2:03:45,Derek Main,@Phill Rambau I'll take a guess that she is an ANC member.
1571234719227184,2:03:50,Diana Sekatane,@i am free what are trying to say?
1571234739288186,2:04:10,Carnoth Ngomane,@victor she's been lying all day long
1571234760349246,2:04:31,Phil Rambau,Derek ooh ok
1571234822929708,2:05:34,Norman Zwane,"@Carnoth Ngomane I have not believed her either, but I dont know what the truth is"
1571234907842575,2:06:58,Derek Main,It was clear that she was corrupt the minute she said that the New Age subscription by FS government was above board.
1571234913906519,2:07:04,Diana Sekatane,"@i am free numbers don't lie, why did the apartheid government doing with the money that they were owing the world?"
1571234914077047,2:07:04,Carnoth Ngomane,@Norman Zwane the truth is something they are prepared to take to their graves
1571235023379389,2:08:54,Lee D. Hendrix,...Corrupted minds consider themselves as what someone suggest they are and form groups of separated ethnicity. This is the psychology for controlling the masses.
1571235054901252,2:09:25,Diana Sekatane,Those who are found to be wanting must face the full might of the law period.
1571235061493732,2:09:32,Phil Rambau,this lady she's clever she always smiling and saying nothing believe me she taste curry big time üòÅ
1571235092133315,2:10:02,rosalind gerber,@Diana Sekatane what money was owing?
1571235160182370,2:11:10,Lady Bird,Does Apartheid era gov corruption excuse ANC corruption ...?
1571235197134095,2:11:47,rosalind gerber,thanks - how silly
1571235210040790,2:12:00,Diana Sekatane,The was money owed by the S. A government under apartheid which was to be serviced by the democratic government.
1571235224096021,2:12:14,Derek Main,There is no denying that there was corruption under the Nat government but the ANC have taken it to an entirely new level. They have perfected corruption.
1571235237291138,2:12:27,rosalind gerber,what for power stations and railways?
1571235240446841,2:12:31,clive oconnell,One so blind that don‚Äôt want to see Corruption
1571235240745928,2:12:31,Diana Sekatane,@lady bird no.

1571235271221082,2:13:01,Lady Bird,"Diana you could have fooled me ,and Im not easily fooled"
1571235279816730,2:13:10,Phil Rambau,üòÅ her eyes are burning shame
1571235361527743,2:14:32,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main In my other life I use to run a business. I often found that after sacking one of my key managers, the successor is even worse! I thought I was a bad selector but I soon learned otherwise."
1571235387006920,2:14:57,Easy D,"Ms Rockman will be heading straight to the pub after this session of questioning, she may even take up smoking.."
1571235387138715,2:14:57,Mongezi Mzobe,corruption corruption to the ANC they taking SA to the drein

1571235434357678,2:15:44,Diana Sekatane,@lady bird fooled you how?
1571235576881883,2:16:01,David Tuer,This lady has been put through the ringer and I think has come out pretty well unscathed. It's a pity others who have been here have not been interrogated so thoroughly.
1571235599138072,2:16:22,Lady Bird,DIANA the here and now is what is important . VERY important
1571235738102087,2:18:41,Derek Main,"@David Tuer I don't think she's come out clean. Seems like she just shirked her responsibilities. If she was part of treasury with oversight, why did they not stop the rot?"
1571235923239421,2:21:46,Diana Sekatane,Who said is not important...
1571235932127335,2:21:55,Lady Bird,These number are insane
1571235985202511,2:22:49,David Tuer,"@I am Free Let us hope so. Derek, As you say, she was part of Treasury. She complied with her Admin. duty's, so far as I can see. Deal with the rogues who set up this scam."
1571235987956380,2:22:51,Lady Bird,Diana than that must be the focus . Anything that takes the focus of this corruption is dangerous .Your discussion can be had seperately
1571235990138840,2:22:53,Diana Sekatane,corruption is as old as humankind.
1571236006229015,2:23:10,Frans Phala,"i think she is scared of the death threat, or she fears facing jail time, something is definitely going on here."
1571236014944697,2:23:18,Lady Bird,Diana and now what ....
1571236019325208,2:23:22,Confidence Selowe,y everyone is dealing with millions not thousands
1571236034109907,2:23:37,Lady T,someone needs to pen down memoirs about this whole corruption of state capture and even include the scripts.I will buy the whole set of books.
1571236035311418,2:23:39,Lady Bird,HUNDREDS of millions
1571236131984214,2:25:15,Lady Bird,Lady T nobody is that boring
1571236156532003,2:25:39,Derek Main,@David Tuer Of course - deal with all the guilty. From what I've heard she did the barest minimum (and maybe not even that).
1571236162897166,2:25:46,Derek Main,@David Tuer She had a responsibility to flag any indications that money was not being used for the intended purpose and didn't.
1571236246851360,2:27:11,Derek Main,@Frans Phala I would be scared if I was her - Mr 10% is a gangster thug.
1571236362343100,2:29:05,David Tuer,"Derek Main. If your take is the right one, does that make her corrupt or incompetent? One is criminal, one isn't. This is not a witch hunt, there are REAL witches out there."
1571236504489151,2:31:27,Lady Bird,"We have yet to assertain if she is corrupt , sounds incompetent in the least . The fact she did not flag wrong doing is concerning"
1571236642616880,2:33:45,Easy D,absolutely right @ Lady bird..
1571236672154552,2:34:15,Derek Main,@David Tuer I can't argue with that but that's very close to the argument that we should first deal with apartheid corruption before we worry about current corruption.
1571236700667788,2:34:44,Lady Bird,aha Derek
1571236702176685,2:34:46,Derek Main,All the guilty have to be punished.
1571236706342221,2:34:49,Frans Phala,this is just my theory but i think she knows something about Vrede Dairy farm killings
1571236731428502,2:35:15,David Tuer,Derek Main. Not really. I'm saying chop off the head of the snake.
1571236760522669,2:35:44,Derek Main,@David Tuer Well hopefully we'll make sushi of the snake.
1571236775345966,2:35:58,Lady Bird,I will only have faith in these proceedings if Zuma and Duduzane go to jail
1571236796571256,2:36:20,Lady Bird,SNAKE SHUSHI ....
1571236819652886,2:36:43,Lady Bird,even sushi eeew
1571236848802893,2:37:11,Derek Main,@Lady Bird I have to agree with that. The proof of the success will be the number of people going to jail. It can't just be another Seriti commission.
1571236951149602,2:38:54,Lady Bird,Yes Derek Commission upon Commission ...no jail . Wasting money
1571236991007018,2:39:34,Derek Main,"@Tholithemba Ntsele Yes - you're right but if people don't go to jail, then this commission will have been a waste of time and money."
