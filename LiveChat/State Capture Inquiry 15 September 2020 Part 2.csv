1600183726518388,3:16:31,HBWorx,"Body language obviously shows she is protecting big thiefs, not these small fries ..."
1600183750427540,3:16:56,Kido Kids,there were instances that she lied and judge zondo had to remind her of what she said previously maybe its the nerves
1600183771840654,3:17:17,a b c,Oh...

1600184093996541,3:22:40,Pheladi Lamola,Well the DCJ basically told her not to insult his intelligence and from then on she had to get it right.
1600184097757578,3:22:43,Richard Peffer,DCJ is tasked to determine if she is lying. The comprehensive report will illustrate the outcome.
1600184157056343,3:23:43,Thobani Mkananda,@Pheladi Lamola 🤣 True It's exactly what Ms. Klein sought to do at first
