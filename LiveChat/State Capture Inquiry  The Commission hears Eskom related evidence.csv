1610637394895104,2:41:31,Anne M.,I agree @Goran Djocik . He should have looked more closely at the affidavit before signing it. It happens sometimes when you have trusted employees and don't pay close attention as you should.
1610637419933456,2:41:57,Santa Kriel,@Andile Zondi with your bright mind to spot incompetence you are supposed to answer your own question?

1610638631828323,3:02:08,Brian Butale,"@Charlie, correct."
1610638636870448,3:02:13,Thandu Gonose,is the role of this commission not to investigate if there was state capture or not? or conclusions are made already.
1610638659846519,3:02:36,Siyanda Mhlongo,"1981,we celebrate Matolo Raid, Joe Gqabi kille. Is this what they died for? B Ngubane, Koko, Anoj, Mdluli, G Niewoodt, Muziwendoda Kunene don't know how bloody was National Democratic Struggle"

1610638900786482,3:06:38,Stix Mtolo,DCJ just coughed without the mask on... 😳🤐
1610638915749128,3:06:52,Chief ER,"@Jenny, they were under pressure to do it all within a certain period of time whilst they enjoy ""protection"".. hence they killed the cow instead of skimming the cream..."

1610639118590908,3:10:14,Jenny Whitewaves,@Syd Ram the guys who took most were not South African si they knew they would be out of the country when it hit the fan Also i take your point it had to be done before the presidents term was over
1610639118944200,3:10:14,Andile Zondi,Where's Lucky Montana 🧐
1610639127347443,3:10:23,Stix Mtolo,I hold the view that it would be grossly irregular for the Commission to conclude its work with the exclusion of the NPA

1610639272724896,3:12:49,Sharm Naidoo,If the commission is running out of time to complete this investigation so why don't they start at 8am instead of 10am when it's eventually delayed.
1610639274632147,3:12:50,Siyanda Mhlongo,"if anyone has evidence against NMR, TM and NRM must come forward. Zuma vowed to speak, he must do so than running away from his ""friend""."
