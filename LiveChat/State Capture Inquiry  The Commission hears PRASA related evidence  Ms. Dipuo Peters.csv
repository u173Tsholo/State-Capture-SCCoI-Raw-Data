1613979269261007,-26:10,Quinton van Eeden,salaam infidels 🤣
1613979793119735,-17:26,Diane Louw,Hi Quinton and HALO
1613979843072347,-16:36,Diane Louw,so i was right on Friday on why DCJ was keeping on about the guarantee etc cause he caught her in a lie and that laid the foundation for the rest of the time..
1613980057696474,-13:02,Quinton van Eeden,"fact remains - as a qualified lawyer and company secretary, she had a legal duty to provide advice regarding the transaction - one has to consider the power-distance relationships at the time though"
1613980276254225,-9:23,Lerato Moleke,Greetings All .. What makes her story more airy fairy is that her Eskom title was Head: Legal & Compliance - why did she agree to that fancy title & salary if her role didn't extend to legal matters?
1613980345959335,-8:13,Martha Sello,hi Lerato
1613980348227781,-8:11,bongile sango,Hallo my people
1613980360898614,-7:58,Diane Louw,Lerato remember when i said she was part of the legal team as she drafted papers etc.....
1613980367698212,-7:52,Diane Louw,hi marttha and bongile
1613980381796454,-7:38,MK Nzuza,who is this minister who is coming today?
1613980409993460,-7:09,Martha Sello,hi Diane
1613980431562299,-6:48,Diane Louw,And did you see her reaction when Seleka told her about the radio into and where she was named as being Businessman???
1613980443599285,-6:36,Martha Sello,I think is Dipuo Peters
1613980445433510,-6:34,Diane Louw,into = interview
1613980481337491,-5:58,Diane Louw,correct Martha
1613980541290910,-4:58,Lerato Moleke,"💯 @Diane - ""angelic"" Suzanne is no whistle blower she was a BIG part of this but got screwed "
1613980573771035,-4:26,charlie zamile,"can anybody tell me please,have they started already?"
1613980581098738,-4:18,NOOB GAMERS,nope

1613980614730199,-3:45,Quinton van Eeden,@Lerato Moleke - the evidence thus far does not suggest participation on her part - methinks she was simply in a job too big for her
1613980617171795,-3:42,Diane Louw,hi Teunis and sneakerhead and charlie
1613980632233673,-3:27,Martha Sello,I see news channels 403 and 405 are reporting that Khusela Diko husband has died except sabc 404. Does sabc know something else?
1613980646143970,-3:13,NOOB GAMERS,lol probably
1613980668990859,-2:50,Diane Louw,Yes saw the headline now..... Died in EC Hospital
1613980677431076,-2:42,Teunis van Ree,hello @Diane Louw 🌹
1613980753929305,-1:25,Lerato Moleke,"@Martha 😳, I'll check Twitter .. @Quinton, remember initially she lied about not having met Salim - some pieces of the ""snakes & ladder"" are missing🤔 "
1613980759521870,-1:20,Teunis van Ree,I agree @Quinton van Eeden

1614067281060132,24:32,Maritime Studies,@Louis C : These people can’t differentiate between the Government of the people of the Republic and their political party. They use a political card across the board
1614067283345072,24:36,Kevin1,@Maritime Studies there are many competent ex-SOE employees no longer employed because they wanted to do the right thing - they frustrated the corruption feeding
1614067298640289,24:52,Heather Durr,I am sure that she is duly and genuinely accepting-she is deceitful and arrogant

1614067670364180,31:02,Maritime Studies,Under her administration SAMSA from 2016 had no CEO. She left the status quo like that. To date SAMSA has no CEO. That’s why I say she destroyed the Maritime Sector.
1614067674953404,31:07,Diane Louw,yes it was convenient not to have a gceo so that looting could continue
