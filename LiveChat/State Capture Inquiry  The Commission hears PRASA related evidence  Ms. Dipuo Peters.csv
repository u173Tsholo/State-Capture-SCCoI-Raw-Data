1613979793119735,-17:26,Diane Louw,Hi Quinton and HALO
1613979843072347,-16:36,Diane Louw,so i was right on Friday on why DCJ was keeping on about the guarantee etc cause he caught her in a lie and that laid the foundation for the rest of the time..
1613980057696474,-13:02,Quinton van Eeden,"fact remains - as a qualified lawyer and company secretary, she had a legal duty to provide advice regarding the transaction - one has to consider the power-distance relationships at the time though"
1613980276254225,-9:23,Lerato Moleke,Greetings All .. What makes her story more airy fairy is that her Eskom title was Head: Legal & Compliance - why did she agree to that fancy title & salary if her role didn't extend to legal matters?
1613980345959335,-8:13,Martha Sello,hi Lerato
1613980348227781,-8:11,bongile sango,Hallo my people
1613980360898614,-7:58,Diane Louw,Lerato remember when i said she was part of the legal team as she drafted papers etc.....

1613980381796454,-7:38,MK Nzuza,who is this minister who is coming today?
1613980409993460,-7:09,Martha Sello,hi Diane
1613980431562299,-6:48,Diane Louw,And did you see her reaction when Seleka told her about the radio into and where she was named as being Businessman???
1613980443599285,-6:36,Martha Sello,I think is Dipuo Peters

1613980614730199,-3:45,Quinton van Eeden,@Lerato Moleke - the evidence thus far does not suggest participation on her part - methinks she was simply in a job too big for her

1614076400094239,2:56:32,Aubrey De Bliquy,It seems like CODESA did not give us a representative democracy because the parties nominate parliament. So we end up with a party dictatorship.
1614076406509941,2:56:38,Kevin1,Wow - is all this funny stuff still happening in SOE's - 2021???
1614076416576310,2:56:50,WareWolf,This commission has separated the sheep from the wolves

1614076454860781,2:57:27,Mr L,"*aside* The banks also need to come answer, how can so much money go missing without their involvement?"
1614076461442731,2:57:34,Danile Ngubenyathi,we are in crisis here in SA. all the parties are the ribs of ANC. others the likes of DA are there to oppose not to come up with new strategies to build SA instead they wait for ANC to flop

1614076474033320,2:57:46,Aubrey De Bliquy,If Zuma liked democracy he could have changed the law to make his actions legal. The fact that he did not do so makes him look like an incompetent crook.
1614076486646758,2:57:59,Louis C,@Pastor J.J He actually considered himself a hero! Now Fats is pulling a Zuma and doing everything to avoid coming back
1614076514276024,2:58:28,Sal SA,"Mr L. As a former banker, tell me what the banks must answer to"

1614076645921478,3:00:38,Mr L,@SAL SA are certain transactions which exceed certain amounts not to be flagged? irregular financial flows? atleast for those persons who are PEP??? why were Gupta accouns frozen so late?
1614076663344697,3:00:56,Pastor J.J,@N N Greetings bro. I am beginning to have serious reservations of Pravin.
1614076675428202,3:01:08,Kevin1,@N N The ANC will have to split for any hope in the future
1614076695869471,3:01:28,Aubrey De Bliquy,People spoke the truth while it risked their livelihood are the true heroes of this sorry story.
1614076708021947,3:01:41,WareWolf,The voters dont realise they could have had bigger social grants if this stealing didnt occur
1614076750723655,3:02:24,Andrew Mboweni,"@Jenny Whitewaves,alternatively there is a solution to each problem our country is facing ,you steal from the public purse punisment and blacklisted not to ever play a role in public office "
1614076753788940,3:02:26,Pastor J.J,@Kevin W They can split in 2 or 4 but that only means we would have many parts of crooks. The ANC must go for us to have even a small chance
1614076766362878,3:02:38,Jenny Whitewaves,"@Andrew Mboweni my children have already left, denied jobs here by BEE"
1614076809629238,3:03:22,Kevin1,"@Pastor J.J i agree, but is there any remote chance of that actually happening?"
1614076811600801,3:03:24,Mr L,@SAL SA during this Sate of capture and there is no suspicious or unusual transactions??
1614076820702851,3:03:31,Sal SA,"@Mr L. Banks monitor deposits into accounts that may be possible money laundering. They acted swiftly on blocking Gupta accounts, and refused to give time to find alternatives."
1614076836789028,3:03:50,Heather Durr,@Jenny Whitewaves So fortunate that they managed to find another home-you must be relieved
1614076859067983,3:04:11,Pastor J.J,@Kevin W absolutely not. The pigs will continue to find the trough. Its become 2nd nature
1614076867521472,3:04:20,WareWolf,This Commission will stop all the tricks
1614076869751860,3:04:22,Andrew Mboweni,"@Jenny Whitewaves,we can reverse that jenny as long as we can hold hands together we can make a difference jenny ,BEE it didnt work for me either i am independent from our government "
1614076908635949,3:05:01,Kevin1,@Pastor J.J hence we need some divine intervention 
1614076909635943,3:05:02,Sal SA,@Mr L. Yes when news broke of Gupta allegations
