1604044394843546,51:06,Heather Durr,@Goaten - Zondo feels f**** for Malema
1604044463656818,52:17,Goaten -,Malema got balls unlike Zuma. To scare Malema is almost impossible. I respect that guy for his bravery. I must say.
1604044551116150,53:41,LionView,Goaten (SB) baiting yourself? 🤣
1604044563256908,53:53,Goaten -,Malema never said black lawyers were incompetent. He said the black lawyers he hired for some case were incompetent. EFF has high profile black lawyers like Mpofu and the guy with dreads.
1604044579383042,54:11,LionView,just like i said (SB)
1604044607882030,54:38,Salmaan Abrahams,Yes the “black lawyers he hired ...

1604044686900585,55:58,Salmaan Abrahams,The problem with politicians is the people who keep believing them

1604044823342367,58:15,Salmaan Abrahams,So when a black lawyer makes a mistake the entire law firm is termed incompetent
1604044862901566,58:56,Goaten -,"@Heather Durr well wasn't Zondo supposed to subpoena Malema's bank statements? And now that Malema has said he can go ahead , Zondo is no longer pursuing it."

1604046487835693,1:25:58,zip reeper,@Pastor J.J .. I remember when Halfway House was a cafe and a hotel
1604046505486850,1:26:18,Pastor J.J,@Goaten - I remember that. Did that person assist you with your rent?
1604046522912751,1:26:33,ALTA,teunis ... no what?
1604046531293118,1:26:42,Goaten -,@Heather Durr no Zondo was owned in that interview. It is simple just type Malema grilled Zondo here on YouTube and you make up your own mind.

1604052798288346,3:11:08,Aubrey De Bliquy,Now they blame China for what they did to tehemselves.
1604052820161382,3:11:30,SanFran Arnold,Zondo was in his 30's when he had this relationship. Zuma was not even in a relationship with her sister.

1604052835146085,3:11:47,Fred Desrosiers,revalation on Zondo's personal life was meant to pressure him from pursueing State Capture harder. But many men in SA have love childs. that is no secret.
