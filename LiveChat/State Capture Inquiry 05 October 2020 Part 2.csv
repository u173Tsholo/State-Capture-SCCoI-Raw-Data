1601904901401749,36:57,Mzalwane Mzala,Former DA Gauteng Chairperson has become the latest former DA leader to join Herman Mashaba's ActionSA
1601904963538752,38:01,Mzalwane Mzala,John Moody joins ActionSA
1601905029015006,39:05,Elvis Malakoane,Mzalwane Mzala what is your honest view about Mashaba party
1601905097296680,40:15,Mzalwane Mzala,It disrupts the DA's foray into townships @Elvis Malakoane
1601905098764870,40:16,꧁༒ Wolfy Cs SniperEye ༒꧂,they all have memory loss 😑
1601905176732044,41:33,Elvis Malakoane,Mzalwane Mzala But do you think it will make it as a party
1601905226357924,42:23,Eddie Reddy,Music Maimane should join Herman it will be a real force
1601905277825456,43:14,Mzalwane Mzala,It will gain local government seats in Johannesburg and possibly Tshwane.
1601905310674297,43:47,Elvis Malakoane,Mzalwane Mzala I think so too
1601905320823826,43:57,Sicelo Sebastien Magagula,. l
1601905331528306,44:08,Mzalwane Mzala,So it will survive as one of the small parties. It will not be at the EFF scale.
1601905363615710,44:39,Eddie Reddy,Mzala if these 2 guys form a rainbow exec. they will draw a lot of votes
1601905390450894,45:05,Elvis Malakoane,Mzalwane Mzala But I think I most municipalities eff will work with Mashaba Than work with ANC
1601905429190804,45:45,Mzalwane Mzala,Which 2 guys @Eddie Reddy?
1601905505101502,47:02,Eddie Reddy,I dont think Herman will work with EFF after the Thawne problem. Herman is very refined
1601905539646042,47:35,Mzalwane Mzala,@Elvis Malakoane The second biggest party is the DA and not the EFF. Is Mashaba prepared to work with the DA?
1601905541344122,47:37,Lezil Lezil,I'm interested to know why zondo is so pedantic in his questioning around the timing of zumas entrance at the meeting of the 8th
