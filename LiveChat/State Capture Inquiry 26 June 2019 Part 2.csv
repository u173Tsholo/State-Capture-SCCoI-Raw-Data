1561551086823138,9:14,ssgs ssgs,she is proper this one
1561551153378840,10:21,Nelson Musoliwa,Simon you are correct this type of professional could have saved SA billions
1561551153693300,10:21,Reinette Raubenheimer,agree @abel
1561551197140014,11:05,Reinette Raubenheimer,brilliant witness
1561551209473410,11:16,Kevin Simon,Just get Zwane there. Get the cops to wait and march him off for charging processing.
1561551371598236,13:59,Mduduzi Thabede,😀😀😀
1561551392626030,14:19,shawn engelbrecht,hello
1561551405333496,14:32,shawn engelbrecht,i dont think so
1561551422446634,14:50,Kevin Simon,There's something very satisfying and being able to block Jacob Zuma. Love it!!!
1561551464215516,15:31,Mduduzi Thabede,@jacob Watching the parly debate ne?
1561551678460799,19:06,Kevin Simon,Mduduzi Thabede ​@jacob Watching the parly debate ne? Doubt it. They may read numbers and that'll scramble his brain cell.
1561551705167344,19:33,Mduduzi Thabede,🤣🤣🤣🤣
1561551799388261,21:07,Mduduzi Thabede,I’m impressed by the witness
1561551835401413,21:43,Jayden Bango,why were we muted before lunch
1561551896343943,22:44,Jayden Bango,things are heating up
1561551916735883,23:04,Jayden Bango,the Guptas and Gigaba in bed again
1561551984387743,24:12,Kevin Simon,Zondo has read this witness' statement and wanted to get to the meat of it. That's why he was so impatient this morning. I'm sure adv September is going to do better as well.
1561552030329610,24:58,Mduduzi Thabede,But it’s unfair to the evidence leader
1561552041382583,25:08,Kevin Simon,Gigaba clearly showed up as having been emascuated
1561552067622661,25:35,Kevin Simon,Maybe suits were too tight then already...
1561552129198989,26:36,richard borain,It appears as if Zondo picks on the advocate frequently
1561552209626342,27:58,Jayden Bango,@richard borain the issue is not zondo but the adv. who fails to articulate herself and own the show. she is still inexperienced and should never have taken this platform
1561552223524542,28:11,Nelson Musoliwa,She is falling short of answering the question on what was her overall reaction to this guy outburst why didnt she asked him about the agreement he spoke about
1561552245515897,28:33,Reinette Raubenheimer,dcj Zondo is actually leading the witness
1561552262366813,28:49,Mduduzi Thabede,Which is unfair
1561552264405710,28:51,Born free,hehe he eeh.. Jacob I can't wait to see you here next month.. don't forget your hankey cos you going to sweating under the heat
1561552288365324,29:15,Legae Nyalungu,ADV September is now Mabena😭
1561552298629459,29:26,carnoth ngomane,@Jayden Bango how else will she gain experience if she shy away from such platforms?

1561552562567263,33:50,Jayden Bango,@carnoth ngomane my point is she cant come hear to show us her incompetence which the judge clearly sees all the time. this is not a polatform to learn. she is failing the simple things ...

1561552763020860,37:10,Mduduzi Thabede,True
1561552821366816,38:08,Jayden Bango,"@carnoth ngomane .definitely, the idea was to give the rookies exposure but itsd backfiring and commission is pressed on time to wrap up thats why they now operate weekends"
1561552823008768,38:10,Bruce Andrew,Cricket much better- New Zealand in big trouble

1561553146588763,43:34,Born free,Zondo will issue a supeona if Zuma does not appear he will be arrested.
1561553152201504,43:39,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,I would rather lose a job than letting corruption to going on unexposed.
1561553195206635,44:22,THABE PHALANE,does to appear means to testify

1561553340855743,46:48,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Born free Yeah, the commission asked him to come forward. He will definitely come"
1561553364209207,47:11,Kevin Simon,"I don't expect Zuma will take the stand, If he does, there will be LOTS of abjections from his legal representative. Mpofu perhaps?"
1561553425116053,48:12,Lorna Kavanagh,Zuma and all his cronies and pals must stand trial for treason...... they have ruined this country just like Mugabe ruined Zim.
1561553456802888,48:45,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Thando Nkutha Thats all i know... subpoenaed to testify. Simple. A lawyer may act on his behalf or present him...if he does not comply.

1561557088497330,1:49:15,Legae Nyalungu,if you follow this commission..ADV September is always in trouble due to her lack of preparation and poor at leading witnesses.
1561557092600042,1:49:20,Born free,Cannot have Miss September leading evidence to Zuma.

1561557213128272,1:51:20,LYD online tv,QUESTION: How come every witness besides Agrizzi is NOT admitting also having their hands in the cookie jar?
1561557228507765,1:51:36,Christopher Maanda,@Diana Sekatane iAgree with u
1561557236751134,1:51:44,makhosi nobhatyi,@Lex Luger nowonder how Zuma will respond on the matter? I doubt he will break down on cross questioning time
1561557241837488,1:51:49,Sthakathi Khumalo,The real reason she was sidelined... She sold out and teamed with white people
1561557278467047,1:52:26,Bernard Matolino,@LYD online tv Because Agrizzi had an epiphany
1561557287406652,1:52:35,MIKE DURBAN,@Sthakathi Khumalo ........Eeeeesh.......

1561557308076193,1:52:56,Sthakathi Khumalo,What were your views on integrating black business??
1561557338317066,1:53:25,Diana Sekatane,Zuma does not know why are people on his case because he did not do anything wrong.

1561557436851127,1:55:04,Charles Nkadimeng,"Miss September not listening , she will ask a question which has already been answered on that long explanation."
1561557458514229,1:55:25,Born free,@ Diane.. because Zuma is dumber than Dumbest.
