1599575681581353,2:25:24,Andre Gerber,thats why the ANC need there votes. They can't afford what working poeple have ie. wifi etc. so they don't get the info of whats going on in gov
1599575700904127,2:25:43,Riaan DW,Is there actually a party that can change things around in South Africa?
1599575754875184,2:26:38,Thobani Mkananda,@SABC Where are the visuals?
1599575778502725,2:27:01,Riaan DW,Or start sending ANC officials to jail until they find the honest ones?
