1562162080329037,1:31:24,Moahi Hlapolosa,Why was the book brought to the commission
1562162107888646,1:31:51,Derek Main,Many of the things Myburgh wrote about we already had a fair idea they were happening.
1562162111262416,1:31:54,Wildthing,it was a reference only on rumours
1562162118643595,1:32:01,Jacqui Baumgardt,Prevarication always means lies

1562162174787918,1:32:58,Moahi Hlapolosa,The author is also not prepared to appear before the commission
1562162181711385,1:33:04,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,he should have just stayed as a warrant officer
1562162204529080,1:33:28,Clive White,"He is the first witness to the commission, who is of junior management level, all before have been middle level managers and above.. All henwas doing was following orders."

1562162225543151,1:33:49,Clive White,And for that he was swiftly promoted through the ranks.
1562162253110463,1:34:15,Wildthing,The poor Judge he listens 2 times. once in aMaZulu then English and it probably changes in between
1562162263034225,1:34:26,Jacqui Baumgardt,me too - I was following orders when I raided the bank the other day - where's my promotion to billionaire?
1562162274049869,1:34:37,Zolani Hoza,.. he coming to the bottleneck ..

1562162337818592,1:35:40,Ibo Thabo,But why this witness not explained how he got promoted from the position he had to the one he got after that plane incident? I think he was asked but just ignored or played.
1562162350142978,1:35:53,Clive White,100%
1562162373381634,1:36:17,Vincent Maleka,they must ask him about his promotion
1562162397981503,1:36:41,Derek Main,@Ibo Thabo Yes - exactly. He hasn't answered that question.
1562162434475170,1:37:17,Sibonso Masilela,yes

1562162485777763,1:38:08,Felix Muyoba,bu why he is here is about the landing of the gupta plane not about his position..so zondo is right to brush aside the book
1562162512599519,1:38:36,Derek Main,@Felix Muyoba The question still remains regardless of the book.
1562162516127617,1:38:39,MJ Mogopa Keke,He is now in a cage😨

1562162913985860,1:45:16,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,Giving the Col Van Zyl the blame
1562162916707917,1:45:19,fikile mbokodi,if they say kill people so you have to follow the command even if you know its wrong woow i give up

1562162945378805,1:45:48,MJ Mogopa Keke,Court Marshall him!
1562162949127338,1:45:52,Diana Sekatane,that is why he was given promotions.
1562162957316473,1:46:01,Zolani Hoza,".. shame van zyl, he's being dragged into this mud .."
1562162959532806,1:46:03,Kevin Simon,What happened at the NURENBURG trials t the Germans after WWII
1562162961349438,1:46:05,makhosi nobhatyi,This guy must be fired
1562162982435613,1:46:25,Tsepang R,"@fikile mbokodi that's exactly what soldiers do, they follow orders, they don't ask questions"
1562162996874146,1:46:39,makhosi nobhatyi,Van zyl will be testifying?
1562162999617805,1:46:42,Sofia Sofia,we are going through a maze with this one
1562163017181101,1:47:00,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,So the senior cleaner at the department of trash can have a plane land in South Africa - just contact Zulu boy and he will organize in zulu
1562163027329894,1:47:10,Kevin Simon,Van Zyl was told after the fact if I understood correctly
1562163038285068,1:47:21,Dominic Przybylski,Lessons of the Nuremberg trial have been forgotten. Everybody is responsible for their own action. Following orders is not an excuse.
1562163039967992,1:47:23,Derek Main,@Tsepang Ranneileng But they shoyldn't follow orders from someone outside the military.
1562163056214843,1:47:40,fikile mbokodi,wooow so that means when you are a soldieer you dont have your own brain
1562163058754343,1:47:42,Jacqui Baumgardt,"agree, Derek"

1562163107968761,1:48:31,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,Did he blame colonialism?
1562163109960310,1:48:33,Clive White,In any force anywhere in the world
1562163116128175,1:48:39,Tsepang R,@Derek Main that someone outside the military was himself taking orders from the commander in chief AKA number 1😂😂
1562163132644669,1:48:55,Nqobile Ndimande,money changes police orders
1562163134211246,1:48:57,Clive White,That was a lie
1562163148012120,1:49:11,Derek Main,@Tsepang Ranneileng Now you are getting closer to the truth of it. Nobody wants to say it though.
1562163154803935,1:49:18,Sofia Sofia,so he is just an EMPTY BOX up there ?

1562163188618441,1:49:51,Tsepang R,"@Derek Main they've been saying it, no one is listening"
1562163206726661,1:50:09,Derek Main,@Khulubuse Z Pay your workers what they're due.
1562163208366829,1:50:11,Dominic Przybylski,SANDF officer material.
1562163210935926,1:50:14,KQ-O’ American Lady,is he reading?
1562163213903041,1:50:17,Lungisile Nonoya,This gentle 'check collector' thinks he will be off the hook. Everyone in the value chain has a role to play. He is stupid and still covering up for whoever. I don't believe this
1562163221920591,1:50:25,makhosi nobhatyi,Is anyone whom higher than you at soldiers when you are not satisfied?
1562163235887682,1:50:38,MIKE DURBAN,Eeeeeesh...this major is sure covering up......another Jacobo fall guy...

1562163238548489,1:50:42,Zolani Hoza,".. but what other sense can one make from this poor witness, the guy is dishonest to the heart .."
1562163239543577,1:50:43,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,He is speaking in tongues
1562163246007840,1:50:50,Clive White,"He did to a point, he is now contradicting himself, and this is where Zondo is finding his weak points"
1562163254821788,1:50:58,Nqobile Ndimande,ayeye poor processes
1562163257762950,1:51:01,Sofia Sofia,A Crystal Ball will give us more satisfying answers !
1562163284045819,1:51:27,Derek Main,@Khulubuse Z You must go to jail for your crimes. You're part of the state capture rot.
1562163291606236,1:51:34,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,The magic 8-ball will give better answers
1562163296762357,1:51:39,Tulani Tulz,The power of number 1 great 😂😂😂😂

1562163338656056,1:52:21,Lungisile Nonoya,"@Clive White inevitably, he will be charged."
1562163353020370,1:52:37,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,Is somebody watching the sub-titles on this - it is hilerious
1562163360178873,1:52:43,Clive White,Probably by military court
1562163368249593,1:52:50,Diana Sekatane,@makiwa very correct.
1562163385886849,1:53:09,R hunter,Interpreter sounds like Leon Shuster
1562163395214757,1:53:18,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,So after all this - did you do it ?
1562163412894979,1:53:36,marorazsa,Claster...
1562163413814642,1:53:37,Bazilla Moffman,Give the interpreter some Bells
1562163415128595,1:53:38,Ibo Thabo,"With the previous witness today she said ""they did listen some telephone conversations"" by people who were discussing the authorisation, did they also listen the telephone this guy too?"
1562163417407357,1:53:41,Dominic Przybylski,Yes men get promoted. People with integrity get fired.
1562163427021276,1:53:51,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,The flight was not supposed to land. WHY DID IT LAND THERE?
1562163427927512,1:53:52,Gwandidla Makiwa,how on earth could you get that senior position
1562163446970032,1:54:09,Sandile Mkhonto,The chair must understand that there are staff that above yuour pay grade
1562163449063848,1:54:12,Clive White,This now implicates the Indian High COmmissioner for being an accessory.
1562163454822651,1:54:18,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski It's the ANC way.
1562163495098188,1:54:59,Clive White,The likely he will be called back.
1562163517848271,1:55:20,Clive White,Unless he is posted away from Waterkloof
1562163531991297,1:55:36,Dominic Przybylski,When is Kolwane going to be on the stand?
1562163543629060,1:55:47,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,Now the ambassador wants to place position

1562163617347974,1:57:01,Derek Main,@Ibo Thabo Infroming people they will be implicated by witnesses testimony.
1562163622367524,1:57:04,FredBKevin,tactic

1562163632280856,1:57:15,Dominic Przybylski,@Ibo Thabo Rule 33 is notification to a person where evidence by a witness may implicate him.
