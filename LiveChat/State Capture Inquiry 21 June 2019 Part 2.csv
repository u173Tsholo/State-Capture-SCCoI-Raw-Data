1561121968832133,16:52,Anne M.,Use the @SABC Digital News tag and ask them to sort it out.
1561121989547877,17:12,Margareth Waterboer,"@ Peter Pott. I can't recall Western Cape involved in BOSASA corruption. BOSASA merely used or bought their Fencing company, but corruption was not an issue.. It was a company that suited BOSASA"
1561122028424838,17:51,peter pott,"eish Prof mokgoro, no wonder he can't speak ill of Supra. comrades in arms"
1561122079143696,18:41,peter pott,anything bosasa must be brought under microscope
1561122117386533,19:20,Margareth Waterboer,But the evidence never revealed corruption in this issue..
1561122129039857,19:31,peter pott,he is the one who wrote this letter they discussing

1561122156430229,19:59,Margareth Waterboer,"I listened carefully, because I was really interested to hear who in WC was corrupt"
1561122179659695,20:23,Norman Zwane,"I think you'll all be deeply offended that we past the stage of even trying to find anyone clean within the ANC. I suggest it's like any brotherhood, if you don't sign up for the thieving you left out"
1561122223809397,21:06,Derek Main,Yes - corrupt to the core
1561122281217387,22:03,Sj Kk,Corruption exist
1561122322440624,22:44,Norman Zwane,"With respect to anyone in the ANC or with family in there, THAT is how it seems to me. You can only stay in if you are similarly tainted or are willing to 'look the other way' when things happen."
1561122374334200,23:37,Derek Main,The ANC cadres are as thick as thieves.
1561122386471599,23:48,Derek Main,All in it together.
1561122412001899,24:14,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main It's like looking into the heart of darkness and trying too find a virgin in a brothel
1561122418358511,24:21,Born free,Yes just like a pack of Hyenas
1561122453914049,24:56,Born free,Infact they are Hyenas
1561122553314590,26:36,Derek Main,It's something that was known by most thinking SAfns long before this commission. Only the ANC voters couldn't see it.
1561122650360596,28:13,peter pott,say comrade phatudi
1561122667670875,28:30,Norman Zwane,"As a constitutional democracy we must waste time and money to give crooks an opportunity to defend themselves, If only we had a despot and flush this whole crowd out. This is nonsense!"
1561122689444411,28:52,peter pott,we got a very astute deputy chief justice here SA
1561122690830224,28:53,nhlanhla nkosi,ayeye
1561122718193788,29:20,makhosi nobhatyi,Difficult question to answer patudi
1561122720426133,29:22,Norman Zwane,@nhlanhla nkosi Kwavele kwashuba
1561122721143235,29:23,Anne M.,@peter pott Yes we do
1561122806899481,30:49,Khaya Nomoyi,She is hiding something.Maybe I am wrong.
1561122823988164,31:06,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main From your mouth to the mouth of the gods! Line them all up & Fire!!!
1561122889815043,32:13,Born free,Yes I think she is contradicting herself as she states she knew there was something wrong with the Invoice but she paid it anyway.
1561122899660561,32:22,Mduduzi Thabede,The DCJ has sharp brains... for lack of a better word
1561123138465182,36:21,Born free,It was servicing Luthuli House
1561123146066658,36:28,peter pott,she is prepared. Only now before the judge she realise what a mess she got herself involved in
1561123204045045,37:26,Margareth Waterboer,The judge is the only bright mind in this part of the inquiry today..
1561123214291099,37:37,Norman Zwane,@Born free You kill me. The most truth is told in jest.
1561123228568571,37:51,peter pott,"make no mistake, this people are highly qualified. Only greed got hold of them. easy and quick money"
1561123271019872,38:33,Bernard Matolino,"@Margareth Waterboer You are so right!!! Cry the Beloved ""Cowntry""!!"
1561123275474884,38:38,Margareth Waterboer,Exactly @peter Pott.. GREED
1561123319335560,39:21,Norman Zwane,"@peter pott You may be right about the qualification, but she is not doing the Alumni any favours with this performance on the stand."
1561123326443672,39:29,Mduduzi Thabede,That’s harsh Norman...
1561123332566444,39:34,Margareth Waterboer,"Yep, @Pastor. JJ..."
1561123337739568,39:40,peter pott,"you are right, look at inventors of apartheid. highly qualified, but not intelligent. I agree"
1561123351873707,39:54,Khaya Nomoyi,This advocate is soft with her thats why the chair keeps on interupting to get clarity.This witness will be bad under cross-examination.
1561123355515654,39:58,Mduduzi Thabede,But I agree 😀
1561123479944170,42:02,Tsepang R,"To be brutally honest, Ms Buthelezi is a very poor evidence leader"
1561123482921143,42:05,Norman Zwane,@Mduduzi Thabede To the greater world these peeps tend to be the standard for how the rest of our kids are judged. I am sorry that she is so slow but how did she get ahead of better kids?
1561123534088177,42:56,Diana Sekatane,@Peter pott the inventers of apartheid were intelligent look at their beneficiaries they are well of.
1561123541366801,43:04,Norman Zwane,@Tsepang Ranneileng You get the kind of lawyer you pay for.
1561123563821245,43:26,Margareth Waterboer,She's been poor every time she was leading.. She doesn't probe..only asks obvious questions as paperwork reveals..
1561123594703507,43:57,Khaya Nomoyi,Tsepang you are right.Something is not right with her performance.
1561123616736673,44:19,Bernard Matolino,@peter pott Never underestimate the intelligence of apartheid thugs. those guys were smart. You dont keep such a system running when you are daft
1561123647786317,44:50,Hannes Prinsloo,the corrupt peoples lawyers gonna take all the lootet money then nothing left of tax payers money
1561123694803088,45:37,Tsepang R,massive downgrade from Hofmeyr so I disagree @Norman Zwane. Its got nothing to do with money. How did she even make it to the team
1561123706162559,45:48,Derek Main,@Hannes Prinsloo If the ANC cadres don't manage to steal it first.
1561123754751012,46:37,Derek Main,@Pastor JJ Pastor JJ .. and politicians.
1561123800452020,47:23,Thulani Bukani,@Lex Luger you should check a video of Louis Theroux interviewing Eugene Terreblanche. the guy was very very very far from smart or intelligent
1561123800936137,47:24,peter pott,apartheid is the system that in return could have resulted in huge death of a certain minority population . holding back from revolt by majority shouldn't be confused with stupidity
1561123802113810,47:25,Mduduzi Thabede,She always start slow but I guess it’s because her witness is not up to the task I guess...
1561123810890080,47:34,Derek Main,🤣
1561123849522316,48:12,Anne M.,"If you can believe IOL, ""On Thursday, one of the sources said: ""Baba (as Zuma is affectionately called) will be appearing before Zondo. He was advised against speaking, but he will speak"""
1561123859691666,48:22,Thulani Bukani,well said Peter
1561123954669173,49:57,Derek Main,@Anne M. Nope - don't believe a word IOL says - Iqbal has an agenda.
1561124003585117,50:46,Norman Zwane,That was a mistake ?????
1561124020472038,51:02,Bernard Matolino,@Thulani Bukani No. Terreblanche was just a later day buffoon. We are talking of architects here.
1561124078313323,52:00,ziyanda cele,does this lady have any info
1561124079592238,52:02,Mduduzi Thabede,"Norman I’m with you, most truths are told in jest..."
1561124188928046,53:51,peter pott,This is an unfair question
1561124218552534,54:21,Khaya Nomoyi,"There it is,I knew."
1561124229044611,54:31,ziyanda cele,boaring its like she is scared
1561124312505366,55:55,Norman Zwane,"@Khaya Nomoyi Like I said, the peeling now commences"
1561124341230384,56:24,peter pott,speak in setswana mama$😀😀ho thata fano
1561124374052834,56:56,Khaya Nomoyi,"Zwane, you were right.This woman is hiding a lot I can assure you."
1561124383953369,57:06,M aXe,ayeye this seat is hot!!!!
1561124432570427,57:55,Bernard Matolino,"@peter pott It's not a language issue. When you are hiding something, even in your mother tongue you cease to make sense."
1561124449627914,58:12,peter pott,"wait up until zuma speak in deep zulu, to confuse journalists in the house☺☺☺☺"
1561124562059065,1:00:05,Mduduzi Thabede,Where have you heard of exco i.e political heads taking a a decision or recommendations as to whom a tender must be awarded...
1561124593548778,1:00:36,makhosi nobhatyi,R50 million must come back
1561124624017706,1:01:05,Derek Main,Whatever happened to lifestyle audits for public officials?
1561124635700198,1:01:18,Pitso Mosetlhe,Supra must also come to the commission
1561124711964632,1:02:14,Margareth Waterboer,Translators will be made available...Zondo said so time ago for any other language used at the commission.. As these things are always done..
1561124812808279,1:03:54,peter pott,"and like in Oscars case, first few days argument will be translators using wrong words."
1561124882353324,1:05:04,carnoth ngomane,@makhosi nobhatyi soon he will be talking to the media before they even ask him to come and testify
1561124901917451,1:05:23,peter pott,"example, we got stuck for nearly five minutes, over the word compelled from the previous witness. so translation is not that easy. it's not only words, but content of what was said"
1561125142390106,1:09:23,Magda Seguin,Is anyone also suffering from Commission fatigue?
1561125149078777,1:09:30,Anne M.,@Pastor JJ Pastor JJ I thought you were also on a break because idiot's spam is still here.
1561125168886795,1:09:51,Magda Seguin,"I stopped commenting a long time ago,not worth it"
1561125197912223,1:10:20,Anne M.,@Magda Seguin It can be quite depressing at times. I like to watch some Trevor Noah to lift my spirits.
1561125217335471,1:10:38,Magda Seguin,I see my buddies are here all the time too
1561125218152079,1:10:39,Keith Hadden,Are we done for today?

1561125298299283,1:12:00,Magda Seguin,@Anne.M what do you think of SONA?
1561125391653586,1:13:33,Anne M.,"I wasn't able to listen to all of it last night, so I still have to catch up with about half of it. Actions speak louder than words, so we'll see."
1561125410219212,1:13:51,Magda Seguin,We had a 5 plus earthquake here in Western France
1561125425490310,1:14:06,Anne M.,Any damage at your place?
1561125458851307,1:14:40,Magda Seguin,"No,I am in Paris in the north,luckily there were no deaths"

1561125690020767,1:18:31,Derek Main,@Anne M. Yes - that's what's supposed to happen but we all know it doesn't. They get away with a slap on the wrist if caught out. Audits would lay bare the fact that they must be corrupt.
1561125753060511,1:19:34,Bongani Sondlo,"Ke gone ke gorogang, ke solofela ke sa fosa go le gontsi..."

1561126115947191,1:25:37,Magda Seguin,Som people despise Afrikaans but still use it everyday
1561126146142384,1:26:06,Magda Seguin,Lesufi is leading the pack against Afrikaans
1561126204156138,1:27:05,Magda Seguin,He is a racist
1561126250367477,1:27:52,Magda Seguin,"Racism will be the downfall of SA,Zindzi is a disgrace but she got a slap on the hand"
1561126350585951,1:29:31,Magda Seguin,ANC and EFF...divide and rule

1561126637469855,1:34:18,Magda Seguin,While most of the Zuma/Gupta acolytes are still in the SOEs they will cause havoc together with the Unions.CR didn't even mention disbundling of Eskom in his SONA as he previously promised
1561126638427514,1:34:19,kagiso lerumo,"SAA, ESKOM, SA POSTOFFICE are finished. Now we are going for Reserve bank."

1561127718807081,1:52:20,Mzalwane Mzala,We need to follow the evidence and not speed before it.
1561127747007986,1:52:49,Magda Seguin,If you see what Supra did in the NW your hair will stand on end...the health infrastructure is totally destroyed...that's just one example

1561127777074916,1:53:18,Ben Cole,I like this witness. Painful to see how she was set up and how her dreams were usurped by crooks.
1561127779345601,1:53:20,Magda Seguin,The defunct Gupta health mobile unit that did zilch comes to mind

1561129517962396,2:22:18,Magda Seguin,The DCJ must get everything on the table as it will go on record for the courts...a snails pace is better to get the details than to rush and they go to court unprepared

1561129529545723,2:22:31,Anne M.,"No, don't feel stupid"

1561129573170760,2:23:14,Some guy,even gays were exercising state capture😨
1561129599908551,2:23:41,Danie Nilsen,they were bending for friends lol

1561129805894443,2:27:06,Khaya Nomoyi,She should have been given her affidavit first to refresh her memory.
1561129838905473,2:27:41,Kearabetswe Ntsane,why did she sign without reading 😭
1561129862321880,2:28:03,Born free,Yes Danie.. it would seem that corruption is the order of the day in S A.
1561129869762408,2:28:11,Magda Seguin,"Normally all witnesses have their a copy of their affadavits,remember they are asked after swearing in if it is their signature.."

1561129995649149,2:30:17,Diana Sekatane,You can't win something that is not in a competition.
1561130014818901,2:30:37,Khaya Nomoyi,Seguin they do consult with the evidence leaders to refresh their memory before the start of the proceedings
1561130095711124,2:31:56,Danie Nilsen,"i did the work and did it well but the material suplied from the ""boss"" was sub standerd i asked him about it and was told to do what i signed to do and that was fencing etc (tbc)"
1561130101166654,2:32:02,aurelia nqeto,Is Mr Van Wyk black or white because I heard Tebogo Brian Van Wyk

1561130154860437,2:32:56,Kearabetswe Ntsane,you must never sign without legal representative
1561130187591588,2:33:29,Anne M.,@Danie Nilsen Have you told the municipality (or whoever issued the work) that you were given sub-standard material to work with?
1561130197093444,2:33:38,Magda Seguin,"This lady was naive,she was not aware if her rights that is why she was used as fodder for corruption"
1561130233321273,2:34:14,Born free,This witness looks familiar.. has she ever been a member of Parliament or in the government??
1561130235249019,2:34:16,Magda Seguin,"Eish,I am sorry Mama"
1561130242058732,2:34:22,Danie Nilsen,"at the first inspection from bloemfontein public works they were surprize to meet me and doing the work as they knew me from former work have done as a subcontractor, (tbc)"

1561130331893171,2:35:53,Some guy,yooooo🤦
1561130364025811,2:36:25,Anne M.,"@Danie Nilsen Okay, then you've done the right thing."
1561130418056972,2:37:19,Danie Nilsen,@Anne M. yes at the first inspection and showed the results of measurments i took and the contractor was absent on that meeting. long story short he got 21 day site vacation
1561130431601076,2:37:33,Mzalwane Mzala,It doesn't seem like she was a sophisticated business person as she applied for small tenders with only one or two people assisting as employees. the township kind thing
1561130503415922,2:38:44,Victor,Such ignorance shouldnt have given her the business deal
1561130507618074,2:38:49,Born free,This witness is not as ignorant as she is making out to be.
1561130522937509,2:39:03,Magda Seguin,Always rushing....there you have a strategy of coercion right there
1561130538183892,2:39:19,Khaya Nomoyi,She could have handed Corineca over to Van Wyk.
1561130546750105,2:39:27,Magda Seguin,@Victor...she was used and abused
1561130594222631,2:40:15,Some guy,"that's true... seems like the ""African style"" coz there's usually no one checking. suddenly chief Zondo is here to check 😰😨😱"
1561130603140098,2:40:23,aurelia nqeto,love them all but trust no one
1561130609236925,2:40:30,Danie Nilsen,"and i finished the work with the same material and got paid the outstanding contract as a matter of fact there was no shenigans as it is now, we worked got inspected and faults corrected"
1561130628353312,2:40:49,Mzalwane Mzala,Van Wyk saw an opportunity to use a person who have a registered business that did not really have work. Even the big tender was suggested by Mr Van Wyk.
1561130628400885,2:40:49,Magda Seguin,"@Victor this is how criminals work,they steal millions from pensioners with their Ponxi schemes they always go for the vulnerable"
1561130647652159,2:41:09,Magda Seguin,*Ponzi schemes
1561130712124354,2:42:14,Magda Seguin,Van Wyk inserted himself into her business and directed everything
1561130734792747,2:42:35,Magda Seguin,That is not how tenders work
1561130735208738,2:42:36,Anne M.,"@Danie Nilsen It might cost you some work in future, but you have kept your name."
1561130741152318,2:42:42,Bernard Matolino,But who is this van Wyk guy?
1561130761895006,2:43:02,Born free,Is this witness a volunteer or was she supeoned??
1561130768023585,2:43:09,Magda Seguin,Van Wyk was from SA Express
1561130785539831,2:43:26,Mzalwane Mzala,There are many registered businesses out there by people who had dreams but could not get work.
1561130798812670,2:43:39,Anne M.,He was General Manager Commercial at SA Express
1561130838684748,2:44:20,Magda Seguin,You are right @Anne M his name was mentioned with the grounding of SA Express
1561130842611115,2:44:23,Bernard Matolino,But the Deputy Chief Justice is asking some tough questions that make this lady's story very shaky. How do you just sign coz you trust someone? Even if my wife were to bring me something I'd check it
1561130858787791,2:44:40,Mzalwane Mzala,I want to listen to her recordings of Van Wyk
1561130889743302,2:45:11,Danie Nilsen,lol it did cost me some short time but then an coulerd friend asked me to become his partner as we were in the same type of construction. i think it was the only time a white partner
1561130890004920,2:45:11,Born free,I can understand why my luggage had been tampered with 🤤
1561130898477660,2:45:20,Mzalwane Mzala,Please trust your wife @Lex Luger
1561130904681075,2:45:25,Some guy,my wife makes me sign documents in my sleep.
1561130930021727,2:45:52,Magda Seguin,Read my lips @Lex Luger criminals go for the vulnerable and those who are not aware of their rights.According to her he was in authority and she believed and trusted him implicitly
1561130952722442,2:46:14,Born free,@some guy... haha Insurance policy
1561130959088550,2:46:19,Kearabetswe Ntsane,yep as I said
1561130978356785,2:46:40,Some guy,lol oh yeah.
1561130992942824,2:46:53,Phillip Cwazibe,This poor women was taken advantage of.
1561130996977400,2:46:58,Magda Seguin,"Read between the lines,her testimony explained his modus operandi he was forever rushing her and had excuses not to answer her questions"
1561131003916265,2:47:05,Bernard Matolino,Guys you can't even trust your mother's daughter/son. Listen to the deputy chief justice's questions. This lady is not as naive as she is making out
1561131008109090,2:47:10,Magda Seguin,He is an effing criminal
1561131020555510,2:47:22,Magda Seguin,I am getting so angry now
1561131026689595,2:47:27,Kearabetswe Ntsane,poor lady man 💔
1561131041676951,2:47:42,Danie Nilsen,"got in as a bee partner my senior was coulerd person in the company up to this day i still do not get it right and he was on the state procurement list and i was not on the list, wich was fine"
1561131081128332,2:48:21,Bernard Matolino,This lady is stammering now. Her story is not convincing. Under thorough cross examination she will fumble
1561131095450898,2:48:36,Magda Seguin,@Lex Luger you need to learn discernment and analytical skills rather than criticising the witness
1561131129858820,2:49:11,Magda Seguin,Any fool can hear that this lady was conned
1561131138113085,2:49:19,Bernard Matolino,Thanks @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ I can never be as naive as this lady esp when doing business. She thinks she is so likeable van Wyk just liked her so much
1561131163668656,2:49:44,Born free,It's all fishy
1561131178827626,2:49:59,Bernard Matolino,@Magda Seguin Just listen to the deputy chief justice. There is an experienced lawyer there. Not you and I
1561131182369982,2:50:03,Magda Seguin,The DCJ must ask pertinent questions to protect her when it goes to court
1561131198772175,2:50:19,Kearabetswe Ntsane,sounds like a classic scam
1561131209154785,2:50:30,Magda Seguin,@Lex Luger you dont know my background.Sit down
1561131232096328,2:50:53,Magda Seguin,Exactly it's a monumental scam
1561131244382412,2:51:05,Mzalwane Mzala,Her only experience is as a subcontractor in delivering meat. Did she ever get a construction tender?
1561131249132628,2:51:10,Bernard Matolino,This lady sees the trouble she is in and she decides let me make it van Wyk's story. It's pretty much like me trusting you guys. I don't know you. You could be killers.
1561131260251798,2:51:21,Kearabetswe Ntsane,trust is deadly hey
1561131284624292,2:51:45,Born free,Trust leafs

1561131288818777,2:51:50,Ben Cole,The crookery and deceit goes beyond any bounds of reason. Naitivity and blind trust in people of authority at any level had got us where we are today.
1561131290213543,2:51:52,Magda Seguin,@Lex Luger it's your perogative but dont make assumptions on who we are
1561131306586227,2:52:07,Born free,Trust leads to Betrayal
1561131312059281,2:52:13,Bernard Matolino,@goolamv you are right

1561131385145731,2:53:26,Bernard Matolino,@Magda Seguin You misunderstand me. All I am saying is that it is imprudent to trust a stranger. Just like those ladies who hand their babies to strangers at taxi ranks and the strangers run.
1561131386420399,2:53:27,Khaya Nomoyi,It seems like she was being pushed under pressure and the cotract was lucrative.
1561131395815110,2:53:37,Magda Seguin,"I work with people everyday of my life in their most intimate lives,this lady was conned and scammed.I read her body language,voice and her answers"
1561131408071738,2:53:49,Danie Nilsen,she puts her foot in it she opens her mouth keep it very short and mostly yes or no
1561131441237181,2:54:22,Born free,R31 million
1561131442196463,2:54:23,Tsepang R,"GREED! The hallmark of all tenderpreneurs! She was just interested in making easy money, that's the bottom line. No regard for proper procedure whatsoever"
1561131442221840,2:54:23,Bernard Matolino,@Magda Seguin You are obviously not after unearthing truth but defending the witness.
1561131462864761,2:54:44,Magda Seguin,"These tenders are usually millions,ho on www.gov.za and research tenders"
1561131495604050,2:55:16,Magda Seguin,I am impartial but I can see a scam a mile away
1561131500259620,2:55:21,Tsepang R,GREED leads us into scams!
1561131539594176,2:56:00,Zola Pinda,The contract is more than R 400m
1561131558840435,2:56:19,Magda Seguin,"Some people in SA always defends corruption,the Zuma crowd especially"
1561131568340857,2:56:29,Bernard Matolino,"@Magda Seguin I am worried why this lady did not see it. I also would not sign even what a colleague hands me, especially in a rush, at 4pm. She is not 5. People were praising her as a hustler"
1561131585022457,2:56:46,Bernard Matolino,A HUSTLER IS NEVER THIS NAIVE
1561131598985130,2:56:59,Magda Seguin,Semantics @Lex Luger
1561131611266590,2:57:12,Bernard Matolino,THIS HUSTLER HAS BEEN BUSTED
1561131650153863,2:57:52,MIKE DURBAN,No...she is acting like she's naive......
1561131660912955,2:58:02,Bernard Matolino,She didnt even know how she was going to be paid. Easy picking for a half baked lawyer
1561131664628565,2:58:04,Derick Mampuru,"I just came online but I can tell this woman is confused, who's she anyway?"
1561131676698617,2:58:18,Magda Seguin,Whatever @Lex Luger
1561131695879056,2:58:36,Bernard Matolino,"@Derick Mampuru She is not confused, she is sweating under tough questioning"
1561131710584094,2:58:51,Zola Pinda,She can Bank the millions in her account but can’t read the contract.
1561131737413818,2:59:19,MIKE DURBAN,"@Lex Luger ,,,spot on.."
1561131746392956,2:59:27,Magda Seguin,Who knows whether she recieved the millions? Why is she here?
1561131748448960,2:59:29,Bernard Matolino,@Magda Seguin Is she your connection? Were you also in the scam? They will arrest you!!
1561131766817071,2:59:48,Zola Pinda,I think she playing games.
1561131777330084,2:59:58,Kevin Simon,"Her business was identified, hijacked and looted under her nose."
1561131780351031,3:00:01,Anne M.,The agmt was envisaged to move R400 million out of North West gvnmt into SA Express and a third party that SA Express nominated to conduct ground-handling services at those airports named Koroneka.
1561131789758120,3:00:10,Derick Mampuru,@Lex Luger lol I thought she doesn't know what she's talking about... 🤣🤣🤣🤣 look at her glasses lol
1561131791576901,3:00:12,MIKE DURBAN,@Thando Nkutha ...spot on...she's acting dumb..
1561131799505062,3:00:20,Magda Seguin,"This needs to be put in context,it is STILL part of the SAA corruption investigation but it is lost on some people on this thread"
1561131806490799,3:00:27,Anne M.,R97 million of that amount was paid out of the North West government and siphoned off through a “detailed scheme of money laundering”
1561131821788568,3:00:42,Daniella Morgan,ooohhh uhuh
1561131827298611,3:00:48,Zola Pinda,She is trying to avoid jail.
1561131828677656,3:00:50,Magda Seguin,Arrest me? Dont patronise me
1561131839485751,3:01:00,Bernard Matolino,"@Derick Mampuru Exactly, those glasses, you can't con any gogo who does that with her glasses.😁😁😁"
1561131895921801,3:01:57,MIKE DURBAN,No no Chair......she knows....
1561131925354612,3:02:26,Zola Pinda,She’s lying😂😂
1561131939049902,3:02:41,Kevin Simon,Contracts equal money for nothing.
1561131939195603,3:02:41,Magda Seguin,"@Anne M your friend @Lex Luger needs to read and be informed about this commission and why it exists,especially who are whistleblowers and who is subpoenaed"
1561131958883387,3:02:59,Tsepang R,typical tenderpreneur. just signs documents and waits for easy ANC millions
1561131993495382,3:03:35,Born free,The players are all connected. She is acting naive
1561131995485099,3:03:37,lesego gareth,She is lying....
1561131999424905,3:03:40,MIKE DURBAN,@Tsepang Ranneileng ...spot on Bra...
1561132010608579,3:03:52,Chalwe Mwansa,this woman is presenting the front of ignorant. She totally knew the guys where using her company and she was going to get a share without her physically doing to day-to-day stress of doing business
1561132013805456,3:03:54,Bernard Matolino,@Magda Seguin Unfortunately I am illiterate. I can't read or write. Happy Now? Yes you won!!
1561132015166786,3:03:56,Magda Seguin,That R400m was stolen
1561132015943156,3:03:56,Zola Pinda,She said she’s done construction tenders for government before.
1561132041822028,3:04:24,Bernard Matolino,and supplied meat
1561132069195908,3:04:51,Mzalwane Mzala,I don't think she ever won a big tender like construction.
1561132085158104,3:05:06,Derick Mampuru,"okay let me listen some more, this is interesting... doing a job yet not knowing how you'll be paid hmm 🤔🤔"
1561132087110054,3:05:08,Chalwe Mwansa,they knew through that hence they just wanted to use her company
1561132100480659,3:05:21,Mzalwane Mzala,She had two companies what were tendering for government contracts
1561132114110567,3:05:35,MIKE DURBAN,Please Chair .......she's playing you......
1561132136346145,3:05:57,Mzalwane Mzala,Kunjalo Thando
1561132152010163,3:06:13,Chalwe Mwansa,she probably even right the proposal herself
1561132165095017,3:06:26,Chalwe Mwansa,write*
1561132173342093,3:06:33,Kevin Simon,The only reason she agreed is because this system worked before.
1561132175167926,3:06:35,Zola Pinda,Yes🤣🤣
1561132180189658,3:06:41,Magda Seguin,She is what is called a 'patsy' the fall guy for malicious purposes
1561132187595219,3:06:48,Mzalwane Mzala,Vuka mawulele
1561132209569231,3:07:11,Bernard Matolino,When you supp with the devil you must use a long fork.
1561132245869444,3:07:47,Derick Mampuru,@Thando Nkutha my point exactly lol
1561132255194508,3:07:55,Chalwe Mwansa,ultimately she was told for every money that comes into your account you get x-percentage
1561132315684644,3:08:57,Zola Pinda,She had a drive and van loader for her meat delivery in hospitals later end up with close a half a billion. Pathetic
1561132341824853,3:09:22,Francois Cape Town,"Liar,Liar, Pants on fire..."
1561132361308119,3:09:42,Bernard Matolino,"@Mzalwane Mzala It is this belief, which was funny at the beginning of her testimony. Believing that one is blessed is dangerous. She thought she was so blessed and she is no different from blessees"
1561132372687636,3:09:54,Mzalwane Mzala,@Zola Pinda That is exactly the issue
1561132383974816,3:10:04,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,"This woman is lying. She should have had relations with the then Premier and was co-corrupt, hence she never questioned this deal. Supra only worked with his people."
1561132397181729,3:10:18,Mzalwane Mzala,@Lex Luger I get you.
1561132402713211,3:10:23,Zola Pinda,Yes
1561132419807805,3:10:41,Bernard Matolino,"A blessee thinks she is so lucky, she gets used, is discarded and she cries crocodile tears"
1561132441689438,3:11:02,Zola Pinda,R400m no contract 😣😣
1561132458999074,3:11:20,Mzalwane Mzala,Many people who work in government find themselves in such relationships.
1561132484896809,3:11:46,Bernard Matolino,A break at 6? What time are they adjourning?
1561132513281694,3:12:14,Zola Pinda,This is very sad for us as tax payers. These looters must go rot in jail
1561132534538392,3:12:35,Bernard Matolino,@Thando Nkutha I like this slender but would have loved Maleka or Hofmeyer
1561132541508862,3:12:42,Chalwe Mwansa,you will now see how quick the money was exiting her account
1561132551953086,3:12:53,Chalwe Mwansa,to show she was just a conduit
1561132559489297,3:13:00,Kevin Simon,"With all this going on, why would there be any foreign direct investment? This is hugely embarrassing to RSA!"

1561132639787089,3:14:20,Bernard Matolino,@HERCULAAS KRUGER You are absolutely right. This judge's work ethic is absolutely wonderful. He was in parliament yesterday and he is making up for it today. Where are our parliamentarians today?
1561132649456601,3:14:31,j b,why was she in business?
1561132668797244,3:14:49,Zola Pinda,To loot
1561132686033705,3:15:06,Bernard Matolino,@Danie Nilsen This lady would sell her soul and her grandmother's feet for a pound!!!
1561132690029625,3:15:12,Magda Seguin,"From the start of this commission it is very clear how peoples lives were destroyed by the Zuptoids they had a specific strategy.People used,abused,forced to resign,death threats and more."
1561132694618378,3:15:15,HERCULAAS KRUGER,Absolutely Lex !!!! We need more of his type in our country !!!
1561132710720203,3:15:31,Magda Seguin,If you are not on the side of justice you are complicit
1561132752629839,3:16:13,Bernard Matolino,@Magda Seguin There you go with your erudite platitudes
1561132951508208,3:19:32,Mzalwane Mzala,Check how JZ operated: Give a senior job to a person who will know that they would have never got it without your intervention. Such a person agrees to everything you say
1561132970078593,3:19:52,Danie Nilsen,she said she signed for millions eish man throw me a Belss and one for the chair too
1561133002494996,3:20:23,Mzalwane Mzala,This lady knew that she owed Van Wyk for that contract and could not question him.

1561133187205013,3:23:28,Mzalwane Mzala,@Thando Nkutha I don't think she was consciously being criminal but she let go of ethics in order to get the big money. Unfortunately for her she was dealing with a bigger tsotsi.
1561133201464138,3:23:42,Ntokozo Dube,"i think she knew what she was getting into, she was part of the syndicate but not used"
1561133214696283,3:23:55,Danie Nilsen,"i d not know i know how to spend and more, while the rest of her people are jobless and hungry why is our country so full of crime it is hungry people stealing and she correct the judge lol"
1561133239964258,3:24:20,Mzalwane Mzala,She was used and she allowed herself to be used.
1561133282143424,3:25:03,Mzalwane Mzala,Lesson: Always follow processes.
1561133325525304,3:25:48,Ntokozo Dube,Exactly
