1551691117638270,1:21:53,Lawrence Maswabi,Just tuned in after being loadshed. Thanks to Eskom
1551691158732365,1:22:33,Francoise Phillips,Time we start calling loadshedding what it really is: black outs.
1551691167261304,1:22:41,Stephan Dolk,something smells of BS
1551691177167579,1:22:51,Francoise Phillips,Time we call state capture what it is: ANC looting of our state.
1551691233888274,1:23:48,Francoise Phillips,So this should really be a commission on inquiry into how the ANC looted our state.
1551691588200380,1:29:42,Felix Muyoba,I for one think loadshedding is apartheid product because the capacity of eskom was just designed for the few and now the masses also want energy and therefore the capacity is insufficeint..
1551692113843273,1:38:28,Carl Theunissen,@Felix Muyoba The management of Eskom warned the government still in the time of Mbeki that they should start to build more power stations. They didn't listen. Mbeki later said government was wrong.
1551692284083754,1:41:18,Jack Sparrow,"@Felix Muyoba Nope. Eskom generates less electricity now than they did then, and at about 6 times the cost. Can't blame apartheid"
1551692340760631,1:42:14,Joel Mzayidume,@JS Bach you're right. it's ANC's fault
1551692395744742,1:43:10,Felix Muyoba,@JS Bach and @Joel Mzayidume you guys are wrong!!
1551692443727895,1:43:58,Carl Theunissen,"Have you read that article, Felix?"
1551692470680545,1:44:24,Joel Mzayidume,@Felix Muyoba what is stated by @JS Bach is recorded fact.
1551692496676937,1:44:51,Jack Sparrow,but don't let facts get in the way of your predjudice
1551692497368696,1:44:52,Felix Muyoba,@Jack Sparrow those guys who ran it (eskom) then were short sighted..they were not following the strat plan..all they were interested in are bonuses..
1551692532859208,1:45:26,Felix Muyoba,@Joel Mzayidume no man..factual incorrect..
1551692597595688,1:46:32,Jack Sparrow,@Felix Muyoba In 1998 Eskom predicted that demand would outstrip supply in 2008. The ANC was too busy feeding at the trough to take notice. And then in 2008 we ran out of juice
1551692603836222,1:46:38,Carl Theunissen,But it was the guys at Eskom who told Mbeki to to build more power stations?? It was the ANC government that didn't want to! I don't understand your bonuses story.
1551692624723624,1:46:58,Melamu Izzo Mokoena,m
1551692625131580,1:46:58,Joel Mzayidume,@Felix Muyoba no problem stick with what you believe in.
1551692666025266,1:47:40,Carl Theunissen,Mabuza is happy that there are people like Felix that fall for their stories.
1551692717755910,1:48:31,Jack Sparrow,@JS Bach But you can't deny that Donald Trump was caused by apartheid
1551692727428482,1:48:42,Felix Muyoba,@Jack Sparrow understood but what happened to the profits eskom accummulated before then? why didnt they use that to expand eskom capacity instead of asking gvt?
1551692826807112,1:50:20,Carl Theunissen,"@Jack Sparrow I'm agreeing with you - my comment starting with ""But it was the guys"" was aimed at Felix. Can't stand DT, by the way...."
1551692833104866,1:50:28,Felix Muyoba,remember gvt has other more pressing social responsibilities to attend to
1551692842333217,1:50:36,Joel Mzayidume,@Felix Muyoba how much profit was that? Remember Eskom was funding the electrification of black people's homes. New build required serious money from Treasury
1551692848461731,1:50:42,Jack Sparrow,@Felix Muyoba any build programme would be subject to approval by the government. Eskom couldn't go it alone
1551692857038670,1:50:51,Frik Brits,"#Jack Sparrow , Donald Trump caused by apartheid ??? HUH how ??"
1551692861445853,1:50:55,Tommy Anderson,SA government is finished under ANC

1551692931716811,1:52:05,Eslon Eslon,Deputy president dd Mabuza once said loadshadding is a sign of growth of eskom

1551694188291565,2:13:02,Tommy Anderson,"If the blacks are so powerful, why do they need BEE and A-action against a minority? How weak are you?"
1551694235082468,2:13:49,Tommy Anderson,"The ANC stole so much money that the government is crippled, hows that for stealing?"
1551694251398851,2:14:05,Joy Dikgale,"@Tommy Anderson, Eskom never had load shedding in your areas because it was delivering services mainly to white, coloured, and indian, but, we ALWAYS had load shedding."

1551694465222873,2:17:39,Joy Dikgale,"@Tommy, I grew up in the 80's, and I was sent monthly by my grandmother to pay electricity, It's ok Tommy, keep pretending that things were better for ALL during apartheid, it helps you sleep better."
1551694488714245,2:18:03,Tommy Anderson,"The last 25 years was a lie and look for yourself what is happening. In order for something to be able to be broken down, someone must have built it in the first place, namely whites"
1551694499168179,2:18:13,Bridgette Kekana,who killed Chris Hani it is a white man who pulled the trigger

1551695979408214,2:42:54,Reuben Trotter,Casting blame at the past does not deal with the present challenges. The reality has to be dealt with. It really seems as if there isn't a real will to solve this issue.
1551695994873432,2:43:09,M T,Seems others must use their prerogative - Bridgette üòè
1551696040392905,2:43:55,Tommy Anderson,"If they can only see the solution, not create another problem to cover up the failures and blame it all on whites and apartheid"

1551696106403519,2:45:01,M T,#Tommy - I can only agree to your last comment

1551696197023111,2:46:30,Tommy Anderson,I dont cover up what I feel by blaming other of my own mistakes
1551696266374647,2:47:41,Nivan N,have to say something . . . how on earth can a ONE MAN (Zondo Commission) come to any conclusion in this SAGA . . . This is a TOTAL waste of Time & Money.
1551696393742433,2:49:48,Tommy Anderson,"The Zondo Commission is talking on behalf of a board of directors, having a list of points to stick to, making arguements but forcing their points across. They are all still the same corrupt entity."
1551696424022092,2:50:18,Tommy Anderson,"No solid conclusions will be reaches here today, as usual."
1551696430057257,2:50:24,Nivan N,The commission is working off SIU reports that these people have made years ago . . why through a commission . . . this should all be tested in the Highest Courts with a Panel . . . not a ONE MAN sho
1551696464568467,2:50:59,Tommy Anderson,That is a valid suggestion yes
1551696493054886,2:51:26,Tommy Anderson,They should be tried in the High Court

1551696531676481,2:52:05,Tommy Anderson,"Yes its true,"
1551696534321224,2:52:08,Anne M.,"@Nivan N No, they are not only working off old SIU reports. This commission has it's own investigators and they are submitting information through the commission advocates."
1551696634749790,2:53:48,Bridgette Kekana,@Tommy n u too must b tried in high bcos of your racism
1551696656104663,2:54:10,Tommy Anderson,"Yose Human Not all whites brought indians in as sugar cane slaves, thank your British friends for that okay. For 25 years this was the land of equal opportunity, why are blacks still impoverished?"
1551696766016329,2:56:00,Tommy Anderson,"If you deny this, you deny written facts"
1551696856948582,2:57:31,Joel Mzayidume,Sthule siyabuka nje
1551697041655125,3:00:36,Tommy Anderson,"Our team never lost, we stepped down to see what the other team had to offer. Clearly SA is a much darker place to live in for all, not only whites, everybody is feeling your failures."
1551697047513193,3:00:42,Anne M.,"@Thando Nkutha Aha, I found out who the witness is - Corporate Specialist: Funding Execution in the Treasury Department at Eskom, Mr. Sincedile Ebenezer Shweni. The commission has it's own website."
