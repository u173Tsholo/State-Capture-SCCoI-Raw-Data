1598343660238518,15:37,Nicollette Ferguson,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THE FACT THAT THE WORLD IS WATCHING, CONTINUE WITH YOUR CORRUPTION SA!!!!"
1598343724569086,16:43,makhosi nobhatyi,"Yes Agrizzi, Nomvula Mokonyane came here to lie"
1598343753411627,17:12,Maxwell Sibiya,Evidence leader did a opening statement. Chair decided to show him how it's done.
1598343817231227,18:14,Akhona Gala,This evidence leader and that white old lady are not the best in the business bayantantazela
1598343855324260,18:52,Jan Kruger,I'm surprised the chairman so calm when he was told two persons are excused for today. Usely he's serious and talk about the little time that's left for the work of the commission.
1598343865501121,19:04,Maxwell Sibiya,"@Akhona, what happened to Adv Maleka? I miss him"
1598343961945473,20:40,Quinton Ndzinisa,greetings all
1598343975198600,20:53,Quinton Ndzinisa,who is testifying today?
1598344011892631,21:28,Akhona Gala,"@Max I'm not sure where is he, i see they made some few changes. Adv Maleka and Hofmeyr are surely one of the best in the country..."
1598344020435895,21:37,Kevin Simon,Passive aggressive witness
1598344023644043,21:42,Esme Van Heerden,"@Maxwell Sibiya yes, Adv Maleka is our very own Sydney Poitier"
1598344074291387,22:32,Siviwe Ratsibe,Witness full of attitude
1598344076160592,22:34,Tom Thumb,@Maxwell Adv Malake has gone back to private practice to make more money from this thieves:yougotthis:
1598344107986266,23:06,Vanita-Joy Meyer,She initially worked in the kitchen!!
1598344125491838,23:22,Nicollette Ferguson,it's not a long list 😂😂
1598344126710926,23:23,Nkululeko Njapha,so?
1598344126973431,23:24,Maxwell Sibiya,@Quinton We dealing with Bosasa today. about 3 witnesses expected. 2 already skipped us today
1598344161936268,24:00,Sifiso Kheswa,There's a head on collision between the Evidence Leader and The Chair
1598344186402262,24:24,Vanita-Joy Meyer,Definitely Sifiso! They both seem to want to lead the evidence
1598344189679717,24:27,Asanda Dikela Twala,"lol we going to have a long Day, with this Madala evidence Leader."
1598344200702451,24:37,Maxwell Sibiya,@Garth if that's the case. the commission missed out on a great Adv.
1598344226993687,25:04,keresemese mofokeng simon,I wish NPA could utilize Ad Hoffmeyer to be their one of prosecutors to prosecute the state capture criminals.
1598344244825649,25:22,Sifiso Kheswa,Vanita I think it's a competence issue. I feel the chair doesn't have faith in the evidence leader
1598344246844286,25:24,Nicollette Ferguson,Letter of appointment?
1598344364761191,27:23,Maxwell Sibiya,"The questions might be the same, statements might be the same, but the line of questioning from Adv. Maleka and Adv Hofmeyr it's amazing. Others I sometimes loose concentration"
1598344394207152,27:52,Akhona Gala,"shame Ms Dube looks scared, Zondo must calm her down with his deep voice.... Mr Notshes voice is scaring her. when she's answering Zondo she's smiling shame uSisi"
1598344435351177,28:32,Vanita-Joy Meyer,Yes Sifiso thats why the chair was providing guidance
1598344528777860,30:06,Maxwell Sibiya,"Once the chair start asking questions himself like this, it shows the evidence leader is missing something..."
1598344550167631,30:28,Esme Van Heerden,"@Akhona Gala true, it must be very frightening"
1598344585213779,31:03,Akhona Gala,🤣🤣

1598345021940098,38:19,khuthadzo moji,I think this witness was supposed to have evidence on her home language then have interpreter.. I think things was gonna flow
1598345037768298,38:35,Justin Damons,"Its the nerves, shame"

1598345679287839,49:15,Akhona Gala,"@Sidney 😂😂 enough there's a new witness on stage now, let's concentrate chief"
1598345741345729,50:19,Margareth Waterboer,@Melor Hadebe I agree with you. The chats on here focus on irrelevant observations instead of the evidence given. And she gives away very important facts implicating the big fish.
1598345775468458,50:53,Solutions SA,@Akhona Gala Very codescending of you. Now yiu dont like the evidence leader but sympathetic with witnesses
1598345812321734,51:30,Angel Mtshali,At some point it came across as though Ms Dube could and wanted to say more but either the nerves or the language stood in her way. Anyways ke sizwe the new witness.
1598345819551008,51:38,Siyanda Sithole,The evidence leader has never been this happy 😃😃

1598345999585509,54:37,Ramogale Selebogo,This is so useless
1598346040463509,55:17,Singi Mathebula,we are lead by liars 🙈
1598346073185094,55:51,Akhona Gala,ok sorry Sidney i withdraw continue to attack Ms Dube. It was very brave of her to come to the commission and i think she did much better than Zuma interms of answering Q's
1598346121578117,56:38,Asanda Dikela Twala,lol am not saying anything but yeeeeeeey Evidence Leader buvuliwe mkhuluwa wam.

1598346316629428,59:54,Kieron Sinewave,Events organizers do that XD
1598346366064774,1:00:44,Solutions SA,@Angel Mtshali Not tax but Bosasa bribery

1598346763961556,1:07:21,Solutions SA,He can't do anything @Kevin Nit when Ace is SG
1598346768797868,1:07:27,Angel Mtshali,@Martha Motuba: Those orange overalls are for mere mortals like us. sadly.
1598346819724169,1:08:17,Martha Motuba,"who is this man (with own hairstyle) just came now, what is he???"
1598346823063185,1:08:21,Derek Govender,With all this evidence why is Mokhanyane not being handcuffed and taken to a police holding cell as she lied under oath??
1598346847193453,1:08:45,Solutions SA,loooool😂😂😂😂 Mortals like us ??? @Angel Mtshali
1598346932505184,1:10:12,Martin Radebe,Don't forget y'all that this gossip has already cost taxpayers R1 billion.
1598346939447347,1:10:18,Monnakgomo Lekganyane,Mara this Ms Dube was a poor witness hle...she doesn’t really follow. She often jumps before the gun 😨
1598346944867239,1:10:23,Angel Mtshali,@Derek Govender : Arrests don't happen for those people. It's court cases and appeals!!!
1598346980012261,1:10:58,Derek Govender,@Angel the question is WHY SO???
1598347037102290,1:11:56,Solutions SA,Tea break Aii Today's witnesses are boring
1598347044595881,1:12:03,Vanita-Joy Meyer,@Angel Mtshali unfortunately that is true
1598347073922216,1:12:31,Angel Mtshali,Was bout to say!!! I need a break too @ Sidney P
1598347081596920,1:12:39,Thabo Mokoaleli,"All these ZuGupta Nexus are habitually pathological Liars. Zuma refuted everything, MamaAction refuted that no birthday of hers to place at this guesthouse and Sodi claimed not to know initials AC🙈😅"
1598347107723745,1:13:05,Solutions SA,He is finished too Aiii Waste of resources
1598347127130597,1:13:25,Wildthing,Mr Lana haircut should have some photos too of the guests. or we can hunt Facebook for her friends.
1598347143183694,1:13:41,Wildthing,Lama.
1598347195001911,1:14:32,Derek Govender,Surely there must be photographs taken at that function
1598347222717417,1:15:00,Angel Mtshali,Ms Dube could have done this too but the chair and language!!!!
1598347226244082,1:15:03,Solutions SA,Bosasa paid for Nomvula's birthday party. I wonder how she will argue this one
1598347302724830,1:16:20,Derek Govender,@sidney P she already appeared before Zondo but lied through her teeth like all ANC members from Cyril down
1598347309013447,1:16:27,Solutions SA,Cross examination of Mokonyane will be very interesting
1598347355981164,1:17:14,Solutions SA,@Derek Govender she must appear to clarify this revelations
1598347363092509,1:17:20,Martha Motuba,"@Angel Mtshali and Derek Govender Mokonyane said they will pick up a rand when our economy was downgraded, typical educated iiterate😵😵😷"
1598347448308867,1:18:45,Ndaxola Mdrai,hopefully there will be few of those who attended the party who will be coming to collaborate this testimony otherwise it is just a waste of time. or cross examination will give much more insight
1598347476645834,1:19:14,Derek Govender,@Sidney P but if you or myself lied we would have been behind BARS by now right!!!
1598347716299698,1:23:15,Angel Mtshali,A cross examination is much needed here.
1598347783919672,1:24:22,khuthadzo moji,Mrs Thomas don't Wana come to the commission
