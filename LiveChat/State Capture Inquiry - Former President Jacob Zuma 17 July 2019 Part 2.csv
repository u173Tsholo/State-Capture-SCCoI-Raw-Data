1563368149562080,47:26,Ketelo Asanda,"Well, look at it this way - At the end, the commission will still give us a report of its findings, that will happen with or without Zuma but as things stand his name will be on that report."

1563368167452696,47:43,Sofia Sofia,I think towards the end of the day the Muti fades away .....
1563368170315818,47:46,Ketelo Asanda,I hope he takes the right decision here. A president for 2 terms and you do not remember anything.
1563368172292171,47:48,Ketelo Asanda,This man needs to use this platform to say something clear and to the point. I for one do not know what he knows and it's been 3 days.
1563368176551923,47:53,Tebogo V,and by the way the Sipho Maseko Zuma rejected is what in Black Consciousness we call a TOWER

1563368280591632,49:36,barry lamont,hey Gerald Buekes we want you standing outside the commission venue with a placard supporting so we can see who you are..
1563368283400782,49:39,Phelelani Gambu,By the look of things DCJ Zondo will be coming to indefinitely adjourn the proceedings...
1563368285721943,49:41,Eddie Taukobong,"Jabu, it's better to watch it than to hear someone's point of view about what transpired therein"
1563368286602392,49:42,Jabu Malinga,zondo wil decide who is lying. he wil make recommendations and zuma wil go to court . another 10 years wil pass. zuma wil die and then? all this money?

1563368294828477,49:51,Magda Seguin,A President of 9 years cant account for his tenure...tragic
1563368296649479,49:53,Born free,I guarantee they are done with the questions and Zondo will have to issue a subpoena.
1563368296797557,49:53,Frans Du Plessis,Criminal movements hang them

1563368329884246,50:26,Tebogo V,"Check Sipho Maseko's background he is a TOWER, an ethically upright and examplary black leadership following in steps of Biko"
1563368334101289,50:30,Jabu Malinga,he is too clever for that
1563368351947171,50:49,Xolani Rawutini,Zuma's lawyers it was their strategy before he attend the commission to interrupt the chairman so that he must lose focus.
1563368352688280,50:50,Pumeza Mnguni,You cant force an innocent man to admit guilt
1563368357099493,50:53,Sindiswa Moolman,Zuma is not coming back... I can assure you. The chair must use his powers and subpoena him to finish his testimony qha.
1563368358261512,50:54,Antonie Goosen,Only the guilty is afraid of giving testimony
1563368359089821,50:55,Jabu Malinga,either zuma is lying or Barbara Hogan is lying. take your pic..

1563368365798048,51:02,Magda Seguin,Zuma said the Guptas are his close friends and nobody can do anything about that...they deserted him and is having multi million dollar marriages
1563368367488167,51:04,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Yep - he can see he is trapped and wants out.
1563368374227197,51:11,Dominic Przybylski,Zuma will be going to Dubai very soon.
1563368379922923,51:16,şandile fakude,this Tebogo guy is in the payroll of Rupperts you see that he is talking media politics
1563368381308262,51:17,Jabu Malinga,zondo wil not supena him
1563368383879994,51:20,Flight Mate,Return Flights to Durban from R 600!
1563368384134096,51:20,Pastor J.J,@Rainy Moodley In the case of Zuma it is and must be guilty until proven innocent. the allegations are overwhelming is it not?
1563368384673979,51:20,Thato Thulare,So what exactly is he here for? Coz everything here seems to implicate him in some way. I'm struggling to understand which questions are appropriate for this man

1563368390080394,51:26,Jabu Malinga,they wil not force him to do anytin.

1563368408189312,51:44,Jabu Malinga,zondo cannot act in 1 interest over another
1563368409585730,51:46,Nonto Ngubane,has Zuma been charged? last i was here it an inquiry what is going on people

1563368419630047,51:55,Njabulo Mashinini,Why its impossible to bring guptas into this inquiry?
1563368420718930,51:56,citizendc9,Statistically Zuma is guilty. There are so many other charges pending against him. He can't be innocent of all 100.
1563368421451077,51:57,Andre Gerber,"When things gets too hoooot, rruuuunnnnnnnnnn"
1563368425321456,52:02,Lynette Mamashela,They must allow him to spill the beans first and then do the questioning after. Time is running out
1563368425547086,52:02,Jabu Malinga,zondo wil hav to do what zuma wants
1563368443517142,52:20,Dominic Przybylski,Dubai - The quick sprint to freedom.

1563368464005878,52:40,Jabu Malinga,"if zuma does not want to answer, zondo can do nothing about that, but when he finds against zuma, zuma cannot say he did not get a chance to giv his side"
1563368468868033,52:46,Magda Seguin,Zuma made all those who implicated him out to be liars...he is pathetic playing the victim.He ruined the lives of lots of honest folks and messed with the future if generations to come
1563368469959728,52:47,Sofia Sofia,he is going to come back and say I AM BRAIN DEAD
1563368476765288,52:53,Lynette Mamashela,Skhakhane tried to discredit the commission and it backfired
1563368476836681,52:53,Howard Hughes,Zuma must go and live in Dubai. He will just be remembered as a traitor to his own country.
