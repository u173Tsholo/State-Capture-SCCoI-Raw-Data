1538558532300648,1:14:33,Maanda Manyatshe,No..the refinery was being bought by Petrosa...so it was going to be a national asset....it was actually not a bad idea except for the fact that we wanted to pay 2X its value...overpriced that is
1538558564356893,1:15:05,Khalid Mather,"take a look at Operation Phakisa, which has a lot to do with Petroleum production. Big Oil rules the world (Engen == ExxonMobil)"
1538558636001788,1:16:16,Maanda Manyatshe,Engen= Petronas ......Mobil sold long time ago in 1992/93......

1538561537980143,2:04:38,makhosi nobhatyi,If EFF has all information must come forward not to make an accusation which is baseless they do so to gain more votes
1538561571423525,2:05:12,ntokozo vincent Sikakane,why is Nene reading his answers something fishy
1538561609224804,2:05:50,Ashwyn Watkins,EFF must bring the evidence... one cannot make allegations and not have the proof ... We want all these corrupt individuals exposed
1538561679317957,2:07:00,Makho Theo,Actually we can ... its the Fraud we cant. Im an Electrical Power System Engineer i can assure its the Audits were Rigged

1538561891609259,2:10:32,Frank M,Nooo That EFF of yours think are smarter than who. What about their Dark secret.
1538562138633983,2:14:39,Ashwyn Watkins,Renewable and alternative energy is so much cheaper than nuclear... But nuclear is required... a mixed energy grid would be great especially because fossil fuel is really expensive...
1538562244303646,2:16:24,Keith Williams,nuclear energy produces nuclear waste. SA should stay away from nuclear energy. They missed the bullet with the apartheid regime acquisition of nuclear weapons from Israel to wipe out Africa.
1538562347251884,2:18:08,Paul de Bruyn,This whole excersize has a main objective. To allocate so called consultation fees worth millions. Its a blatant attemot to syphen out more state funds!!

1538562408917921,2:19:09,ross claassens,Will there be a conclusion that resolves this issue
1538562451725908,2:19:52,Keith Williams,No it is not. The world is moving in the direction of non nuclear renewable energy.
1538562473534495,2:20:14,Thiza William,Anyone in possession of incrementing evidence to Nene present it to the Judge or forever shut up with gossips
1538562510371016,2:20:51,Keith Williams,Read. I wrote that it would be presented as that. I did not say that blacks were incompetent.
1538562548979559,2:21:29,Mulunghisi Hlengani,"if minister and former president Zuma are are attacking each other like this, where are they putting South Africa to?"
1538562570584358,2:21:51,Paul de Bruyn,there are cheaper and bio friendly mesathods of energy production. Nuclear is NOT an option!!We have sun and wind as well as water energy generation resources to our advantage. DITCH NUCLEAR POWER!
1538562590285853,2:22:11,Ashwyn Watkins,We moving to electrical vehicles we will need more supply... like I said a mixed source grid will be great for the economy... There is no such thing as black incompetence.. only poor leaders
1538562632648625,2:22:53,Dario Tekle,The Russians have nothing for them self. so how they can build anything in AFRIKA? look at there country.
1538562634228645,2:22:55,Keith Williams,Africa and the Caribbean have the most conducive environments for solar and other forms of energy. We need to stop trying to be clones of the movements of others.
1538562665493328,2:23:26,Makho Theo,"The issue was bypassing Solar especially because it was the most cost effective. but not conducive for labo Chief base Sheeben, Sexon (Sexon is a ggerman world)"
1538562695371178,2:23:56,Keatlaretse Phetwe,So Nhlanhla wasnt fired for not refusing to procure nuclear??
1538562729566435,2:24:30,Keith Williams,What is racism. Racism is the belief in human superiority. Stop echoing the obtuse revision of this practise.
1538562779285532,2:25:20,Keatlaretse Phetwe,So u guys are disappointed??? I told you guys...It doesnt mean you are right just because you are a group???It just makes you a foolish group...
1538562871062585,2:26:51,Thamsanqa Nomayela,If EFF have something they know they must come forward to the Zondo Commission.

1538563982776376,2:45:23,Keatlaretse Phetwe,1. nENE WAS FIRED FOR THE REFINERY DEAL...
1538564006448896,2:45:47,Jeremy Vindiciam Libertatis,"Marxism is a disaster, and you will see."
1538564015442071,2:45:56,sizwe gwala,Are you listening to Nene. He refused to sign a letter to the Russian authorities that SA would not have to pay for the nuclear deal. What was the problem mos?
1538564022620819,2:46:03,Thiza William,Because facts are in front of us and if Zuma is of higher intellect let him appear before the commission or courts to clear his name
1538564030551531,2:46:11,Keatlaretse Phetwe,What facts do u bring MASAMBAG..
1538564044725573,2:46:25,MASAMBAG,but Nene has just told the country why he was fired and why do you dispute that ?
1538564052341972,2:46:33,Ashwyn Watkins,I disagree with you Jeremy

1538564129969902,2:47:50,Thiza William,if you're in possession of facts come before Zondo and subject yourself to cross examination
1538564142581297,2:48:03,Andrew Mc Farlane,Marxism misses a few things. One thing I remember from a scholar of Marxism is that is lacks morals and ethics.
