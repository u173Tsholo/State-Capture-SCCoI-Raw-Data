1552989428689129,2:24:29,funicanz,"@Derek Main . I agree with you 100%.My blood boiled after looking at that list. So Gigaba and Mbalula needed to be ""rehabilitated"" at Luthuli House in order to make their way back to parliament?!"
1552989506155027,2:25:47,Desmond Masilela,Not to waste more money to call the witnesses. The NPA should also come and take their own evidence right here at the commission. take who ever is capture straight to court to be prosecuted.

1552989574280452,2:26:55,funicanz,"@Derrick Busani , I don't think so. We've been waiting for Juffrou Myeni since SABC/ESKOM Commissions to date. She's alive, somewhere and yet she never made it to any inquiry:-)"
1552989634127052,2:27:55,funicanz,I don't even want to mention how's ducked and dived when being called to answer anything linked to SAA.
1552989634458373,2:27:55,Desmond Masilela,@Felix Muyoba. yes. Think about this. The NPA will still call this ppl to give evidence they can simply take notes right here simple.
1552989639848230,2:28:00,Desmond Masilela,to cut the cost
1552989640686171,2:28:01,Anne M.,@funicanz Hiding out at Nkandla?

1552989691192861,2:28:52,funicanz,EFF will take over Limpopo it's just a matter of time.
1552989695537967,2:28:56,Derek Main,@funicanz The less said about the ANC election list the better - it reads like a list from Police File.
1552989715562215,2:29:16,Mzalwane Mzala,They will fight for oppositn with DA
1552989742268977,2:29:43,funicanz,@Derek Main ... Noted Cadre *wink*
1552989836074155,2:31:16,Desmond Masilela,Something is not right here. The Adv is asking question and the witness has got answers written on the paper with page numbers. Why can't they just take the paper and get the answers out the paper.
1552989868202621,2:31:49,Desmond Masilela,from the paper
1552989880393102,2:32:01,Solly 12,Sam men thought the current president has brought in a new kind of hope in the country

1552989917223766,2:32:38,Felix Muyoba,@Sam men that is a revolt and secessionism and not state capture
1552989947221365,2:33:08,Derek Main,@Sam men Sorry to hear about your troubles in Ethiopia but we have enough problems in SA created by our own ANC government to deal with.
1552989982103070,2:33:43,Desmond Masilela,@Derek Main. 😂😂😂😂
1552989983539027,2:33:44,Mzalwane Mzala,The ANC is likely to hold on to Gauteng where the EFF is likely to put up a strong showing.
1552989986599630,2:33:47,Felix Muyoba,@Sam men go to the UN or ICJ please
1552990043413830,2:34:44,Desmond Masilela,@Sam men. Can you please give us some time to resolve our problems here at home. Once we done will come rescue your country.

1552990241269908,2:38:02,Derek Main,"@Sam men As you have probably seen, our ANC government's foreign policy leaves much to be desired. We can't even assist our neighbours Zimbabwe where the criminal ZANU-PF has stolen elections."
1552990251762215,2:38:12,funicanz,@Desmond Masilela 😃 hAYI MAAN 😃 So we will call them?
1552990297799769,2:38:59,Madelein R,"@Mzalwane Mzala I agree with you. The DA started well in WC, but have been slipping up"
