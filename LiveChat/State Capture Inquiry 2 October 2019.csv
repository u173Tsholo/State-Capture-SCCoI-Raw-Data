1570003769558166,55:19,Norman Zwane,@Raymond Mohlamonyane I also have my doubts if you represent all Black people officially. I think you speak only for yourself. Your admiration of Mpofu is quite in order but it is not universal.
1570003810307264,56:00,Raymond Mohlamonyane,@Norman Zwane I dont need any office to represent my people
1570003827245550,56:16,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Carol berry it is bad to be here talk about this issue, this was planned to oust Gordhan back in 2015 coz Gordhan stopped Guptas to enter at treasure"

1570005525638211,1:24:35,Jack Sparrow,@mandisi ntauzana pravin will come across very well under cross examination. and in his court case against the pp. but his objective is to show the middle finger to moyane. i'd do the same
1570005536343599,1:24:46,Kay Kay,Is the Tom Moyane story back again or what?
1570005562097335,1:25:12,Clive White,"That is the point Moyane must speak about his involvement in state capture, at This commission."
1570005568225376,1:25:17,Humani Duncan,"@African Refugee what a stupid thought process you have, this commission has terms of reference and narrow in scope to the specifics. What does Mandela have to do with anything??"
1570005568227892,1:25:17,mandisi ntauzana,Jack i don't think Pravin will survive cross examination.
1570005575250446,1:25:25,Kevin Simon,mandisi ntauzana .. Why does Tom avoid giving evidence? Also at the Nugent Commission?
1570005593188936,1:25:43,Jack Sparrow,"@mandisi ntauzana we will see in his court case against the pp, won't we?"
1570005594407347,1:25:44,Clive White,Now Zondo is beginning to make sense.
1570005597044893,1:25:46,Pastor J.J,@I Am Free I now understand what you are referring to. Thats not a bad idea at all.
1570005623007799,1:26:13,Kevin Simon,Zondo has been brilliant.

1570005645321379,1:26:36,Singi Mathebula,Let Moyana make a submission to the commission before he can be granted leave to cross examine Mr Gordan
1570005652115612,1:26:42,mandisi ntauzana,"Unfortunately the PP case won't have cross examination, the whole case will be dealt with on papers and oral is limited to counsel"

1570005809801382,1:29:20,Mangalani Mangalani,But what is so difficult here? Minister Gordhan has nothing to hide right? Why does he just set aside a day and see what Mr Moyane has?

1570005952727446,1:31:42,Pheladi Lamola,Moyane has no shame at all. To sit there and laugh
1570005956497335,1:31:46,Kay Kay,why not suppose to continue with Mr. Naidoo's testimony today?
1570005972423104,1:32:03,Person of interest,"Moyane, come to Zondo now, we want to hear you..."
1570005982712435,1:32:12,Raven Penny,we wil stay captured

1570006017739154,1:32:47,Derek Main,@Sbo Gumede It's not possible to be more corrupt than the ANC. I agree that all politicians are corrupt but the ANC have taken corruption to another level altogether.
1570006023934968,1:32:54,Kevin Simon,carol berry ‚ÄãIs monyani still in office? NO Where have you been?????!!!!
1570006028316211,1:32:58,Singi Mathebula,Do you think Moyana is different from Zuma?

1570006123863901,1:34:33,Clive White,Zondo is now having to justify himself
1570006124672340,1:34:34,Pastor J.J,This is about Moyane and SARS. Lets not forget that Moyane is deeply implicated in the Bosasa and Correctional Services as well.
1570006132612190,1:34:42,Raven Penny,dismissed or not still eating our money

1570006337753052,1:38:07,Pastor J.J,@Robert Russell Correct 100%. Then he can also explain his role about Bosasa and Correctional Services whilst he was Commissioner
1570006368201332,1:38:38,carol berry,Yes he must be subpoenaed
1570006371814249,1:38:41,zintle ndzwangu,Has Moyane at any point been to testify at this Zondo Commission?
1570006377995060,1:38:48,mpfariseni sydney,Why is Tom Moyane not taking the witness stand and the tell the country his version of the events?
1570006383794323,1:38:53,makhosi nobhatyi,We are not disputing the fact that Gordhan must held accountable too but Moyane not telling us truth all he is interested in is to say Rogue unit was unlawful
1570006388806086,1:38:59,Singi Mathebula,"moyana cannot continue to be an opportunist, he must tell us what he did at SARS before he can cross examine Pravin."

1570006775789150,1:45:25,Mangalani Mangalani,I conclude the following:
1570006798030343,1:45:48,Jack Sparrow,"@African Refugee no, it's not. the bar for being called a fool is far lower"
1570006808441626,1:45:58,Mangalani Mangalani,Moyane was part of state capture together with Gordhan at some stage
1570006808544684,1:45:58,Mfan'uzodlaniVEVO,so now they protecting Gordahn
1570006815750345,1:46:05,carol berry,She is implying very clearly that Moyane must testify..hes a coward

1570006885786174,1:47:16,Mangalani Mangalani,Now Moyane wants to spill beans on Gordhan and Gordhan is playing all tricks to run away
1570006918506035,1:47:48,Callistus Khathali,Gordhan must tell us why and how Moyane is involved in state capture. In fact he should have laid charges on that long time ago.
