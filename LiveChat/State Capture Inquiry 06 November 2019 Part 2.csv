1573045105091563,27:54,James Godloza Godloza,he had just implied that the commission is unfair to him
1573045105816969,27:54,mandisi ntauzana,He has a point but he is not putting it in a chronology and substantially.......... eish
1573045106284394,27:55,Phillip Cwazibe,@ Pheladi Lamola ​ It is hot.
1573045116202510,28:06,Lizwe Ndungane,He has no place to hide the rest must follow
1573045126692686,28:15,watson mutanga,"He complained about Advocate Maleka, now he has issues about the whole team."
1573045127888129,28:16,Jane .Blamire,Why did he not just send a sick note
1573045157992026,28:47,Mohapi Lafius,or kill himself
1573045163530323,28:53,makhosi nobhatyi,Let us continue

1573045226750229,29:56,Person of interest,Ask him questions. He can come back for the ones he can't remember.
1573045256675271,30:25,Eliot Chauke,"I told you, Adv Maleka was fired... because he represented EFF"
1573045276832113,30:46,Yolo More,"You see chair, you lost Maleka. I am sure you wont be a happy chair if you lose Hofmeyr too. Dont be too soft on Jimmy."

1573045323914871,31:33,James Godloza Godloza,i still say wanya manyi
1573045358768494,32:08,mandisi ntauzana,But was it necessary to subpoena Mr Manyi? did he refuse to come on request?
1573045364807362,32:14,Mohapi Lafius,o yanya o manyi
1573045393632237,32:42,Yolo More,Mandisi Ntauzana yes he refused.

1573045427638148,33:16,eliza saayman,yes their must all go and wear oranje
1573045430934198,33:20,Dominic Przybylski,@mandisi ntauzana I assume a subpoena is only issued if the witness refuses a request.
1573045432302726,33:21,Yolo More,His refusal letter was mentioned.
1573045438488404,33:27,mandisi ntauzana,The harshness of the way the commission is treating Mr Manyi smells of selective prosecution
1573045462199821,33:51,Jane .Blamire,The trolls have arrived
1573045485382627,34:14,mandisi ntauzana,But we never heard anything from anyone to suggest that Mr Manyi refused to attend except for him arguing that the matter to be dealt with is LRA matter
1573045488283859,34:17,funicanz,Ms Hofmeyer is not going to adjourn this hearing. It will go through. This time Manyi won't blame the how she's standing. She is present respectfully so let's begin.
1573045492973249,34:22,Yolo More,No chair.
1573045497382637,34:26,eliza saayman,theire stole alot of mula

1573045518919290,34:48,James Godloza Godloza,"@mandisi as his opening remarks were ""what am I doing here as I have already testified in this commission"" he thought he had fooled everyone"
1573045553434933,35:22,Yolo More,"Lex Luger, she is a slow poison."
1573045572786841,35:41,eliza saayman,look at our military veterans. its a shame what theire going thru. DISGUSTING
1573045578732284,35:48,Jane .Blamire,Wow
1573045581130173,35:50,Bernard Matolino,@Thando Nkutha @Yolo More She is something else
1573045581336830,35:50,Pheladi Lamola,Jimmy probably thought he would get Adv Mokoena and he was ready to treat him the same way he treated Maleka.
1573045583251498,35:52,Yolo More,Kate is warming up now.
1573045584309726,35:53,mandisi ntauzana,Why subpoena someone who believe that his presence should not be sought because the matter in dispute is a LRA matter........ commission should have pushed to convince him to provide affidavit
1573045594514535,36:04,Gill Oosthuizen,this lady is so sharp...
1573045600306441,36:10,James Godloza Godloza,@mandisi do you want this country to be rid of corruption?
1573045605497853,36:15,Person of interest,I love you Ms Hofmeyr

1573045628742660,36:37,Pastor J.J,@mandisi ntauzana There is no matter LRA or not that is Subjudice
1573045635486643,36:45,Dominic Przybylski,"Tholani Dlomo used excuse of being sick to explain why his employer couldn't find him for 6 months. Zuma also ""too sick"" to attend. Surely Manyi has a tame doctor to give hime a sick note."
1573045639214190,36:48,mandisi ntauzana,but let's treat each other fairly
1573045647961196,36:57,Bernard Matolino,"I salute you Adv. You were brought up well, you read well, you practise well, you put the doddgy in a corner quite well"
1573045653673748,37:02,Yolo More,Bathathe Advocate Kate! Hahahahahaha

1573048309411005,1:21:18,mandisi ntauzana,Lol yes he got a certificate in Geology Economics or something like that
1573048314276010,1:21:23,Yolo More,"He lied and said he was never charged, now that they have the evidence, he is changing the tune"

1573048864760473,1:30:33,Born free,Zondo wants to go home
1573048870861046,1:30:40,Yolo More,"Dominic, thats strange."

1573048932754680,1:31:41,Dominic Przybylski,@Sthakathi Khumalo If land was stolen it was stolen when population was about 3 million so the extra new 50 million did not have their land 'stolen'.
1573048932824898,1:31:41,Edwin Kok,who testifying now?
1573048944032565,1:31:53,mandisi ntauzana,NN2...........
1573048948162114,1:31:57,Mashao Mohale,The letter is a revelation
1573048975855622,1:32:25,Sthakathi Khumalo,Those statistics are so petty and premature. I will not dignify that with a response
1573048987705637,1:32:37,Pastor J.J,@Simon Davies . I ask respectfully and need to be enlightened. Apartheid laws changed 25 years ago but do you honestly believe that in practice that people who practised apartheid changed with the law
1573049000100823,1:32:49,Moshoeu Mabusela,@Skhakhathi I agree. My question is who is allocating land to farmers or whites. These ppl are moving up and down in our land freely. something is not right here.
1573049011825945,1:33:00,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Anywayss, back to Manyi he seems to be Manyiring himself here"
1573049069193613,1:33:58,mandisi ntauzana,NN5.......... NN2........ Mr Manyi is gonna deal with this
1573049087213496,1:34:16,Yolo More,"Academic Editors, I am sure you only came now. He has been a drama queen from the beginning.I think he is tired now. Hahaha"
1573049094802145,1:34:24,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Tholithemba Ntsele Noted, I have left them to debate it in their ignorence."
1573049110718149,1:34:39,mandisi ntauzana,Heather why? he is just ventilating his views even if you disagree with them
1573049112837433,1:34:41,Pansophical lighthouse,Yes most of them have Pastor. I refer you to the referendum that denounced the practise in 1992? They voted AGAINST apartheid
1573049145396983,1:35:14,Pastor J.J,I respect and accept that view @Simon Davies
1573049160182985,1:35:29,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Moshoeu Mabusela Its our ANC that sits with them, infact they are told what to do!! CR17 for example is being told by white capital how to run the country, Rupert instructs everything!"
1573049165803356,1:35:35,mandisi ntauzana,but opposing views will obviously be divisive
1573049186967357,1:35:56,Jane .Blamire,Says who....proo
1573049192341211,1:36:01,Jane .Blamire,proof

1573049246410193,1:36:55,Kevin Simon,Sthakathi Khumalo ​ Really?
1573049250245301,1:36:59,Yolo More,The Norwegian ambassador must come and sing.
1573049254453927,1:37:03,Sthakathi Khumalo,Debate people and dont name us things when we challenge your views!!
1573049273376473,1:37:22,Derek Main,"@mandisi ntauzana A different opinion is one thing, racism is totally another."
1573049325811618,1:38:14,Dominic Przybylski,"@Sthakathi Khumalo After 25 years of ANC rule our country is bankrupt. Let's hope our politicians get advice from people who know how to run a country successfully, doesn't matter what colour skin."
1573049327850816,1:38:17,mandisi ntauzana,Ok Derek I hear you
1573049333957087,1:38:22,Yolo More,You bribed him bloody crook
1573049339036132,1:38:28,makhosi nobhatyi,Lies in defense of himself
1573049363836348,1:38:52,Pansophical lighthouse,Stop throwing tantrums and just admit your complicity in state capture. How much are they paying you to appear so stupid this afternoon? 😉
1573049385963514,1:39:15,Moshoeu Mabusela,"Ppl are getting rich in our country, mining minerals, getting all farms, collecting all the money and investing offshore, while we are busy killing each other in poverty. SA WAKE UP!!!"
1573049386083627,1:39:15,Kay Kay,I smell bribery here
1573049387433661,1:39:16,Sthakathi Khumalo,What is racist by saying inequality is still alive and white people are still benefiting from the past. Land that is productive is still under the arms of a certain minority.. Unless I am wrong
1573049434908848,1:40:03,Yolo More,You bribed her and you failed.
1573049470575735,1:40:39,Dominic Przybylski,@Sthakathi Khumalo That is our problem. State capture and our unions have no interest in productivity.
1573049478530364,1:40:48,Dylan Jacklin,Get the ambassador to testify
1573049488685701,1:40:58,Yolo More,Hahahaha
1573049489854172,1:40:59,nhlanhla nkosi,lol this guy
1573049497489766,1:41:06,Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo Why don't you go back through the comments and see if there is any racism there?
1573049499723434,1:41:08,T Johnson,Prissy hiiii

1573049599738687,1:42:49,Sthakathi Khumalo,The problem is you entered my discussion with someone through the window and who became insultive to our views!! This is why youve missed everything
1573049611887465,1:43:00,Sthakathi Khumalo,Derek Main
1573049652784315,1:43:41,Born free,Unions are South Africa's downfall.. there are other ways to support employees and their rights.. not these unions which make alot of money from their members6
1573049687029556,1:44:16,Pansophical lighthouse,Our views??? So you've got accomplices here 😂😂😂
1573049688889087,1:44:18,Lungelo Dlaba,Norsk 🤔
1573049708279732,1:44:37,Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo I was here reading the comments - just didn't want to get involved. I don't like associating with racists at all.
1573049711465143,1:44:41,Pansophical lighthouse,Nice admission!
1573049757792011,1:45:27,Kay Kay,he's now passing buck around I don't trust his answers on this issue
1573049765233411,1:45:34,Derek Main,"@Sthakathi Khumalo While I agree there are many issues that need to be addressed, there are ways and means. Some are helpful, some aren't."
1573049789733330,1:45:59,Yolo More,Looks like the chair respects Manyi too much.
1573049817169979,1:46:26,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I didn't say he was - I just think he was defending one.
1573049821222521,1:46:30,Sthakathi Khumalo,Derek Main Fair enough bro but be consistent when some people call others names when they have nothing more to say or generally challenged
1573049852874634,1:47:02,Dominic Przybylski,We need Rassie Erasmus to come in as coach to the government. Teach them how to get our country to be a winner rather than the loser which the world is sadly watching.
1573049877840909,1:47:27,Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo I try to be consistent but I choose my battles. Sometimes it's just not worth it. Some people cannot reason.
1573049899665941,1:47:50,Yolo More,Who Thando Nkutha?
1573049971741106,1:49:00,Born free,when Africans can become independent and lead their countries into a prosperous Independent country and stop relying on European handouts.. then you have a right to Independence and prosperity.
1573049974134035,1:49:03,Sthakathi Khumalo,Haai Guys can we get back top manyis evidence
1573049985307450,1:49:14,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I can do that. I haven't blocked him - I generally like seeing his point of view.
1573050016037898,1:49:45,Brennan Fredericks,mr manyi had a conflict of interest and was called out on it
1573050022151303,1:49:51,Niek Cape Town,MANYI IS BUSY DROWNING IN HIS OWN WORDS.
1573050024064820,1:49:52,Pastor J.J,I have been with @Derek Main and many others on this chat since the start of the commission last year and I can say that Derek has never been a racist and will defend against it.
1573050071264570,1:50:40,Derek Main,@Pastor J Thanks Pastor - appreciate the support.
1573050080142062,1:50:49,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Conflict of intrest mchana, you are cornered!!"
1573050117803745,1:51:27,Yolo More,"Thando Nkutha, Sthakathi Khumalo and Derek Main are not racists. I think they misunderstand each other. The racist is Dominic Przybylik."
1573050132114126,1:51:42,Born free,I am not racist just a realist..
1573050154617605,1:52:03,Dominic Przybylski,@Yolo More Please indicate what I have said which is racist.
1573050165545935,1:52:14,Yongama Mdleleni,He won’t remember this letter

1573050197825325,1:52:46,Pansophical lighthouse,How is Dominic a racist?
1573050198324076,1:52:47,Derek Main,This is getting a bit like trying to find someone who voted for the Nats 😁
1573050212303806,1:53:02,Pastor J.J,@Thando Nkutha I did pray and continue to do so. I have also prayed for your naughteee roving eyes upon Young Kate. hahahahahaha

1573050237390556,1:53:26,Yolo More,He wont recall everything from now on.
1573050238898543,1:53:28,mandisi ntauzana,Mr Manyi is dealing with thee questions correctly and I think he will come up tops and doesn't have anything to hide.
1573050260319014,1:53:49,Sthakathi Khumalo,Norman Zwane Uvukaphi nkunzi??
1573050275761195,1:54:04,Kay Kay,So he indirectly disclose his conflict of interest and yet call the issue frilious.... Ms Hofmeyer is really sharp she caught
