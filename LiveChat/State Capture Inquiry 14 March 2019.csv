1552549322541681,9:09,Desmond Masilela,This is another way of wasting time. instate of starting 9:30 am we tend to start 10:00 just to try and fix filing. This is annoying.
1552549444414642,11:11,Frik Brits,"@Desmond Masilela , Like I said, If I was the judge here I would have sent them all back to their offices to fix this filing then come back next day."

1552549672609801,15:00,Frik Brits,"@Desmond Masilela , Would that help?, I think after one send them back Judge Zondo can always make them work overtime. That would fix everyting."
1552549721428304,15:48,Desmond Masilela,@Frik Brits. work overtime they will need more cash for that. Warning would be better.

1552554234650825,1:31:01,Neil Fraser,His argument is pointless because if he was concerned about it all he would first find out who drafted the letter before signing it.
1552554299071800,1:32:06,carnoth ngomane,"thought hes said Zwane centralised everything, but clearly this guy was not in charge of his own office"
1552554302634596,1:32:10,Chris Welensky,"For a ""Dr' this dude is talking in circles patting himself on the back!"
1552554313562810,1:32:20,Norman Zwane,@peter pott Tjo! Those are expensive pecks. I guess in theses economic times its worth suffering otherwise in order to access these perks.
1552554350681958,1:32:57,Magda Seguin,It seems that they wanted to create 'fall guy's...in essence 'patsys'
1552554413533121,1:34:00,Magda Seguin,Typical mafia modus operandi

1552554510166710,1:35:37,carnoth ngomane,i wonder what criterion was used to hire this guy as a DG
1552554523886041,1:35:51,Neil Fraser,Haha The letter just appeared in his out tray... he signs it
1552554554902130,1:36:21,Desmond Masilela,@Thando Nkutha. Exactly and that is where you get caught.
1552554556561222,1:36:23,Neil Fraser,... and just disappeared from his office.
1552554579207256,1:36:46,Magda Seguin,The day Koko testify should be explosive he has a LOT to account for
1552554627904321,1:37:35,Sfiso Nkosi,@Neil Fraser who does that in his rightful mind. This Dr must open up and tell the truth.
1552554648062712,1:37:56,Tobo Lwandile,"leave the dg alone he was just caught in gupta corruption network, he did not benefit"
1552554669424609,1:38:16,Magda Seguin,People were manipulated according to their character flaws
1552554703348229,1:38:50,Neil Fraser,@Sfiso Nkosi Or lets agree it was a error of judgement. There‚Äôs obviously some deeper sinister activities within the department.
1552554741194056,1:39:28,Magda Seguin,@Tobo exactly so many people were used and abused...it was capture strategy
1552554795799482,1:40:22,carnoth ngomane,"you dont know who brought the letterto yuor attention, yet you sign it and it suddenly disappear, What a joke"
1552554817857314,1:40:45,Magda Seguin,The psycho dynamics of state capture is thesis material

1552555031078460,1:44:18,Sfiso Nkosi,@Tsepang Ranneileng that can only happened if they have something against you.
1552555058914660,1:44:46,Desmond Masilela,NO such thing. You forgot to put the date then you caught up with something!!! how possible is that

1552555088333219,1:45:16,Magda Seguin,@Tsepang...it happened to me once and I flatly refused to sign and made myself very unpopular as the 'troublemaker' and 'too clever for
1552555097567281,1:45:24,Tsepang R,and it takes the slightest blip for you to get compromised and inevitably become the scapegoat. We are all human after all. This guy has an impeccable service record! give him a break!
1552555105514796,1:45:32,Sfiso Nkosi,@Desmond Masilela üòÇüòÇüòÇit doesn't make sense

1552555140536155,1:46:07,Magda Seguin,I saw many people being used...tragic
1552555152955526,1:46:20,Tulonga Henoch,Impossible...he remembers very everything but that wants to prove his non-involvement in this. If you were not part of the game you will spill the beans.

1552555219511472,1:47:27,Johnny Cash,We will nationalise and expropriate VBS bank so it doesn‚Äôt matter about jail or the 2IC
1552555254501153,1:48:01,Neil Fraser,He should have acknowledged his error of judgement first up. Better late than none.
1552555287778158,1:48:35,Desmond Masilela,@Thando Nkutha. He accept the wrong doing but that will let him in trouble trust me.
