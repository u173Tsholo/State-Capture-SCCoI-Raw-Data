1553768226175712,2:14:11,Sofia Sofia,"The issue of the payment has been traversed in some detail in the public domain since November 2018,"
1553768229410492,2:14:14,Sofia Sofia,"and News24 dug into the transaction around the same time, confirming key details that supported President Cyril Ramaphosa and his son's version on the payment."
1553768253258474,2:14:37,Sofia Sofia,"Edelstein Farber Grobler, the law firm that held the trust account which housed the CR17 campaign funds, confirmed the account belonged to the firm and that it was used for this purpose."

1553768268810040,2:14:54,Sofia Sofia,News24 at the time also obtained independent verification from sources in the banking sector that this account did in fact belong to the law firm.
1553768270231241,2:14:55,Cameron Kim,@Marvel Ramatshela he is with his ANC comrades drinking expensive drinks
1553768274162809,2:14:59,welton paulse,Watson is now owning the car wash where Agrizzi took his car for wash and note was stuck on window
1553768275064198,2:15:00,Myka'Al Daud,ANC cadres lease land to whites to farm n they pay them.ANC won't expropriate the land they already own n benefit from.
1553768287063532,2:15:11,Sofia Sofia,President Ramaphosa himself confirmed the purpose of the EFG2 account was to house donations to his ANC presidential campaign in 2017.
1553768293699622,2:15:18,Andrew Mboweni,what will the future of south africa be like as from 09 may 2019 after the election after so much of the state capture commission revelations
1553768299832710,2:15:24,Magda Seguin,The current PP compromise as well
1553768306090709,2:15:30,Precious Ntshangase,"Desperation make people to believe anything and , thts why they fall prey to fake pastors, fake leaders and so on, our youth believe EFF because they think they are the solution. They are wrong"
1553768306305823,2:15:31,Sofia Sofia,Here is what you need to know about the R500 000 donation to CR17:
1553768341307832,2:16:06,Sofia Sofia,"Venter states that on October 18,17,Watson instructs him to pay R3m from his own personal bank account into the account of a ""dummy company""or front company named Miotto Trading and Advisory Services."
1553768355139762,2:16:19,Sofia Sofia,"At the time Miotto's sole director was Margeret Longworth, Venter's sister."
1553768356650864,2:16:22,Magda Seguin,SA lacks leadership that is why people turn to fake pastors
1553768363753810,2:16:28,Sofia Sofia,Miotto's registered business address is Longworth's residential address in Krugersdorp.
1553768384414200,2:16:48,Stanley Lebea,Agrizzi my guy u deserve to be rewarded by huge land like nkandla✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼
1553768390135424,2:16:55,Sofia Sofia,"Venter states he was instructed to pay R500 000 from Miotto into an account named ""EFG2"" at ABSA bank."
1553768395958736,2:17:01,Andrew Mboweni,eff was formed from anc so cant believe in leaders who are full of anger and who benefited from the support of corrupt leaders as such jacob zuma who was campaigned by julius malema
1553768398855430,2:17:03,Sofia Sofia,"The remaining R2.5m was to be used for an alternate purpose (the purchase of a home for Lindie Gouws, but this transaction was not completed, Venter explains)"
1553768409772354,2:17:15,Magda Seguin,@Sofia Sofia...yes he gave his testimony yesterday...he is one dodgy individual too
1553768410963750,2:17:16,Yandi Masina,Hey @Sofia Sofia Long time!

1553768443384846,2:17:48,Given Nyathi,its a pity because many South African will still vote for the ANC after they have done such corruption.

1553768525444288,2:19:10,Sofia Sofia,"Watson himself states in the SMS it is an ""attorney's trust account"". Watson makes no mention of the Andile Ramaphosa Foundation in the SMS."
1553768538248084,2:19:23,Sofia Sofia,Venter further attaches proof of payment which shows an amount of R500 000 paid from Miotto's FNB account to the EFG2 account.
