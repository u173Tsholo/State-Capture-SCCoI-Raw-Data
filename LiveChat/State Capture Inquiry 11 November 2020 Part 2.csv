1605107428390946,2:15:06,SanFran Arnold,"@Angelo Doubel whatever floats your boat. Just because everyone says so, doesn't make it true, and is not a great argument The facts show that JZ is an idiot, they left him holding the baby."
1605107434342279,2:15:14,Miles High Club,When Jesus comes ive got some nice dagga we gonna hang n chill n smoke n chow some fruit n icecream
1605107443140991,2:15:22,Dominic Przybylski,If government can be automated then we don't need politicians who contribute nothing except conflict.
1605107443416183,2:15:22,Naledi Barron,"@Dominic Przybylski One the one hand, that's great. On the other, people - human beings - need work in this capitalistic nightmare. I refer you to Aldous Huxley and George Orwell."
1605107445555930,2:15:24,RduP,@MIKE thanks yohhh all made in China

1605107476249852,2:15:56,Easy D,@ Bradley Gother... lol...
1605107477192692,2:15:57,Angelo Doubel,@Sanfran Arnold Zuma comes across like someone who is un educated. but he is very intelligent.
1605107511438951,2:16:31,Nemabubuni Geoffrey,"Mzwlwane, HAhahahahah🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐"
1605107513906343,2:16:33,Freddie Van Rhyn,Zuma is not intelligent he is wily
1605107530511769,2:16:50,MIKE DURBAN,@Angelo Doubel ....Heheheh......especially when it comes to........money.....
1605107532244456,2:16:51,Naledi Barron,Bring me a Government of National Unity. A balance and counter-balance.
1605107552858587,2:17:12,Ntando Matata,he is uneducated and he does take advantage of that but he is not totally intelligent but in most cases he is evasive
1605107562388299,2:17:21,RduP,@MIKE DURAN so sad
1605107568738074,2:17:29,Mzalwane Mzala,"@Freddie Van Rhyn A reality is that the second and third biggest parties hate each other. They could negotiate in 2016 but not anymore. No one party can take on the ANC, now."
1605107577258764,2:17:37,Angelo Doubel,@ Sanfran Arnold how much money left country in the last 10 years? through the state capture project
1605107578645312,2:17:38,ALTA,@Bradley Gother wow thats not nice sjoe😏
1605107580116751,2:17:41,SanFran Arnold,@Angelo Doubel Grade 2 is no education. He comes across like an idiot because he is one.
1605107605883528,2:18:06,MIKE DURBAN,@Naledi Barron ....Spot on......just what we need......or something like a coalition govt etc.......
1605107614548673,2:18:11,Angelo Doubel,@ Sanfran Arnold his not

1605107643101351,2:18:42,MIKE DURBAN,Let's Make SA Great Again........
1605107662223777,2:19:02,ALTA,1 2 3 block
1605107676351689,2:19:15,Mzalwane Mzala,Our constitution does not cater for government of national unity like the one we tried in 1994.
1605107679928738,2:19:16,SanFran Arnold,"@Angelo Doubel if you want to be Zuma praise singer by all means, but I believe him to be the fool he is......28635382 8 - listen properly"
1605107681630687,2:19:18,Miles High Club,I've read the whole bible high
1605107694579005,2:19:31,Ntando Matata,"Geoffrey, we not captured by Zuma here. We are captured through him"
1605107695783919,2:19:33,Dominic Przybylski,@Naledi Barron Automation of government into an efficient incorruptible service will allow people to be more productive and generate a better standard of life . There would be more work not less.
1605107703639233,2:19:44,ALTA,bye @ Bradley Gother
1605107709753865,2:19:47,Angelo Doubel,@Sanfran Arnold 🤣🤣🤣. they are his friends

1605107762340866,2:20:40,Naledi Barron,"@Dominic Przybylski Automation of government - Birth to Death and whole life inbetween i.t.o gov't interaction - yup, I raised that concept years ago."
1605107768810987,2:20:49,ALTA,Rdup ja ne dis erg genugtig
1605107793000293,2:21:12,Mzalwane Mzala,No realistic option to form a coalition against the ANC can work without the DA ad the EFF. All other parties are too small. Fact
1605107840793992,2:21:58,Miles High Club,🌍🌎🌏
1605107843958134,2:22:01,Angelo Doubel,@Sanfran Arnold I am praising him. i hate what he has done. To corrupt half the ANC leadership
1605107856464414,2:22:15,ALTA,Rdup beslis
1605107858677013,2:22:17,Naledi Barron,"Yes @MIKE DURBAN and @Mzalwane Mzala , A coalition/GNU IS possible. It just needs the will of the people."
1605107871514113,2:22:31,Heather Durr,BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOOM
1605107889593026,2:22:50,Naledi Barron,@Heather Durr ROFLMAO!!!
1605107897006501,2:22:56,Dominic Przybylski,There is only one thing which motivates all politicians - a thirst for power over other people.
1605107938993662,2:23:39,Mzalwane Mzala,@Naledi Barron It must start with getting the DA and the EFF in the room and around the table. That would be a coalition government.
1605107948690735,2:23:46,Heather Durr,HA GUPTA GOTCHA NSEPE
1605107991120533,2:24:31,Tommygun,"@Mzalwane Mzala impossible, they at opposite ends of the Venn diagram with maybe a 1mm overlap"
1605107992985612,2:24:33,Phakamile Khuzwayo,"better coalition Government will be action sa,da; cope and ifp"
1605107993635806,2:24:33,SanFran Arnold,"@Angelo Doubel there is no intelligence in selling out your country, your own mense. If he was this intelligent then I am sure Apple would hire him - NOT"
1605108030619576,2:25:10,Mzalwane Mzala,We tried a government of national unity in 1994 where the biggest 3 parties were represented. The NP walked out after about 18 months
1605108031323410,2:25:11,Freddie Van Rhyn,then guys these smaller parties should work harder in winning over new voters. but I do not trust the EFF as kingmakers because they misuse that power for their own benefit not for the people
1605108033066289,2:25:13,Nemabubuni Geoffrey,"what SA needs is what we are now... our parliament politics is balanced... in our country, we only a balanced parliament politics so to hold the ruling party accountable"
1605108034741737,2:25:14,Angelo Doubel,@Dominic Przybylski politicians wants to control people.
1605108086537648,2:26:06,Nemabubuni Geoffrey,"SA politics is at its best now,"
1605108099527980,2:26:18,Mzalwane Mzala,@Tommygun Without that arrangement there can be no coalition government against the ANC in South Africa in the 20 years or so.
1605108109644756,2:26:28,MIKE DURBAN,@Angelo Doubel ...Too true.........Covid Lockdowns.....as an example......
1605108154918434,2:27:14,Dominic Przybylski,@Angelo Doubel Yup. That's why I don't want them in my life. The only person who should control me (as an adult) is me. The only person who should control you is you.
1605108179244516,2:27:39,MIKE DURBAN,@Angelo Doubel ...This is what it is all about......the aim is a One World Satanic Govt....true....

1605108303784639,2:29:44,Dominic Przybylski,The power mongers try to herd us into a 'collective' mindset. That's the only way they can get power over us. If we don't recognize and honor our own individuality we betray ourselves.

1605108312769154,2:29:52,Mzalwane Mzala,No one party will grow to the point of taking on the ANC on its own @Tommygun
