1571212995684030,2:13,Phillip Cwazibe,@Derrick saperstein ​ With cost of this inquiry. Same but I am hping that the state will recover more than the cost.
1571213240690037,6:18,Ben Cole,No talk shop. It casts sunlight on darkness where there was none. It prods our consciences to make better choices in future. It will in time lead to prosecutions.
1571213248680717,6:26,Murugasen Ganesh,what new
1571213266014496,6:43,Derek Main,I think this commission should run permanently to name and shame all the corrupt cadres.
1571213594067867,12:11,Zama Kubheka,There are so many people who have not come forward yet. I feel like this is dragging!!! when is state capture gonna finish?
1571213619335320,12:36,Ben Cole,"@I am free, if that London comment is true, it is a pity because we desperately need the investment. But, our President also needs to be reminded that we all, investors too, are seeking action."
1571213713078163,14:10,Derek Main,@Zama Kubheka State capture and corruption will never stop as long as the ANC is on power. They are corrupt to the core.
1571213768224136,15:06,Derek Main,I don't think Ramaphosa's strategy of telling everyone what they want to hear is fooling anyone anymore.
1571213903930638,17:21,Derek Main,@I Am Free Those were pledges and they often don't materialise.
1571213926699918,17:44,Lady Bird,You must ask how much of those investments went into Ramaphosa's pocket...
1571213934139886,17:52,Zilungile Khumalo,but a few NPOs are NGOs
1571213943394772,18:01,Zamankwali Ngema,Totally agree with you.. @ I am free
1571214007896266,19:04,Lady Bird,Derek I hope that those pledges are incumbent on action on corruption
1571214027906750,19:25,Slindile Ngcobo,@I Am Free ....you are still not free...hehehe
1571214030265709,19:27,Derek Main,"@I Am Free You may be right but I still think it's a semantics game he was playing. He said ""secured"" but that could still mean just a pledge."

1571214155863531,21:32,Mzobanzi Dazela,Remember when Alexander riots were staged only for free ANC campaign program in the cry for help. Ramaphosa hasn't done any of the promises he promised those people. Very unfair.
1571214172770155,21:49,Lady Bird,Is there not a clause in law where NO GOV OFFICIAL OR THEIR FAMILY should NOT benefit from gov. financially ? I mean come on

1571217437075777,1:16:13,Derek Main,@I Am Free The EFF's recent popularity tells me that their message resonates with many fellow SAfns and I think these issues need to be debated and addressed.

1571223420095978,2:55:56,Derek Main,@Thulani Bukani It's attitudes like yours that cause more division - you must be ANC. You do realise that you are racist - the NP would be proud of you.
1571223429091757,2:56:06,Jabu Malinga,"White ppl must just accept that apartheid was bad and that they benefited directly or indirectly does not matter, they must just admit and move on. problem is,white ppl deny deny deny"

1571223523830784,2:57:40,Tebogo Makoro,@Jabu Malinga The problem mfo is that many of them did not make the most of that opportunity!!! now they see every rich black person as a criminal or in gov...that's why they will never admit
1571223542167986,2:57:58,Frans Phala,"pointing fingers won't help any of you, till we stand as one voice politicians will forever loot your tax money. indulge in the ideology of race"
1571223546971297,2:58:03,Frans Phala,change starts with you stop wanting to change others if you are still trapped in the error of apartheid
1571223556697243,2:58:13,ThandaM,@Lady Bird Are you crazy. Why must he prove anything. Don't you have google to research for yourself. Are you really so racist that you think no black person could become rich from hard work?
1571223593234500,2:58:49,Derek Main,@Jabu Malinga I have never denied that. Are you prepared to admit that what we have now discriminates unfairly against whites?
1571223602309990,2:58:58,Tebogo Makoro,@Lady Bird Do that work yourself boo boo! im not here to satisfy your lazy racist sponsored views!

1571223636964249,2:59:33,Mzalwane Mzala,Th white people who died fighting apartheid were enemies of white supremacists so they must not conveniently try to claim them now when they hated them with passion.
1571223676770561,3:00:13,Jabu Malinga,"derek, its not an eye for an eye. you admitting apartheid was bad has nothing to do with what is happening now."
1571223685140881,3:00:21,Sindiswa Moolman,So this MEC was a Gupta appointee
