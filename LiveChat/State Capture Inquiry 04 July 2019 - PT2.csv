1562242686983233,13:57,Pastor J.J,"We abandoned Apartheid,supposedly, and embraced Democracy, supposedly, 25 years ago.The more I slap myself to believe the people of this country have embraced change the more some chts prove me wrong"
1562242736658162,14:46,Bernard Matolino,"@Pastor J It's a long journey, mfundisi. It is like an exorcism. Please pray for the lost mfundisi"
1562242800727005,15:50,Elton Bruce Thindwa,@Pastor J Bona it makes my blood boil

1562242871729054,17:01,funicanz,@Lex Luger 😆
1562242881308415,17:11,Pastor J.J,reading some of these chats more especially challenges me everydAY EMOTIONALLY AND DEEPLY SPIRITUALLY
1562242883167691,17:13,Nyasimi Geoffrey,hahahahhahahahha
1562242883739394,17:13,Dominic Przybylski,In 1994 I celebrated because I believed we would all see each other outside of the prism of race. But race now has a higher profile in our communication than any other aspect of ourselves. Sad.
1562242955892076,18:26,Thami Ngwenya,who is perpetuating race card
1562242958397041,18:29,Magda Seguin,"@Dominic,here where I am there are a multitude of nationalities from all over the world,I have only experienced respect and unity"
1562242967153635,18:36,Nyasimi Geoffrey,Indias landed a wedding plain on southafrica airbase this one they must hung
1562242971372526,18:41,Bernard Matolino,@Dominic Przybylski It is so sad. My daughter's classmates never saw each other in race terms till grade 3. Now as grade 6s they have split along racial lines and they are hardening
1562242977792875,18:47,Nyasimi Geoffrey,if i was king
1562242988138083,18:58,Pastor J.J,@Dominic Przybylski . It seems that the more we try and convince ourselves that we need to embrace each other the more i meet people on the chat that reminds of the past. very sadly so
1562243008215596,19:18,Queen K,Dominic Przyblyski the mouth speaks from the abundance of the heart..it’s who they are.
1562243050348174,20:00,Pastor J.J,@Lex Luger . I actually did but it seems that my prayers do not work anymore since i retired this year
1562243073260994,20:23,Yolo More,"Old school gentleman, yummy toppie."
1562243080747200,20:30,Thami Ngwenya,"Pastor, missing the point, the past will assist us to form concrete foundation on race."
1562243082820019,20:32,Nelson Musoliwa,Will this testimony not compromise military security of the country?
1562243110361379,21:01,Bernard Matolino,@Pastor J Some voodoos like Bafana Bafana are not deserving of prayers. You just watch the voodoo unfold as it would
1562243132619329,21:22,watson mutanga,@Nyasimi Geoffrey: Do not expect respect from an individual who doesn’t respect themselves. Zuma is such an individual.
1562243163446554,21:53,Aniceth De Missamou,@Pastor J you should fast and repent
1562243167695878,21:57,Pastor J.J,@Thami Ngwenya . Yes Thami but some of our brothers are so blatant on this forum and the rascist comments are deeply painful
1562243191519197,22:21,Anne M.,"@Nelson Musoliwa No, it's at a high level which is similar to other countries"
1562243217671070,22:47,LYD online tv,@Lex Luger who's the witness?
1562243236068293,23:05,Nyasimi Geoffrey,@watson mutanga this man Zuma must have brought so many respectable institutions into disrepute
1562243238982092,23:08,Nyasimi Geoffrey,i guess
1562243243108103,23:12,Bernard Matolino,@LYD online tv The chief of the airforce of SA
1562243255376592,23:25,Nelson Musoliwa,Thanks Anne for clarity
1562243257892264,23:27,Aniceth De Missamou,@Pastor J for your prayers to be answered.
1562243276061408,23:46,LYD online tv,@Lex Luger is he the one who let the Gupta landing?
1562243280476115,23:50,Thami Ngwenya,"Where does this race card emanate from in this group.It is when people calling name like stupid followers, pass rate 30%"
1562243296049644,24:05,Pastor J.J,@Aniceth De Missamou . Yes yes I will heed your advice
1562243299436437,24:09,Bernard Matolino,@Aniceth De Missamou The pastor has said his prayers retired with him
1562243338927068,24:48,watson mutanga,@Nyasimi Geoffrey: He started by dismantling institutions of government. These stood in the way of corrupt practices.
1562243341808870,24:51,Anne M.,@Nelson Musoliwa 👍
1562243346969158,24:56,Bernard Matolino,"@LYD online tv No, he says he found the landing improper. He was 6 months into tis position and he identified other weaknesses"
1562243363305174,25:13,Richardt Human,Chief of air force but taking no responsibility at all. Passing the bug.
1562243372274097,25:22,Bernard Matolino,@LYD online tv He was too high to handle landings
1562243404380497,25:54,Aniceth De Missamou,"@Lex Luger it's dangerous, prayers are for life. Until the last day on earth"
1562243407966319,25:57,Dominic Przybylski,"We need a culture of individual responsibility, collective responsibility does not exist."
1562243418678255,26:09,Neville Watson,Number one gave instructions period
1562243433484752,26:23,LYD online tv,@Lex Luger Interesting! 6 months as Chief sounds like a lot of time on the job.
1562243434288499,26:24,Bernard Matolino,@Aniceth De Missamou I am just teasing brother
1562243440525241,26:30,Thami Ngwenya,"Guy is lying, trying to confuse with empty presentation"
1562243440692918,26:30,Nelson Musoliwa,No best system can be safe from unscrupulous people; instructions from above confused the standard operation procedures
1562243444212866,26:33,Ewald Kruger,Yip! @Richardt Human ​bChief of air force but taking no responsibility at all. Passing the bug.
1562243453721746,26:44,LYD online tv,Chair is now deliberating...!!!
1562243464269197,26:54,Yolo More,"Nelson Musoliwa the pink ones, their old and new generation already are well informed about these things. Even the Indians. It's only us blacks who are only learning now."
1562243473118156,27:03,LYD online tv,@Thami Ngwenya I agree with you
1562243492661844,27:23,Sofia Sofia,If you tell the truth you won't need to think ! #Justsaying
1562243503440875,27:33,Gareth Morgan,whos this guy
1562243521597375,27:51,Gareth Morgan,he is making excuses
1562243543192272,28:13,watson mutanga,"@Dominic Przybylski: I agree. One of the solutions is for each adult to find themselves. Most people lack social and emotional intelligence, and on top of that we do not know that we lack in such."
1562243549801221,28:19,Yolo More,The chair sees through him. I said this guy is full of himself.
1562243576287032,28:46,Thembelani,this oke thinks he can throw wool over Zondo's eyes
1562243588921800,28:59,President Matt K,we have lost.... we facing Egypt.
1562243612089957,29:22,Legae Nyalungu,answer the question Chief..they knew the correct process but deviated from it.
1562243613293918,29:23,Ewald Kruger,Yip @Yolo More. He is a slime ball like Zuma.
1562243621770070,29:31,Abe Molefe,question says all of you no 1 saw its wrong instead he explain ai
1562243624280157,29:34,Nelson Musoliwa,More unfortunately one must not swallow more than what can chew; learn we have and very fast time is of an essence.
1562243626424501,29:36,Bernard Matolino,@matt kumalo Can't the team just call in sick on the day
1562243629025422,29:38,LYD online tv,@matt kumalo I think the players have won though...
1562243633678034,29:43,Sofia Sofia,Did he go for the wedding too ?
1562243637213145,29:46,watson mutanga,@Yolo More: that’s down to perception. One can say that the guy is confident and or passionate.
1562243642224529,29:52,Zinhle Cindi,"These checks and balances seem to be the 'scapegoat', its a matter of saying who should have done those checks and balances"
1562243656894335,30:06,LYD online tv,@matt kumalo R320k each...
1562243660513001,30:10,Bernard Matolino,"@Sofia Sofia No, he is a serious man."
1562243678129589,30:27,LYD online tv,@Sofia Sofia Yes he was one on the drivers in the Land Rover.
1562243678681358,30:28,Bernard Matolino,@LYD online tv so they can embarrass us
1562243680974066,30:30,Yolo More,"Ewald Kruger, he thinks he is smarter than the chair."
1562243711682522,31:01,Ewald Kruger,No @watson mutanga. He is trying to manipulate the attention away from himself. Slime ball.
1562243719206543,31:09,President Matt K,R320k....?????😫 now we have really really lost
1562243727251250,31:17,Legae Nyalungu,"Chief, we work on policy, process and procedure not trust and integrity"
1562243727883278,31:17,Sofia Sofia,Yes or No
1562243738000874,31:27,Daniella Morgan,You cannot work on trust and integrity. You work on policies and procedures! No matter who made the error in the line of command - you as the leader remain accountable!!
1562243739807603,31:29,Khaya Nomoyi,"As Chief of Air force, he should have known that there were flaws in the system.I hope they now have checks and balances."
1562243744962846,31:35,Ewald Kruger,"Exactly @Yolo More ​ Ewald Kruger, he thinks he is smarter than the chair."
1562243750755225,31:41,Yolo More,"Watson Mutanga, no."
1562243761918030,31:51,LYD online tv,@matt kumalo yes they got paid R320k each for getting to the ast 16. How Lucky?!
1562243765940551,31:55,Sofia Sofia,is he reading his evidence ?
1562243774045901,32:04,Andani Jarana,"As the Chief Of the air force, I said NO hahaha"
1562243797199211,32:27,Dish,"yeaahhh the okes are having a big party. laughing, joking...."
1562243801629319,32:31,LYD online tv,CHIEF is protecting someone.
1562243802762699,32:32,Thami Ngwenya,this GUY MUST BE SEROUS
1562243821542500,32:51,Nelson Musoliwa,Trust and integrity can not supersede standard operation procedures; this guy is confining himself to military oath of not giving away your commanders.
1562243823845518,32:53,Dish,doesn't seem to be much of a disciplinary to me.
1562243832238221,33:01,Richardt Human,Pathetic leader of the Air force. Suurstof dief.
1562243841598160,33:12,President Matt K,they should have kept the prize money secret.... you know us south africans
1562243847505662,33:16,Jonas Mtsweni,they don't checks and balances even now
1562243852787988,33:22,Legae Nyalungu,people we are not safe
1562243878832322,33:48,Ewald Kruger,The leader is laughing...WOW...
1562243879229152,33:48,Dominic Przybylski,"""We do not have enough people who stand for what is right."" Summarizes the whole sorry mess."
1562243902585361,34:12,Thami Ngwenya,"In China, he was finished"
1562243924239050,34:33,Neville Watson,"How can we trust this guy with our country, he have no backbone"
1562243938768391,34:48,Legae Nyalungu,"if we are attacked tomorrow, I doubt this defence force will no what to do"
1562243951248951,35:01,Aniceth De Missamou,"The reason ""Checks and balances"" are not there so they can get away with anything. For how long that institution has be established that there's no such? The Army is always well organised anywhere."
1562243965636647,35:15,Robert Russell,In China he would have been hung for treason
1562243968904995,35:18,Dominic Przybylski,Chief of defence force would be cadre-deployment without a shadow of doubt.
1562243981888819,35:32,Bernard Matolino,@Legae Nyalungu Have you forgotten how clueless they were is small Lesotho?
1562244010087064,35:59,Richardt Human,Our country is at huge risk with this guy being in charge of the air force.
1562244014700441,36:04,Yolo More,"Yes chair, no presentation. He must respond to the relevant issues. He was trying to consume our precious time for nonsensical presentation"
1562244048065626,36:37,Nelson Musoliwa,Our officialdom is vastly manned by spoiled brats as this commission revealed thus far.
1562244070585486,37:00,Mandela's child vryheid,these people domt care if your wealth leaves the county they dont care if youl be poor for generations to come along as the get a piece of the pie

1562244123391178,37:53,Sofia Sofia,All I see him do is protect someone ....
1562244127299846,37:56,Bernard Matolino,This chief is lacking appropriateness for the occasion. If he wants to crack jokes with Zondo they must make a date for that. I am dissapointed in this brother
1562244141162474,38:10,Yolo More,He has been trying to escape all the questions.
1562244144812693,38:14,Thami Ngwenya,"He needs my lawyer, he will be finished"
1562244169744806,38:40,Bernard Matolino,He needs Vincent Maleka
1562244178390614,38:48,Daniella Morgan,does matter if someone is new!!! there are policies and procedures. He is a useless leader.
1562244185116900,38:55,Dominic Przybylski,How could this man handle a real war if he was overwhelmed by a single incident in CAR and one helicopter crash?
1562244205848612,39:15,Yolo More,"Thami Ngwenya, who is your lawyer?😊😊"
1562244225067440,39:35,Nyasimi Geoffrey,THe answer is NO
1562244231645086,39:41,Nyasimi Geoffrey,i dont get involved
1562244238222424,39:48,Thami Ngwenya,"They are two, a lady and a guy"
1562244253795606,40:03,Andani Jarana,he did not get involved before but he is getting involved now LMOA

1562244372429112,42:02,Phillip Cwazibe,@Richard Andani Democlish Jarana he was new in the post and did refuse permission for entry.
1562244380014490,42:10,Yolo More,"Nyasimi Geoffrey, he is disgusting."
