1601888070440763,37:38,Mzalwane Mzala,The EFF was correct in referring to her as Dudu Myeni-Zuma. She was the real 'First Lady' and the 'Prime Minister'
1601888071937805,37:40,Phakamile Khuzwayo,if apartheid government was more corrupt but not to their own ppl like what is anc doing to us
1601888083708995,37:52,rohan barnard,anyone defending the anc is a beneficiary of corruption
1601888092559791,38:00,joyce tendai Zvavareyi,if found complicit why would he not be prosecuted as others
1601888095806868,38:05,Elvis Malakoane,Mthokozisi Molefe Only court can determine whether he is going to jail or not opinion is irrelevant at this stage
1601888097471997,38:06,bruinman,@Gerard Victor Please leave my uncle out of this. He was never part of state capture rather land grabs which makes him a member of the EFF in 1952

1601893766356189,2:12:34,SD Gudunkomo,I think chairman will come to a conclusion that Zuma had a meeting with Dudu before the meeting
1601893773288771,2:12:42,Andre Heydenrych,this guy is a bulls.... ter.
1601893780845483,2:12:49,Christopher Peters,"Ther was evidnce, where Zuma asked ""what are we discussing today"""
1601893783950616,2:12:53,Sthakathi Khumalo,Mama D - jovial strategists!!
1601893786748691,2:12:57,Derek Main,"Even if Zuma stays out of jail, I'd be happy to see him squirming in court for the rest of his days."
1601893802560164,2:13:12,Mzalwane Mzala,Jabu was an Eskom insider or an intelligence person.
1601893808897854,2:13:17,Mike Segale,💯
1601893812116118,2:13:22,SanFran Arnold,@Derek Main I want to see that too
1601893830566208,2:13:39,SD Gudunkomo,Derek Main. why?
1601893831478155,2:13:40,Elvis Malakoane,He says DUDU was jovial with President How else would they be given Talent was born
1601893833894472,2:13:42,Eddie Reddy,"Mugabe chased Linell from zim., now he joined Dudu to steal our money"
1601893856154269,2:14:05,Derek Main,@Sabelo Nxumalo Because he deserves it for what he's done to SA.
1601893864133079,2:14:13,Xolile Titus,so who's this Jabu who might have suffered from 'cultural subservience' 🤔
1601893873715080,2:14:23,Mike Segale,👮‍♂
1601893905833521,2:14:55,SD Gudunkomo,Derek what did he do that wasn't done before or that is not happening now?
1601893918982911,2:15:07,Eddie Reddy,"Elvis once she tasted the fugu once, she was always happy"
1601893952246853,2:15:41,Phindile Mbonani,@Xolile Titus I think is Jabu Mabuza former chairman of the Eskom board
1601893956978592,2:15:45,Derek Main,@Sabelo Nxumalo Have you not been listening to what they are saying here? Or are you just not paying attention?
1601894014455385,2:16:44,SanFran Arnold,YES ADV. SALEKA
1601894041354381,2:17:10,FieliesSA,for R2M p.a. I would not ask that question
1601894055026348,2:17:24,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Derek Main We can't call ourself christian if we do not forgive. Let's start by forgiving Zuma
1601894058450983,2:17:28,SanFran Arnold,"No Mr. Linnell, she is SAA and ESKOM has its own board."
1601894066351816,2:17:35,Xolile Titus,@Phindile Mbonani I doubt. Jabu not young and also had experience interacting with Presidents from his previous role as Telkom chair.
1601894075922063,2:17:44,SD Gudunkomo,But Derek you sound like you hate him not because of corruption but perhaps for something else

1601894104616430,2:18:13,Derek Main,@Mbuso Ndlovu I don't call myself Christian because I am not Christian. I don't forgive Zuma.
1601894128385566,2:18:37,SanFran Arnold,"@Sthakathi Khumalo yes she was, I believe that Talente was their baby....but thats just me"

1601894135273892,2:18:45,Derek Main,@Sabelo Nxumalo Name a reason to hate Zuma and I'll agree with you.
1601894140734437,2:18:50,Mzalwane Mzala,@Phindile Mbonani Jabu Mabuza was not in Eskom when Zuma was president.
1601894142992345,2:18:51,Elvis Malakoane,"Talk son, spill the danm beans you will forgiven not really forgiven, aag! just speak man!"
1601894157413757,2:19:06,Kena,"@Mbuso Ndlovu, I will never forgive Zuma. I can’t wear my ANC regalia with pride today because of what Zuma has reduced the ANC to including his cabal. I despise everything about him"

1601894215055760,2:20:03,Mpho Seatlholo,"nie manh, we forgive them but still need to pay back the money and be jailed"
1601894217216442,2:20:06,Gerard Victor,@ Mbuso Ndlovu Please also praise Eugene Terreblanche as with him there would be no Zuma
