1552032523188779,34:13,carnoth ngomane,This commission presents golden opportunity to CR to uproot corruption and restore the already tarnished image of the ANC
1552032758732438,38:08,Bridgette Kekana,no free education but free flow money Anc is corrupt to the core
1552032804716094,38:55,P V,this guy just knows money. and he is sooo calm
1552032851605442,39:42,welton paulse,this guy seems to be more factual

1552033397573305,48:47,Derek Main,@Yin Yang Transnet is too much of a mess - that will cause load-shedding for sure

1552033970430628,58:20,Robert Russell,CR says he will only act on a report from the commission on cabinet members...the commission needs to wrap up ESKOM and issue a report.... otherwise nothing will happen as the it will go on for ever
1552034189414945,1:02:01,Bridgette Kekana,CR must just act now bfore commission ends
1552034210719969,1:02:20,roberto wilco,Soon as the government get hold of the reserve bank it will be game over 100 rand to the us/dollar

1552034401338666,1:05:31,Robert Russell,this commission will be busy for years and years if they don't issue reports ASAAP and not at the end
1552034404038865,1:05:35,roberto wilco,Literally gonna run out of money and then they will have to print more money zimbabwe/venezuala style
1552034424771777,1:05:55,welton paulse,problem is that ANC wont go after parliamentarians only after people outside government look at Agrizzi
1552034441250508,1:06:11,roberto wilco,Exactly
1552034473275696,1:06:43,Robert Russell,agreed Welton
1552034492033455,1:07:01,Bridgette Kekana,yes we are no longer fooools
1552034492108165,1:07:01,Derek Main,@Robert Russell Don't forget about the cell companies - their capture of the state also needs investigating
1552034493449688,1:07:03,Raymond Mabilo,@Russell I agree with you....im sure now they can see the problem they must issue the report ASAP
1552034518943542,1:07:29,Bridgette Kekana,even a blind man can see
1552034565977236,1:08:15,welton paulse,i would say arrest parliamentarians first and send a stern warning to the rest and the world.
1552034611612348,1:09:02,roberto wilco,"It is scary ,best to get money offshore if you can or just leave"
1552034646326050,1:09:37,Derek Main,Seems like nothing has changed in the ANC - still protecting the corrupt criminals in their ranks. They deserve to be punished at the polls
1552034649384432,1:09:40,welton paulse,@ying yang very much so
1552034652007217,1:09:42,Robert Russell,Yip.... who wants to take a chance of naming all the implicated ministers... ??????
