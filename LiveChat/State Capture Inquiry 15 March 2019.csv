1552640621446805,1:20:04,Thulani Bukani,Trucker sits in one of ANC war rooms. These guys are getting paid by ANC to protect corruption and skew narratives.
1552640634759851,1:20:17,StarManRSA,@Musa Bakiti anybody can be racist. being black does not make you immune. You cannot paint an entire race with one brush. In South Africa we are all individuals. Peace and love.

1552640670517347,1:20:52,Serepa Le Mabona,The plot to use this platform to tarnish ANC and not individuals involved with the hope of gaining votes will be defeated.
1552640672143267,1:20:54,Isaac Patsa,So why is Mr Jonas answering questions from the Guptas who have refused to appear
1552640686671295,1:21:09,StarManRSA,"Guys, just simply block Trucker. It's easy and you will feel much less anger afterwards."
