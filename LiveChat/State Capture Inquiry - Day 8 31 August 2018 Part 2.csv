1535721668777079,58:24,iAmBlackHouston,@Steemit OneAzania I already know what's going on. The names are minor details. The fact of the matter is that what is going on in South Africa isn't unique.
1535721670222990,58:26,hub.grasstruths,@iAmBlackHouston i suggest you refrain from using such racist references here
1535721684151871,58:39,iAmBlackHouston,@Steemit OneAzania Black people can't be racist

1535721794637689,1:00:30,j b,this appears more of one business doesnt like another business from coming in and competing or taking over. both sides engage in corruption. that's what I'm getting from his Soviet Union reference.
1535721795899219,1:00:31,Ewald Kruger,This chat has been colonised by Professor Doctor from iAmBlackHouston. Any one has some Brooklax to flush the Prof from Texas out?

1535721988757079,1:03:44,K,@iAmBlackHouston oh that makes sense
1535721993763739,1:03:49,iAmBlackHouston,"@Keryn If a chinese plum tree is planted in canada, it's still a chinese plum tree"
1535722019448064,1:04:12,hub.grasstruths,@Althea Oehlschlägel i can tell you the term was used in the late 90's already
1535722022149745,1:04:17,Fils de l'homme,they coined it after studying it across many states including the USA
1535722040150773,1:04:35,makhosi nobhatyi,"No these guys explain how the state capture occurred, they are not buttering anyone"
1535722049164854,1:04:44,Peet Venter,"Click on Fils' name and then click ""block"". Problem solved."
1535722053564481,1:04:48,Nkosikhona Ginya,malema is the ANC greatest mistake.. they are paying for everything they did to him.
1535722055085611,1:04:50,Orefile Macheoane,This is actually very informative.
1535722071914474,1:05:06,hub.grasstruths,among comrades who would joke.. the term was previously - to suggest counter revolutionary tendencies. but the ANC lost it's 'revolutionary' rheteroric
1535722098438863,1:05:33,hub.grasstruths,"then the term became 'that comrade is cpatured' it meant his brain was so weak, he was chasing gravy instead of servingb the people"
1535722100767279,1:05:36,clint moodley,I second that
1535722137801140,1:06:13,clint moodley,ask SARS to investigate Duh you admire as f**king idiot

1535722202395372,1:07:15,hub.grasstruths,"@Madluphuthu by sister, when did you go begging for helpo LOL"
1535722216211553,1:07:31,Orefile Macheoane,All private entities wish to twist the hand of the public sector.
1535722252549421,1:08:08,K,Don’t go preach about socialism if you wear the most symbolic product of capitalism
1535722267179479,1:08:21,Madluphuthu,@I Am Freedmen because the first world countries steal from us and they have been doing so for many years.
1535722274858001,1:08:28,Black Panther Amen Kuma,Rich have noting to do with land but people
1535722287802584,1:08:43,Nkosikhona Ginya,whites have nothing to do with the bible..
1535722296146855,1:08:51,R Botha,a lot of people in here are just complaining cos they don't understand or are not listening. or are to focused on skin color
1535722297837050,1:08:53,hub.grasstruths,this witness is making a lot of sense. butthe problem is the checks dont work because the people in parliamentare all thieves too
1535722328962291,1:09:23,Black Panther Amen Kuma,@Madluphuthu gave europeans there own people for richeness materials am i right??? Rich Folks
1535722338395039,1:09:33,hub.grasstruths,a lotof people can't understand the testimony or google for that matter ;-)
1535722339038020,1:09:34,iAmBlackHouston,white people bough the bible to South Africa.
1535722347295464,1:09:42,Orefile Macheoane,"This ,actually, is big for the case."
1535722354377673,1:09:49,hub.grasstruths,eish thista\ racist is like a mosquito
1535722381894066,1:10:15,K,All the politicians act like they are fighting for the poor but the truth is that they all greedy and only care about their pockets. Stay woke
1535722387625241,1:10:22,hub.grasstruths,@Orefile Macheoane absolutely it is placingthis in a global context and perhaps we can find a way to secure the state better
1535722396500098,1:10:31,Martin Havinga,iAmBlackHouston and I Am Freedmen.......which one of you is the real one and which one is the sock puppet ?
1535722397985387,1:10:33,Black Panther Amen Kuma,THERE ARE LAUGHING AT YOU ALL
1535722426540516,1:11:01,Orefile Macheoane,This will be a foundation for the judgements. Expert advice will give the Chairperson guidance and an approach.
1535722426651873,1:11:02,Millicent Shozi,hope our world can be as serious like now on the land issue
1535722436838383,1:11:12,Madluphuthu,@Thando Nkutha point is Africa is too diverse with different visions and goals. I just don't see how our visions could be aligned at this point.
1535722442797230,1:11:17,Lowkey Apparel,BORING!!!
1535722458710329,1:11:33,hub.grasstruths,the witnesses prior to this were just talkingabouttheir observations and whatthey were offered and didnt do. They never pointed a finger at any person where that person could be charged
1535722464961923,1:11:40,Black Panther Amen Kuma,@Martin Havinga I MUST HAVE HIT A NERVE IF I HIT A NERVE ITS THE TRUTH YOU DONT ACCEPT STUPID
1535722486874245,1:12:01,j b,isn't it like when they said apartheid is legal when they engaged in such societal structure practices. they had made it into law after they captured SA.
1535722491840033,1:12:06,Sindiswa Moolman,"Some of us like to know what the State Capture actually is, and not rely on Jacob Zuma's defnition @Thando Nkutha"
1535722503340197,1:12:18,Orefile Macheoane,We have never had a case of State capture before. This will set a precedence.
1535722510518649,1:12:25,iAmBlackHouston,@jeneva batten Thank you. That's exactly what they're saying.
1535722514112046,1:12:29,Martin Havinga,Sockpuppets don't have nerves.....
1535722529571169,1:12:45,hub.grasstruths,"@Orefile Macheoane this is true I agree withyou. The public is here hoping to find outwho did what.. so far, that hasn't suirfaced. BUtthe terms of referenec of this inquiry I think dont go as far"
1535722562598004,1:13:17,R Botha,that's called ignorance. they are making great points and making a great case to make all those thugs that's been stealing from all of SA pay they are giving us a great foundation to fight back.
1535722573508359,1:13:28,Orefile Macheoane,otherwise this has been a case of the blind leading the blind. Asking who did what and where is all circumstance. Very true @Steemit OneAzania
1535722610560839,1:14:06,iAmBlackHouston,"@I Am Freedmen That guy, @Martin Havinga is a white guy, he lives in Cape Town, Western Cape , go check out his Facebook and you might even know where he lives, specifically"
1535722613814934,1:14:09,hub.grasstruths,I have no confidence in this process. Actually. No one will be jailed
1535722644226563,1:14:38,Black Panther Amen Kuma,I KNEW IT BRA
1535722644399825,1:14:39,iAmBlackHouston,"I already downloaded his pictures of his family so if you don't get it in time, let me know, I'll send it to you. @I Am Freedmen"
1535722651096112,1:14:46,EMILY PHENYA,Legal corruption due to extra illegal activities shaping the laws.😨😨😨
1535722656463754,1:14:51,hub.grasstruths,and Ithink these suggestions the judge will make based on this impportanttestimony will not be implemented. we heard this in the steinhof case today too
1535722671569658,1:15:06,Black Panther Amen Kuma,@iAmBlackHouston BET
1535722683906386,1:15:17,hub.grasstruths,there is no political will to change anything because it works - it is paracite-friendly
1535722689814053,1:15:24,Orefile Macheoane,"Before Penny Sparrow, Vicky Momberg, we had never had to prosecute anyone based on a social media misdemeanors. we needed to set a benchmark, this is where we are."
1535722743578516,1:16:18,EMILY PHENYA,"So much has been exposed, jailing ppl should happen."
1535722752750253,1:16:27,R Botha,it would have killed us all
1535722773198389,1:16:48,Black Panther Amen Kuma,@White African THEY SHOULD
1535722787395346,1:17:02,Orefile Macheoane,you cant even prosecute a human being for a labour matter. even if they put you through a lie detector.
1535722788266951,1:17:03,hub.grasstruths,@EMILY PHENYA yes i dont see the pointto have all these inquiries. we dont need this - we have courts of law
1535722799581176,1:17:14,hub.grasstruths,this is an expensive side show
1535722808505148,1:17:23,Black Panther Amen Kuma,we know what yall about aint no fooling african americans

1535722864722009,1:18:20,hub.grasstruths,@Orefile Macheoane these guys stole state money - there has to be a way to prosecute them
1535722866339634,1:18:22,EMILY PHENYA,Very expensive process for the country and not even sure if suggestions would be implemented
1535722868043374,1:18:23,Nkosikhona Ginya,they can leave the other ones but ajay must fall
1535722872319801,1:18:26,R Botha,it would blow SA back to the stone ages
1535722877496082,1:18:33,Lesetsa Maenetja,"u must stop being impatient guys. 4rm my point of view, this is legit to these shambles guptas caused to our country. its gd 2 seek this kind of clarity and assessments on state capture."
1535722881565209,1:18:36,Black Panther Amen Kuma,who you think made nuclear weapon?? Huh??
1535722883306958,1:18:38,Orefile Macheoane,We cant even prove that money was stolen. All we know is that conversations of influence were had
1535722884707776,1:18:39,Lesetsa Maenetja,We still gonna hear more shocking news from these inquiry.
1535722921337187,1:19:16,hub.grasstruths,@lesetsa maenetja guptas didn't do anything worse than any other thief. the biggest thieves are the politicians.
1535722931542538,1:19:27,hub.grasstruths,we should round them up and jail them for life
1535722933225721,1:19:28,iAmBlackHouston,"@Martin Havinga I see you like going to Caledon Hotel & Casino , and you even said ""Zuma is not my President"" . Do you see what I mean @I Am Freedmen , They are 100% evil, all of them."
1535722936128733,1:19:31,R Botha,we also had nuclear bombs
1535722938743780,1:19:33,EMILY PHENYA,Finally the whole parliament would be implicated
1535722956384051,1:19:51,R Botha,we are the only ones in the world that gave them up
1535722960932928,1:19:55,hub.grasstruths,@EMILY PHENYA for sure!
1535722967596492,1:20:02,Orefile Macheoane,"People were offered minister jobs, to make favorable decisions to Gupta owned entities, that is hard to prove. We can build a strong circumstancial case based on people like Williams"
1535722970860562,1:20:06,R Botha,they are not worth the loss of life
1535722977032876,1:20:12,Black Panther Amen Kuma,BULLSHIT were not in a recession
1535722987803417,1:20:23,Black Panther Amen Kuma,were in the surplus
1535722990848503,1:20:26,Kojo Parris,Fascinating!

1535723007845300,1:20:43,iAmBlackHouston,"@White African So, what do you think about Malema? Do you support him and the EFF?"
1535723010644543,1:20:45,Orefile Macheoane,"i stand to be corrected, but a Brazilian prime minister was jailed for the very process of state capture."
1535723018037362,1:20:51,Sindiswa Moolman,Yes @Kojo Parris. Im glued to this.
1535723032338697,1:21:07,iAmBlackHouston,"@Orefile Macheoane Was the Prime Minister , Black or white?"
1535723045754059,1:21:21,iAmBlackHouston,"@Orefile Macheoane Brazilian is not a race, it's only a nationality"
1535723050775811,1:21:26,hub.grasstruths,@Orefile Macheoane I dont believe it can be so hard to prosecute. There is just a protection of these guys
1535723051400901,1:21:26,Kojo Parris,"The Guptas are certainly guilty of grand corruption, but not SC. Unlike a lot of large companies in SA!"
1535723067715002,1:21:43,iAmBlackHouston,"@Steemit OneAzania Exactly, a lot of protection."
1535723072818041,1:21:47,hub.grasstruths,we had witnesses so far who can be cross examined to reveal a lot more
1535723102827906,1:22:17,hub.grasstruths,but they are being softly questioned. its a collusion to protec their bosses. they are all captured even now
1535723105131697,1:22:20,Orefile Macheoane,you cant tell me skin only comes in two colours. i would start to think you are also captured @iAmBlackHouston
1535723126217243,1:22:40,iAmBlackHouston,"@Orefile Macheoane In the system of white supremacy, you're either Black or white."
1535723131691825,1:22:46,Black Panther Amen Kuma,specially white americans
1535723148012048,1:23:03,Orefile Macheoane,"@Steemit OneAzania If it was that easy, Nkandla would have been an easy case to prosecute Zuma"
1535723152749202,1:23:07,hub.grasstruths,@Orefile Macheoane i am too toired to argue with such racist minded people again 😉
1535723154360513,1:23:09,Black Panther Amen Kuma,these people need to be locked up
1535723158274014,1:23:13,Vukile Racaza,You guys are still talking about race?Wow
1535723164050232,1:23:18,Kojo Parris,This evidence is undermining the political objectives of the Commission
1535723165611256,1:23:20,Black Panther Amen Kuma,and there lying under oath
1535723220325487,1:24:15,iAmBlackHouston,Don't believe him.
1535723220943370,1:24:16,Orefile Macheoane,@iAmBlackHouston i honestly believe you refuse to renew your mind. I fear for your children.
1535723221124649,1:24:16,Black Panther Amen Kuma,THERE YOU GO .... under the law made by whitesw
1535723247253408,1:24:42,hub.grasstruths,@Kojo Parris it will just be ignored if it goes against the political objective i.e. a cover up
1535723249000714,1:24:44,Kojo Parris,The revolving doors phenomenon and the gross influencing of legisation has been esp staple in post-94 SA………the remit of the Commission need to be expanded!
1535723251539433,1:24:46,iAmBlackHouston,@Orefile Macheoane I feel sorry for South African Blacks if most people feel like you down there.

1535725052875116,1:54:48,Blak N Eazzy,Black people never wanted to dominate anyone
1535725064660873,1:55:00,hub.grasstruths,the most intense and ignorantracists in south african politics today claim to be black conscious - Biko must be turning in his grave in Ginsburg
1535725066802796,1:55:02,Black Panther Amen Kuma,but we need to
1535725068495313,1:55:04,Floyd Bafana,@Madluphutu the things they are posing outside the country they are making us look Bad as individuals Yesterday i watched some DOCUMENTARIES they say they wanna move out of SA

1535725190293238,1:57:05,Nduduzo Zondi,Wars in the post-independent Africa as a result of divide & rule scheme of the wets

1535725246933492,1:58:02,Blak N Eazzy,Tribalism is a disease
1535725265026627,1:58:20,iAmBlackHouston,@Thiza William Are you white or Black? I love Marcus Garvey.
1535725267854254,1:58:23,Blak N Eazzy,@Thiza William you are the disaster for even thinking that
1535725271252956,1:58:26,hub.grasstruths,@Thiza William the term is still necessary but only in a situation where peopel are honest abouttheir inferiorotyy and stop clinging to race as defined by apartheid
