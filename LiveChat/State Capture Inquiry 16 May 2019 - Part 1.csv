1557994593297976,43:21,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Thando Nkutha it is true what you are saying all departments are busy cleaning up systems and correct procedures to be followed
1557994796941872,46:44,Nelson Musoliwa,Thando if we were a rational and functioning state state looters should have been isolated from a society taking into account billions of rands lost in SA
1557995189509401,53:17,Born free,Ramaphosa was warned by the World Bank to clean up corruption or no more handouts.
1557995321295918,55:28,Born free,That is the reason Eskom has taken a loan of R70 billion from China because the World Bank does not support corruption.
1557995729145325,1:02:17,makhosi nobhatyi,President Ramaphosa is tightening up loose screws and allow prosecution flow in a fast way coz no reason not to finish with investigation and prosecution of those who did wrong
1557995903073388,1:05:11,makhosi nobhatyi,Ace Magashule said commission findings are not binding telling himself publicly which he lied to himself once the report comes out NPA and tribunal get in to charge those finds doing wrong
1557995983762534,1:06:31,Kenneth Kenneth,batohi she is going to do nothing about this situation course she is there to protect there corruption of anc comrades
1557996076738590,1:08:05,William Pieters,how much money did Nedbank make out of all these deals as well?
1557996100333003,1:08:28,OctoMK,"kenneth,kenneth,is batohi not indipendent anymore?"

1557996195726647,1:10:03,OctoMK,the gvmnt needs to build MORE PRISONS for these culprits including MAGASHULE and his club
1557996255363121,1:11:02,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Luvuyo Zantsi I am appealing to all South Africans to support Ramaphosa, branches of the ANC defend movement not to be used by those whom wants to serve their interests to fight back"
1557996331130107,1:12:19,OctoMK,"makhosi,I fully agree with you 100%"
1557996395524575,1:13:23,Robert Russell,@Mk maga gaming ...government does not need to build more prisons..... they just need to put bars on Loot Freely House... all the big crooks are there.
1557996410631064,1:13:39,Sebation Nantsika,Let not forget fikile mbalula is also fighting for the ANC and the President
1557996437620014,1:14:05,Felix Muyoba,that is how crooks operate..they do the dirty tricks first and then try to legitimise the act later..
1557996565018260,1:16:13,Granny Mokwena,"the ANC acts as a collective, one of the reasons there will never be a political will to deal with corruption head on!"
1557996577112107,1:16:25,OctoMK,"You know, this state capture has left me with so many un answered questions as to :WHEN IS MONEY ENOUGH."
1557996591346410,1:16:39,Granny Mokwena,any way we can wait another 25 years neðŸ˜“
1557996598406224,1:16:46,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Funani Manzi Mbalula is not fighting ANC and President what he was doing, he was expressing his views and analyzing outcomes that this election was most difficult if was not Ramaphosa we wonâ€™t make"
1557996663876662,1:17:52,Granny Mokwena,what boggles the mind is when it comes to building mere proper toilets for school children there's no money! it's unforgivable!!
1557996701881807,1:18:30,Xhanti Silvester,why is the wolves coach testifying
1557996760055228,1:19:27,Francois Cape Town,"Cyril sat and watched corruption happening and didn't do anything (for years) Now ANC voters are leaving, he gets involved..."
1557996763026123,1:19:30,makhosi nobhatyi,To be honest speaking Ramaphosa was most popular than the party going to elections coz our party leaders were too much painted with allegations of corruption though they donâ€™t accept that
1557996770243519,1:19:37,Maanda Manyatshe,Banks and law firms not smelling of roses in this inquiry..
1557996784292970,1:19:52,Granny Mokwena,no it's not Luvuyo! not when the ANCWL comes out guns blazing in support of her!
1557996785464452,1:19:53,OctoMK,"But if thruth be told,MORE PEOPLE VOTED FOR RAMAPHOSA,then by default the ANC benefitted..that is because we want him to CLEAN THE DIRTY ANC."
1557996816588918,1:20:25,Sebation Nantsika,@makhosi Sori my bad he is protecting the ANC
1557996853312512,1:21:01,Granny Mokwena,truth is we will never see a single high ranking corrupt politician in long jail stint in our lifetime.
1557996907799354,1:21:55,Granny Mokwena,I thought something was done when Shabir was sent to jail too ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
1557996927781359,1:22:15,Pheladi Lamola,I don't understand how Judge Zondo's glasses work. When he reads he takes them off??
1557996958337749,1:22:46,Granny Mokwena,please do maybe I can see things differently.
1557996973055629,1:23:01,Felix Muyoba,@Pheladi Lamola ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ please!
1557996993134160,1:23:21,Derek Main,@Luvuyo Zantsi I can give you many more names of cadres who are corrupt and nothing has happened to them.
1557997015458736,1:23:43,Granny Mokwena,"I only know of Block, Selebi and Shabir ( not so much)"
1557997045439110,1:24:14,Nelson Musoliwa,State capture in SA is just like economic terrorism and i wonder why no actions are taken by law enforcement agencies or is it still captured as well as Booyzen alluded to
1557997051486572,1:24:19,makhosi nobhatyi,"President Ramaphosa in his head knows exactly what people want, we give ANC not a blank chenque should not do what people want they will loose election. He is busy fixing the party and government"
1557997105317954,1:25:13,Pheladi Lamola,@Felix Muyoba I can't see a thing without my glasses. Especially when reading ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. So I need help in understanding the DCJ.
1557997123640181,1:25:32,Felix Muyoba,@makhosi nobhatyi then for next five years citizens should not expect anything on service delivery since the president will just be busy fixing the parrty..
1557997158347215,1:26:06,Granny Mokwena,ok Luvuyo that's 3 names. go on please...
1557997166549711,1:26:14,Pheladi Lamola,Ok. Understood
1557997242446273,1:27:31,Granny Mokwena,no Luvuyo Shabir is not in jail !
1557997286044019,1:28:14,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Felix Muyoba service delivery is a part of duties, as we move forward, if you heard President during campaign and after elections that he doesnâ€™t want any excuse service must go to people"
1557997352871921,1:29:21,Pheladi Lamola,Makes sense. Thanks Thando.
1557997379368048,1:29:47,Granny Mokwena,I counted him at no 2 Luvuyo.
1557997464114287,1:31:11,Born free,Zuma and his Comrades of corruption have alot to answer for.. and if Zuma refuses to testify at COI then he will answer in a court of law where he will face justice.
1557997480097206,1:31:27,Granny Mokwena,"not really @ Thando Nkutha he was given medical parole, apparently he had 3 years to liveðŸ¤” that was 10 years ago if not mistaken.. that's how corruption us taken seriously"
1557997534640060,1:32:23,makhosi nobhatyi,"I think am with President if there is no more looting and corruption there will not be protesting, he said those people are not mad actually in their rights to demand their services right"
1557997559443115,1:32:48,Sukoma Holding,"Tsotsis have been voted back in,it makes no sense now for the State capture to continue"
1557997593472927,1:33:21,Born free,We Demand we demand we demand.. just don't destroy please!
1557997627117109,1:33:55,Lew464,"Val Speirs , Zuma will plead ignorance...and how do you argue that point?"
1557997691537531,1:34:59,Granny Mokwena,if you aware then why are you saying he did his time? where? let's be honest with ourselves with what is going on here
1557997737793379,1:35:46,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha It's still the same ANC - corrupt to the core at all levels of government.
1557997738111625,1:35:46,Born free,yes he certainly presented himself as the dumbest President ever.. but he will pay one way or another.
1557997765249013,1:36:13,Granny Mokwena,"like I said, the ANC is a collective. Zuma didn't do all this alone"
1557997782126038,1:36:31,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Val speirs exactly they think are clever wants to be followed procedures that is what president is doing, he started at Sars, NPA, Eskom,SIU to get rid of corrupt individuals put people to clean up,"
1557997942711002,1:39:10,Derek Main,@Luvuyo Zantsi OK - let me correct that then - VERY FEW corrupt ANC cadres are charged for their crimes.
1557997991847492,1:39:59,Born free,"yes@granny. Zuma had the help of Julius Malema ""I will kill for Zuma to be President "", said Julius."
1557998035053443,1:40:43,Granny Mokwena,"ofcourse they do Thando, my beef it's the grounds which he in particular was given this parole! how can they claim someone is terminally ill and he goes to live 25 years?"
1557998042367921,1:40:50,Derek Main,"@Thando Nkutha No - that's not what I wanted to say. I contend that at all levels of government, there are the same corrupt ANC cadres in positions of power. Corruption will continue for a long time."
1557998106516719,1:41:55,Derek Main,"@makhosi nobhatyi Aaah - so when it suits the ANC, they are a collective but when it doesn't suit them, then it's corrupt individuals. More double-speak from the ANC."
1557998204307591,1:43:32,Derek Main,@Luvuyo Zantsi Not at all. The DA like the ANC use the collective responsibility argument to escape accountability.
1557998242105506,1:44:10,Danie Nilsen,"this is so ugly taking into account that we sit with a massive unemployment, and we had the capacity to build our own locomotives but then the kick backs will not ocurd i am ashamed for our country"
1557998312736747,1:45:21,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha What is the difference between ANC and ANC cadres? I'm not saying only the ANC are corrupt - but they are more corrupt than most.
1557998332249270,1:45:40,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main remember ANC sends no one to do corruption so we cannot defend corrupt leaders, so train was out of its rail we are pulling back to the tracks"
1557998364324494,1:46:12,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi The ANC has become a patronage network of corruption.
1557998384719167,1:46:32,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Semantics
1557998385422688,1:46:33,Yvonne Morudu,what makes me angry is that people like Nomvula are still on the list
1557998410544069,1:46:58,Granny Mokwena,sometimes I wonder where we would be if the very effective Scorpions were still here. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
1557998426309887,1:47:14,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha The ANC does not exist without people.
1557998501536254,1:48:30,Derek Main,"@Luvuyo Zantsi I think the DA are just as corrupt. If they were in power, they'd match the ANC for corruption - they just don't have their hands on the levers of power to be able to do that."
1557998532185034,1:49:00,Granny Mokwena,I didn't hear about it Luvuyo. I would blame the whole DA if they protected her and do nothing about it !
1557998536742026,1:49:04,Derek Main,@Luvuyo Zantsi So exlain to me what the ANC is without the ANC cadres.
1557998546500143,1:49:15,Danie Nilsen,it is not the DA that is sittting here it is the same party people of the ruling party i just if anybody can calculate the whole amount that went into zuma and companys or cronys pokets
1557998567524564,1:49:35,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main if you listened to us here we are not defending anyone who did wrong, we are agreed on all of those whom did mistakes must face consequences of their action,"
1557998606480772,1:50:14,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Yes - I hear that. My propblem is that you seem to be in denial at the extent of the corruption.
1557998779456999,1:53:07,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Derek main I understand your frustration what I am saying is that we are taking ANC out of Derek main pocket by doing that you would Identify problem not a party but individuals behavior
1557998824762621,1:53:52,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha You should take off your rose-tinted Ramaphoria glasses. We have been hoping for a better government for decades now. The same tired old promises are rolled out every election.
1557998900079311,1:55:08,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi You're still missing my point. There are so many corrupt ANC cadres that it's difficult to distinguish them from the ANC brand. It's a cop-out.
1557998919550207,1:55:27,Derek Main,@Luvuyo Zantsi Are you giving up?
1557998982352123,1:56:31,Danie Nilsen,it is now beev reported that SARS have colected a very big amount under the alocated target set against the national growth and this has very dark consoqeunces for our country a shortfal of billions
1557999042338666,1:57:30,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I know what the solution is - get the ANC out of power.
1557999164184864,1:59:32,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I have no option but to accept it. I will still say what I have to say. If you don't agree give me your view and we can debate it.
1557999209842461,2:00:17,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I did my bit - I definitely didn't vote for them.
1557999307843695,2:01:55,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Do you seriously think the only issue of concern is who Cyril elects in his cabinet?
1557999325811468,2:02:13,Danie Nilsen,Witch the country can not have aforded in a sense this means dark days ahead (eskom) and bad growth means more unemployment acumalating into more crime and south africa are heading for the end
1557999375057311,2:03:03,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Like I said - I have to accept that but I won't shut up.
1557999567962993,2:06:16,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha That's just the cabinet - they can only do so much. What about the corrupt at municipal level? What about the corruption at SOEs? What about the corruption in the NPA? It's endemic.
1557999605201791,2:06:52,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main I was reminded that I must be aware that I only represent one vote the ANC would lose. The ANC won without my vote. I know they will be worse this term but I have no escape. Maybe 2024?
1557999622047406,2:07:10,Derek Main,"@Thando Nkutha If I see something I don't agree with, I'm going to say so. I'm not a sheep."
1557999666107175,2:07:54,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane Yes - same here. I just thought my fellow SAfns would have more sense.
1557999721560752,2:08:49,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha You're not trying to suggest that the cabinet is involved in appointments all the way through government are you?
1557999728287402,2:08:55,Sofia Sofia,All these enquiries are a waste of time !
1557999734002438,2:09:01,Sofia Sofia,Nothing will come of it !
1557999751369656,2:09:20,Sofia Sofia,The same thieves are still going to be sitting in parliament !
1557999775449328,2:09:43,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main I think the stand against the ANC is just so desperately fractured. I have no idea how it can be brought together. Wish I knew how coz the ANC are still going to waste a further 5 yrs
1557999781033901,2:09:49,Mark Trollope,"@Thando Nkutha - there you've just hit the nail on the head. It's a top down problem. When corruption happens at local or provincial level, it's not tackled immediately from those appointed higher up"
1557999872464314,2:11:20,Mark Trollope,"It results in a mistrust. I didn't vote ANC because they've had their chance. They've blown it HORRIBLY, if we don't vote for people based on their track record, then what do we vote for?"
1557999878210820,2:11:26,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha My opinion comes from a place of wanting clean government.
1557999918397829,2:12:06,Fuad Abrahams,"we offer 100% job placement in our youth development, Training and placement after completion in the maritime sector, no is listening"
1557999956303849,2:12:44,makhosi nobhatyi,"We should accept that anc is cleansing itself, they are doing something to correct the mistakes as you heard President Ramaphosa said never never again shall we fall in a trap of state capture"
1557999994425397,2:13:22,Fuad Abrahams,after completing our workshop training for all south africans 18 to 25
1557999994902140,2:13:23,Derek Main,"@Norman Zwane Exactly - we'll be asking the same questions in 5 yrs time (and getting the same empty promises). I also wish for a new ""breath of fresh air"" party."
1558000005141438,2:13:33,Derek Main,I know there are enough like-minded SAfns who want the same.
1558000024342287,2:13:52,Mark Trollope,"@makhosi nobhatyi - the only HOPE I have left, is to believe that! I trully hope he means it too, and is not paying lip service."
1558000053653570,2:14:22,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha You seem to forget that this bunch of miscreants have been in government for the last 25 years.
1558000208369161,2:16:56,Norman Zwane,@makhosi nobhatyi Since the elections - Zandile Gumede is sheltered going to public court; EC gov swindle R12m off the back of the Gift of the Givers; Cyril re-appointed Zuma's premiers. Cleansing?
1558000216116341,2:17:04,Derek Main,*fools
1558000242991956,2:17:31,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha That's a lame excuse and you know it.
1558000316769625,2:18:44,Mark Trollope,@Thando Nkutha - oh my word. And up until now I was reading your posts and presuming an intelligent individual. Then you chose to bring up that drivel. Pity
1558000320972548,2:18:49,Granny Mokwena,truth is they chose the ANC Luvuyo.
1558000325840923,2:18:54,Danie Nilsen,i am so sad that there is no salution as C R has not the political know how he is listening to the crooks in the seo and parlement as a anc token to be president there is little he can do
1558000336966368,2:19:04,Derek Main,"@Thando Nkutha If you're happy to wait 300 odd years for things to improve, you're a far more patient man than I am."
1558000340579904,2:19:08,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main We are failed by the opposition lack of leadership and vision. The vision to unseat the ANC is proving to be too narrow to succeed.
1558000368755464,2:19:36,Granny Mokwena,people chose to stick with the devil they know
1558000380305503,2:19:49,PETER STAFFEN,Thando Nkutha after 25 years the ANC cannot live without apartheid or racism as they useless in what they do
1558000398224558,2:20:05,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Norman Zwane Who is Zuma premiers appointees?
1558000412352044,2:20:20,Danie Nilsen,Why do we not just sell out to china and get over the loss of the freedom you have neen fighting for so long
1558000491606253,2:21:39,Norman Zwane,@Luvuyo Zantsi @makhosi nobhatyi They are premiers who Zuma appointed. We are fast learning that Zuma only saught to appoint proxies which is why these are regarded as Zuma's premiers.

1558000518321948,2:22:06,Christian Boonzaaier,@Thando Nkutha The ANC is cancerous to SA right now and by demanding that they should step down is not bringing up the past...IT is something that needs to be done now for SA to continue as a Republic
1558000559157552,2:22:47,Derek Main,"@Norman Zwane I agree - if only we could have selfless civil servants and not rock stars in government, we'd be much better off."
1558000602502384,2:23:30,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha And yet you refuse to acknowledge that many of our problems today lie at the feet of the ANC.
1558000616118470,2:23:43,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Those premiers are not Zuma, Sihle Zikalala is the one who supported Zuma, Mabuyane is Ramaphosa support"
1558000681917351,2:24:49,Christian Boonzaaier,I really doubt the ANC really got a majority to be honest...Just look at Durban and PMB right now...is that how people act who just voted for the same corrupt party?
1558000689226319,2:24:57,Derek Main,@Luvuyo Zantsi It's a bit like finding people who will admit to supporting apartheid - you can't. Same with Zuma supporters.
1558000733021278,2:25:40,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Do your damndest mate.
1558000788751010,2:26:37,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha What's your point?
1558000789378256,2:26:38,Christian Boonzaaier,just like the truth is ignored by the masses @Luvuyo Zantsi
1558000818918819,2:27:07,Born free,So millions from the public purse is spent on Ramaphosa Inauguration but R100 million less than that spent 5years ago when Bossasa was involved. Ramaphosa should just be sworn we have a crisis in SA.
1558000828028300,2:27:16,Thami Ngwenya,"Derek you lost election, still mourning"
1558000857285660,2:27:45,Derek Main,@Thami Ngwenya I didn't lose the election - South Africa did.
1558000868475106,2:27:56,Carnoth Ngomane,"@Derek Main you failed to unseat the ANC, on the 8th of may, so stop complaining,"
1558000888434479,2:28:16,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I've already told you my solution.
1558000913652702,2:28:41,Norman Zwane,@Luvuyo Zantsi Honestly??
1558000914150182,2:28:42,Derek Main,@Luvuyo Zantsi That's what people say when they can't argue on the merits.
1558000914369075,2:28:42,Born free,Viva The Masses must excersise birth control because it is not the masses that pay tax but a minority of the public.
1558000963944116,2:29:31,Thami Ngwenya,"10M have spoken, your solution is not working"
1558000972203108,2:29:40,Derek Main,@Carnoth Ngomane Wishful thinking. I'll continue to say it like I see it.
1558000984476215,2:29:53,Born free,Viva The Masses are looters and cause mass destruction.
1558001009313322,2:30:17,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Keep trying to convince others to vote them out in future.
1558001032170350,2:30:40,Derek Main,@Thami Ngwenya It will eventually.
1558001087455516,2:31:35,Born free,Viva The Masses Demand and Demand but where is their contribution to the public purse??
1558001097464149,2:31:45,Carnoth Ngomane,@Derek Main just try and get more support maybe just maybe next time you will realize your dream since you failed this round
1558001142312762,2:32:30,Christian Boonzaaier,every single person who voted for the ANC approves state capture and supports corruption
1558001151697001,2:32:39,Derek Main,@Carnoth Ngomane Yes - I accept that and I will keep trying. The fools who voted ANC will soon realise the error of their ways.
1558001160487014,2:32:48,Thami Ngwenya,Not until 48 years
1558001165898438,2:32:54,Norman Zwane,"â€‹@Carnoth Ngomane I do not think, loss at the polls relegates one to a spectator. I lost, but my taxes finance this and I will complain if I so choose. ANC are government NO"

1558001430685136,2:37:18,Norman Zwane,@Luvuyo Zantsi You want me to educate you through literature that the appointment of Premiers in the Zuma years was heavily influenced by Zuma to make those elected his proxies?
1558001519641926,2:38:47,Carnoth Ngomane,@Norman Zwane you are right but it also doenst give you a platform to rebuke to who doesnt share your sentiments
1558001533120758,2:39:01,Derek Main,"@Thami Ngwenya I always find that a ridiculous argument - so because it happened in the past, we shouldn't do anything to correct what is happening now. That's just stupid."
1558001607575347,2:40:15,Thami Ngwenya,"No, at least here there is transparency, we have not had how the state was bankrupt by NP till todate"
1558001686412428,2:41:34,Derek Main,I'm all for exploring that and punishing the guilty but that doesn't mean we should ignore what's happening currently.
1558001754928218,2:42:43,Thami Ngwenya,What about the past if you are really concerned?
1558001773337653,2:43:02,Granny Mokwena,anyone who tries to justify corruption which should just be called theft just sounds ridiculously stupid.
1558001823281462,2:43:51,Lorna Kavanagh,WOW THIS IS HUGE !!
1558001837303147,2:44:05,Granny Mokwena,point is kids are falling in pit toilets after 25 bloody years Maan!!
1558001860139598,2:44:27,Thami Ngwenya,"No one who justify corruption, at least something is done to do away with corruption."

1558001934367146,2:45:42,Christian Boonzaaier,nothing is being done to do away with corruption...if that was true the ANC wouldn't be in power today
1558001995010084,2:46:43,Norman Zwane,"@Carnoth Ngomane Free speech allows me to exploit every and any platform to raise the alarm and spread my views. It does not however allow me to slander, but I repeat what is in the public domain."

1558002880459885,3:01:28,Norman Zwane,@Thami Ngwenya Winning an election is not a sign of an ability to govern. It is just that. Winning an opportunity to govern.
1558002881666078,3:01:29,Granny Mokwena,as for our generation they've stole our futures and sold us dreams of a better life.
1558002950862672,3:02:38,Thami Ngwenya,We choose a party because of its capabiliy including governing. My future is not stolen
1558003092209906,3:05:00,Thami Ngwenya,"1983, 1996 we had high unemployment and we suvived, was one of the graduates now employed"
1558003237677912,3:07:25,Norman Zwane,@Thami Ngwenya There is prosperity the other side of survival. People want to prosper not survive. The poor economic leadership by the ANC is what has led us into a dead end economically.

1558003394772547,3:10:02,Thami Ngwenya,Prosperity requires hard work endurance and focus.It is not an automatic button. Our people will succeed be patient. Talking like the world has come to an end
1558003647180844,3:14:15,Derek Main,@Thami Ngwenya Not under the ANC it won't. Only the elite few connected individuals will get massively rich.
1558003687041166,3:14:55,Norman Zwane,@Thami Ngwenya Your lecture on hard work is wasted on me. I do not share your optimism. That patience is poorly reflected in the daily protests we see. Seems the people are not that patient afterall.
1558003728274506,3:15:36,Granny Mokwena,telling people to be patient is testing them really. how many graduates are out there unemployed?
1558003759289752,3:16:07,Thami Ngwenya,"Why they voted 10m , they dont share your sentiment. Relax"
1558003773728206,3:16:22,Norman Zwane,@Granny Mokwena It is selfish.
1558003798576601,3:16:46,Derek Main,@Thami Ngwenya Because they once again fell for the empty promises.
1558003836106569,3:17:24,Thami Ngwenya,"Dont speak for them, they are sharp"
1558003957038780,3:19:24,Norman Zwane,@Thami Ngwenya You seem to have missed the earlier point that the opposition let themselves down by not offering a common destiny. The ANC is helped by the own goals the opposition scores.
1558004046872259,3:20:55,Derek Main,@Thami Ngwenya That is the only explanation I can think of. Otherwise why would they vote for a party that is so heavily implicated in corruption?
1558004279440865,3:24:48,Carnoth Ngomane,@Derek Main i think voter demographics played a huge role in our elections
1558004330234671,3:25:38,Derek Main,@Carnoth Ngomane Please explain
1558004565549514,3:29:33,Carnoth Ngomane,"@Derek Main which age group was mostly registered to vote, whats their sex and are they economically active? such things played a role"
1558004654044092,3:31:02,Derek Main,@Carnoth Ngomane I would agree with that. Many people have become disillusioned with our political system and didn't vote at all or spoilt their vote. Mostly young people.
