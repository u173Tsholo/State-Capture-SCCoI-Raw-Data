1582712365802539,2:16:48,Rob Nel,"@Lady Bird so to the north, Zim, taught them zero?"
1582712385578605,2:17:07,Lady Bird,Rob Nel clearly NOT !
1582712420945793,2:17:42,Mzalwane Mzala,He would have said it does not give @Lady Bird the right to tell black people how to respond to that situation. He is clear on that.
1582712443313020,2:18:03,Dominic Przybylski,ANC/SACP/COSATU have modelled themselves on the political elite in Soviet Union who used communism to enrich themselves at the expense of their gullible citizens.

1582712728921685,2:22:50,Dominic Przybylski,Race has been manipulate by the apartheid government and the current government to prevent people debating the real problems of our country.

1582713472089727,2:35:14,Gareth Hellyar,The word racism is too widely and too often used today. It has lost all meaning.
1582713484194999,2:35:25,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Keith Din Who is this corruptionist testifying here
1582713486693587,2:35:27,Derek Main,EFF wears a uniform because they are quasi-fascist. Similar to the Brown Shirts.
1582713513131056,2:35:55,Keith Din,Hahaha... you mean haters ran out of data faster than those who're here to have a rational talk ? @Pastor J
1582713513374839,2:35:55,Mzalwane Mzala,Why was the EFF evicted in the Eastern Cape? No speculation please.
1582713536486794,2:36:17,Pastor J.J,@yes. thats true Keith.
1582713541128146,2:36:23,Derek Main,@Gareth Hellyar That might be because racism is widespread.

1582713676834697,2:38:38,Gareth Hellyar,@Derek Main . It also may be that people are too easily offended.

1582713806165196,2:40:47,Dominic Przybylski,Race is used to obscure the real problems of our country. As long as it is the basis of political power we won't be able to solve our country's problems.
1582713820548115,2:41:02,Derek Main,"@Gareth Hellyar I don't think so. If I have any racism in me, I'd like it to be cut out with a scalpel. How about you?"

1582714027596037,2:44:29,Gareth Hellyar,Yip @Tshepo Mokoto . Trying to paint herself white.
1582714027991606,2:44:29,Derek Main,@Gareth Hellyar To deny that racism exists is to live in denial.
1582714036468760,2:44:37,hariko 4,"so, she blames Multichoise for every-thing that went wrong.... meanwhile her own Board decided to adopt Multichoises proposal...."

1582714074898796,2:45:15,lufuno nema,why she didn't said something that time ..
1582714089740496,2:45:31,Mzalwane Mzala,People who do not follow South African news must not pretend as if some of these things were not raised previously.
1582714101454646,2:45:43,Mbombo Maleka,"she was not really a leader there outside the command of hlaudi motsoeneng who was acting in the capacity of board, deo and coo"
1582714109301203,2:45:51,Pastor J.J,Multichoice is implicated heavily in wrongdoing. The CEO was and still is the Son inLaw of Gwede Mantashe. The same Gwede implicated in the Bosassa scandal
1582714114892965,2:45:56,Gerda 7,"Keith,there is nothing to understand....they are all opportunistic!'!!!"
1582714130125920,2:46:12,Bev Daniels,That was when Hlaudi was in charge

1582714146698920,2:46:28,Lady Bird,Say it is'nt so Pastor J
1582714178880935,2:47:00,Pastor J.J,It is so@Lady Bird ...Sorreee I cant say otherwise Darling
1582714227460205,2:47:48,Ayanda Diliza,Racism is an inherent feature of SA. I am more comfortable with a person who acknowledges the inherited racist behaviour learnt from childhood & are trying to alter own beliefs than those in denial.
1582714229931574,2:47:52,Jane .Blamire,@lufuno nema....she did and they pushed her out
1582714242215884,2:48:02,Mzalwane Mzala,Google search her resignation in 2014. An article appeared in Mail and Guardian on 3 Feb 2014

1582714329969333,2:49:31,Dominic Przybylski,"We desperately need to escape our obsession with race. The associated emotions prevent us from looking at things constructively, identifying the real problems and finding effective solutions."
1582714333279602,2:49:34,Derek Main,@Paul Buchel I agree it has a lot to do with respect and treating people with some dignity.
1582714340561779,2:49:42,Mzalwane Mzala,"'Two centres of power have emerged at the public broadcaster, one in the CEO's office and the other in the office of acting group chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng'. M&G 2014"
1582714372261243,2:50:14,Pastor J.J,@Mzalwane Mzala 101% correct
1582714382439505,2:50:25,Gareth Hellyar,Please lets all just stick with what is going on here.
1582714400922303,2:50:41,Mzalwane Mzala,Reports have suggested Mokhobo has had her authority undermined on a number of occasions. It is understood that she has simply had enough of the political fault lines tearing at the organisation. M&G

1582714587761028,2:53:49,Pheladi Lamola,"Ideally, we shouldn't have heard from Hlaudi before yesterday and today's testimony. He must come back"
1582714617857494,2:54:18,Mbombo Maleka,@Pastor J she was also complicit-i dont see her as having the mantle to be a leader-Why did she not protest back then?
1582714628912618,2:54:30,Gareth Hellyar,I find Hlaudi very entertaining. Would love for him to come back.
1582714650971782,2:54:52,Derek Main,@Gareth Hellyar Careful what you wish for - you might get it.
1582714673235209,2:55:14,bonke masizana,Remove Hlaudi

1582714704622766,2:55:46,Pastor J.J,@Mbombo Maleka ...She actually did and it was widely reported. Read the chats by Mzalwana
1582714723821804,2:56:05,Mzalwane Mzala,@Mbombo Maleka She raised these issues and finally left because the board was on Hlaudi's side. It was in the media in 2014 already that she left because of that.
1582714760249610,2:56:41,Derek Main,@Gareth Hellyar I thought you meant back to SABC but I guess you meant to commission.
1582714785561195,2:57:06,Lady Bird,"Pastor J the fact that she could be pushed out is concerning ,That would mean she had no recourse to redress concerns . That would also mean wistleblowers have nowhere to go"
1582714799291187,2:57:20,Mbombo Maleka,She did not raise this at parliament-i serve the PCC and she appeared many times-instead she would remain mute in the presence of Hlaudi and chrony ministers
1582714801690730,2:57:22,Gareth Hellyar,"Yes, to commission."
1582714817078004,2:57:38,Pastor J.J,Thats why she went to the Media. She was helpless@Lady Bird
1582714828115307,2:57:49,Khaya Sigundu,that coo need to be taken to acountability...where is he nowü§î
1582714828582255,2:57:49,Mbombo Maleka,she was questioned deeply during the inquiry also and even broke down a coul=ple of times

1582714891179389,2:58:52,Mzalwane Mzala,Highest level of the country were involved
1582714893613220,2:58:55,Lady Bird,That is the issue Pastor J . She should not have to go to the media . There should be structures inside . If that is absent thee is abig problem
1582714925002287,2:59:25,Mbombo Maleka,infact she was privy to some of the questionable decisions so i dont buy her crocodile tear-am certain they are in waiting as we speak
1582714930188695,2:59:31,Lady Bird,pardon my bad spelling Pastor J
