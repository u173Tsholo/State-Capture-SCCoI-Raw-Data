1537171573143907,5:17,OneStop Medical,Standard Bank
1537171587867645,5:32,MrMoyoT,"Not to bust anyone's bubble, this commission is a farce and a waste of tax payer's money. So far there hasnt been any concrete evidence of the so called state capture"
1537171634063785,6:18,Siyabonga Nxumalo,Waste of time
1537171638763973,6:23,makofane tshepho,I trust that banks will give solid evidence...
1537171672996852,6:57,Edward Buta,"@noko No one, today's business major banks of the country to give report as to why they blocked gupta account"
1537171701716377,7:26,makofane tshepho,a thing is that you are not looking at fact but evidence that tie ZUMA.
1537171713374828,7:37,MrMoyoT,How? They will just show some bank statements nje. Im telling you it wont go anywhere. No one will be arrested or charged. Its a just a show to garner votes for 2019 elections
1537171721704561,7:46,sibu zwane,remember it part of white monopoly it have too say more wrong things
1537171788378996,8:52,MrMoyoT,Its a network of transactions that will implicate the banks themselves. There are vested interests to protect the real perpetrators of state capture which is white monopoly capital
1537171823500120,9:27,makofane tshepho,ZWANE@ DOES IT MATTER WHO GIVE THE EVIDENCE OR THE FACTS IN THE EVIDENCE.
1537171833732856,9:38,sibu zwane,@mr moyo I agree no one will face jail
1537171846520974,9:51,MrMoyoT,Guptas are just small fish whom they want to throw under the bus. Which will not happen. This is just Generations or Uzalo with a well written script. They are all actors
1537171860304932,10:04,Jonathan Palivili,Mr Moyo T... kindly explain what is white monopoly capital
1537171872072895,10:15,Robert Russell,5 Minutes into the broadcast and the race card starts.... so sad...
1537171877881954,10:22,MrMoyoT,Jonathan you know very well what that is.
1537171894635450,10:38,Monique Jones,@Jonathan Palivili WMC is whatever Bell Pottinger told them it was.
1537171902924040,10:47,Jonathan Palivili,"I dont know.., that is why i am asking you"
1537171905888094,10:50,sibu zwane,@makofane it does matter .wait til Duduzani come
1537171913849695,10:58,Siyabonga Nxumalo,South Africa has always been about race. Don't come here and act DUMB.
1537171967180792,11:51,Monique Jones,@Siyabonga Nxumalo now the whole world is about race. From Europe to America to SA to S. America
1537172056614291,13:21,sibu zwane,@Jones race will always matter till the world ends if it will
1537172067959612,13:32,MrMoyoT,People dont yet realize that Guptas are being all used to cover up the real mess behind the rot in govt.
1537172069369270,13:34,MrMoyoT,All the big white owned firms have done much worse than what this fake commission is trying to fool us into believing
1537172079215657,13:43,Jonathan Palivili,Its all about race NOW ??/... so im bit confused as to how white monopoly capital affected the closing up the Gupta related accounts
1537172101771912,14:06,MrMoyoT,jonathan look at the bigger picture
1537172124263541,14:28,MrMoyoT,Closing of accounts is just a front or a ruse
1537172152181718,14:56,Jonathan Palivili,Yes thats what you need to explain .. you are answering in riddles ?
1537172171975193,15:16,sibu zwane,@Jonathan white monopoly owns banks
1537172239615433,16:24,Jonathan Palivili,"even if that is so , were not the accounts closed because of suspicion of illegal activities and money laundering by the Guptas"
1537172257952625,16:42,Robert Russell,The Banks are public listed companies... go and invest your black money in them and then you can own them
1537172295777141,17:19,William Pieters,Did you guys know that the majority of the global wealth is owned buy 5 families.
1537172317426578,17:42,Jonathan Palivili,"Please note Mr Moyo that the banks have not closed any other companies accounts , but only the Guptas accounts because of red flags raised"
1537172328560049,17:52,Nelson Musoliwa,Systematized racism is half indoctrination and it is difficult to undo indoctrination. Economic endeavors knows no race.
1537172344454715,18:08,MrMoyoT,jonathan why just focus on guptas and not other white companies as well
1537172346921190,18:11,sibu zwane,if this inquiry can quantify the money got by India family and white monopoly through state capture you real see paradigm shift from hating this India to white monopoly
1537172453278252,19:57,Jonathan Palivili,MR Moyo its because of NO OTHER companies robbing our SOEs and our hard earned tax moneys and did not know how to account for the stolen money
1537172460382615,20:05,MrMoyoT,look how they play victim and point fingers to zuma and his indian cronies. the commision is just a farce until it addresses the real state capture
1537172471707811,20:15,Robert Russell,@MrMoyoT ....and I'm afraid to say you are very doff
1537172478863738,20:23,MrMoyoT,Jonathan you act naive
1537172480540009,20:25,Sanele B.,@MrMoyoT That's true Sir.
1537172486882320,20:31,MrMoyoT,Robert how so
1537172511288337,20:55,MrMoyoT,You think this kangaroo commission will achieve anything
1537172562781452,21:47,MrMoyoT,More of our money down the drain
1537172569390951,21:53,Jonathan Palivili,Mr Moyo
1537172655229281,23:19,Monique Jones,@MrMoyoT What is state capture? Who is captured? Who is corrupt? What do we do with the corrupt? How do we ensure jobs for everyone and free education for all youth? Who's in charge?
1537172657525850,23:21,Jonathan Palivili,Mr Moyo.. you call me naive... All im asking you can you explain which white monoplly capital is involved with money laundering with our banks...

1537173212559199,32:36,Robert Russell,"@Monique Jones ...,.back under his rock"
1537173217631257,32:41,MrMoyoT,"the country‚Äôs only black-owned bank, VBS Mutual Bank, was recently put into curatorship and the big five banks ‚Äî Absa, Standard Bank, FNB), Capitec Nedbank ‚Äî have a combined 90% market share."
1537173247147895,33:11,Monique Jones,@MrMoyoT Why was VBS placed under curatorship?
1537173250954553,33:15,MrMoyoT,these are white owned and controled
1537173276680627,33:41,MrMoyoT,the financial sector contributes 22.2% to gross domestic productand controls assets worth about R4.8-trillion. meaning that R4.4trillion of that money is in white hands
1537173286538035,33:50,Monique Jones,@MrMoyoT why and who placed it under curatorship?
1537173332487304,34:36,Monique Jones,@MrMoyoT you are answering your own questions and not the previous ones I asked above.
1537173436722571,36:21,Kgothatso K,"VBS brought itself down, it didn't follow legislation and their balance sheet was in shambles."
1537173460382479,36:44,MrMoyoT,"Of the R1-trillion in cash hoarded by corporates at white-owned banks, none of that cash is black-owned."
1537173462117786,36:46,MrMoyoT,"Of the R5.8-trillion private property (excludes agrarian and commercial land) value in South Africa, blacks own township or RDP style properties."
1537173464025865,36:48,Monique Jones,@MrMoyoT 1. What is state capture? 2. Who is captured? 3. How were they captured? 4. Who is corrupt? 5. Who is in charge? 6. Who should be punished? 7. 8. 9. and 10 to follow
1537173467364431,36:51,Robert Russell,VBS was looted from the inside
1537173477648876,37:02,peter pott,"üòÄinteresting Nigeria found out that std bank, along with mtn are responsible for illicit outflow of funds in that countryüòï"
1537173500559661,37:25,MrMoyoT,im answering your question with evidence
1537173505008397,37:29,Nomthetho Nokwakha,"the problem is mind set,its not like painting a person in boardroom to be black,80 %of black people think like white people depending where you stand"
1537173509444813,37:33,Lorna Kavanagh,just as well Standard Fnb Absa and Nedbank are in responsible hands or else they wouldd
1537173528617065,37:51,Lorna Kavanagh,be looted ....
1537173553341683,38:17,Monique Jones,No @MrMoyoT you are not answering my question! Give me 1 or 2 word answers like @Thando Nkutha wants
1537173692157629,40:36,Monique Jones,I'm going to ask these questions in the sincerest way. @MrMoyoT are any black people in govt/private sector corrupt? Have they made millions from the state?
1537173696135035,40:40,peter pott,üòÄüòÄüòÄso the banks are law unto themselves

1537173782082467,42:06,peter pott,"nkutha, pay attention to what the judge is saying now"
1537173820554051,42:44,Monique Jones,@MrMoyoT if I see any person in government living high off the hog while any black South African lives in squatter settlements and hungry then I have a BIG problem with corruption.
1537173833158385,42:57,abel brown,so all the banks did the same things so they was definetly something dodgy
1537173846661017,43:10,cecil thurston vanreenen,I agree

1537173886047028,43:50,cecil thurston vanreenen,how can you close a account without asking the client to explain
1537173889094765,43:53,Nelson Musoliwa,Bank legal team line of operation is of legal nature so evidence before the team directs whether to consult the affected client or not
