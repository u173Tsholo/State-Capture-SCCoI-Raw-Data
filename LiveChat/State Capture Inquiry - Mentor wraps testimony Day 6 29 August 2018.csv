1535530661380891,16:22,PETER STAFFEN,Jackson Mpala because we see the truth and not lies that your people tell under oath
1535530663806293,16:24,Jean-Pierre Le Roux,I see all these hearings and enquiries but no prosecutions. It's just a massive waste of time and money and to fool the ppl to think we dont like corruption

1535530713887581,17:14,Jackson Mpala,She thought it was going to end o facebook. On facebook she is a sensation and big celebrate amongest the boers because the goal is to weaken the ANC and strengthen the DA
1535530726555940,17:27,J Ganasan,Le Roux - the ANC is the African National Corruption party led by Cyril who made millions from government contracts
1535530744703931,17:45,david jacobs,Stealing is stealing

1535530791241083,18:32,thando cezula,Phof Zuma is too much of a coward he'll never risk cross examination!
1535530794221076,18:35,Jackson Mpala,The boers gave her large sums of money to lie about the state
1535530816233860,18:57,TSHIAMO SEIPELO,Our Country is about to be removed on some People 's hand. is interesting.

1535530881505210,20:02,Lindarose Mazibuko,they belong in jail
1535530907848398,20:28,J Ganasan,thando - looks like she eats a trucklaod of curry every day
1535530924025566,20:44,Jackson Mpala,DA dometsic workers and gardeners are braiwashed to defend their masters
1535530924246029,20:45,Marvel Ramatshela,"To my perspective, the lady is not really a liar. She just struggles with reconstruction of the actual events in both vocally and in wrirting - Maybe due to her being poor intellectually."
1535530938556193,20:59,Thabo Kganyago,"@jean, true that but with rigid presecution, that has a concrete proof."
1535530942345793,21:03,Millicent Shozi,if these people can just call malema to sort out this whole thing will take him only one day
1535530966819429,21:27,Mteteleli Jobela,Marvel I fully agree with you
1535530984497081,21:45,Thabo Kganyago,"@Millicent Shozi ,,amandla!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1535531008834164,22:09,J Ganasan,Mandela's legacy - a party and government that is corrupt thru n thru. He must be turning over in his grave
1535531009692243,22:10,Jean-Pierre Le Roux,@Thabo Kganyago I think at least 52million ppl in SA think that most Zumas and Mandela's son must be in jail
1535531011647557,22:12,Mkhuseli Freddie,to me this state capture will expose the whole ANC. it is clear that zuma was captured and mentor and company are using that to fight their own battles.
1535531014556140,22:15,Jackson Mpala,This makes me questio the intelligece of Madonsela
1535531054932287,22:55,Mlungisi Mbanjwa,"@ganasan, what is it with this body shaming? This this reflect a lot about you than the person you are shaming."
1535531055185455,22:55,Jean-Pierre Le Roux,"eyesight??????why must she read, it looks like shes reading what to say, she is told what to say"
1535531070797579,23:11,Sofia Sofia,Do they not fear their lives ?
1535531071111557,23:11,Millicent Shozi,who wouldnt be nervouse on this spot?

1535531085925045,23:26,PETER STAFFEN,"Jackson Mpala you have no intelligence , we no intelligence of madonsella"
1535531093012082,23:33,Sofia Sofia,So even if she is lying she is BRAVE!
1535531100982214,23:41,J Ganasan,"fat people are a blight on society. Lazy body, lazy mind"
1535531104470911,23:45,Jackson Mpala,Now she claim eye sight but she is ever chatting on facebook
1535531113339991,23:53,peter pott,"Mpala! our challenge in the country is that we allow many to get away with a lot of things, as long as the course they pursue is to get out someone prominent"
1535531121096071,24:01,Millicent Shozi,@le roux you racist
1535531131814545,24:12,Thabo Kganyago,"@Jackson Mpala , the poor madonsela was fired because they knew she knows a lot about then, remember when JG ZUMA was accused of breaking his own aoth of office."
1535531161775453,24:42,Paul molane,madonsela was never fired
1535531166749067,24:47,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,Fakey is back. day 3
1535531171294011,24:52,Mteteleli Jobela,"I understand why she's nervous, this is not a child's play..."

1535531229125574,25:50,Philisiwe Khumalo,i dont understand why would people protect corrupt people just because they belong to their race

1535531277038331,26:37,Marvel Ramatshela,@Ganasan - May I kindly suggest that you withdraw your view about full bodied people. I don't think it's Ayoba my guy.
1535531277107637,26:37,Nduduzo Zondi,Zuma also had to manipulate NPA by appointing someone who will delay prosecutions of top officials..Shaun Abrams..that's why he had to address the parliament over pending prosecutions of top officials
1535531332256228,27:32,Millicent Shozi,you stole our land yes rot in jail
1535531338173881,27:38,Jean-Pierre Le Roux,why are there no white ppl implicated in this state capture? or are there?

1535531696838863,33:37,Mteteleli Jobela,"Sipho, may she think it might be faked...."
1535531774305845,34:55,The Truth,"@Thando, true, credibility will be based on how her testimony here correlated with her statement, hence they don‚Äôt want her to read it. But everyday she contradicts her statement and chops and changes"

1535531875804400,36:36,Lorna Kavanagh,.... the commission is a serious affair. alot is at stake to get to the truth. Many poor people are suffering because of state capture.
1535531879953226,36:40,Jerry sigidane,Mentor'plz don't be afraid by last day
1535531919477336,37:20,The Truth,"@Thando, it‚Äôs just a sarcastic joke. It‚Äôs just funny how the bar is low these days. If your former president has standard 6, u t more than qualified with matric these days lol"
