1554193317370622,20:16,Magda Seguin,He even gave an interview saying he don't know who paid for it
1554193341500630,20:40,Grayboy how,I saw now evidence will be given about Ace getting 80million ...and the ANC defends him
1554193367995506,21:06,Quintin Jacobs,the CR17 faction is now vulnerable

1554193503920289,23:22,Cameron Kim,"@Desmond Masilela ""She"" is not involved in the corruption"
1554193516278409,23:34,Magda Seguin,It is beyond my understanding how anyone can think that Judge Zondo would allow illegal inspections...
1554193538236280,23:56,Desmond Masilela,@Cameron Kim. I thought it was Mantashe's wife?
1554193562035229,24:20,Cameron Kim,@Quintin Jacobs The water problem is the result of the useless ANC and DA politician . The last proper dams were build in Apartheid
1554193606770932,25:05,peter pott,"@seguin, the chair asked about it yesterday. no one produced a search warrant. and he warned them of not conducting their investigation like that. hence illegal"

1554193808862869,28:27,peter pott,"@seguin. it's not DCJ Condo who allowed it. he is an astute judge. the legal team lead by SC Pretorius did. he rebuked that behaviour. it's this kind of errors that make ""suppose criminal"" free"
1554193822757063,28:41,Cameron Kim,‚Äã@Quintin Jacobs In 1992 the NP planned a water pipeline from the Orange river to 3 WD . The ANC then said it was wasting money

1554193944495648,30:43,Quintin Jacobs,Robert so tell me why did the DA charge ordinary folk more water than business in the Cape
1554193950045487,30:48,Cameron Kim,"@Quintin Jacobs the WC is short of water since 1996 after the mass emigration from the EC , in 10 years time the water situation in the Cape will be critical even under better than av rainfall"
1554193953629804,30:52,Magda Seguin,I remember in Mr Mlambo's previous testimony he alluded to implicated people being notified
1554193954781023,30:53,Mathieuw N. Muyenga,It's not only the voice. .. but she is just beautiful. She deserves a marriage certificate. Send the address. ....
1554193969289514,31:08,peter pott,"@seguin, I listened to the proceeding yesterday, they just did. and as I said , DCJ Zondo discouraged that behaviour. warning them that from now henceforth, all investigations must follow the lawn"
1554193981025115,31:19,Quintin Jacobs,Robert if you think there is a plug in the dam then you would be the only one
1554193990933909,31:29,Cameron Kim,@Quintin Jacobs The DA is same as ANC and EFF
1554194039849368,32:18,Quintin Jacobs,Cameron Kim you so right but the DA led government here used the water crisis the milk the ordinary person

1554194093198498,33:11,Magda Seguin,ALL implicated people are kept abreast of all proceedings that affect them...The onus is on them to respond...TIMEOUSLY...not like Mama Action who waited more than a month to respind
1554194100475730,33:19,Desmond Masilela,And who is patrick Mlambo?
1554194101201193,33:19,Quintin Jacobs,how can the DA charge me R 130 for a 500 mm copper pipe from the mains into my property every month - a connection fee

1554194237942238,35:36,Cameron Kim,@Robert Russell The DA is just as quilty as the ANC. They never addressed the water problem coming and that all were aware of since 1994
1554194242054436,35:40,Desmond Masilela,@Thando Nkutha. I see thank you.

1554196218436086,1:08:36,peter pott,@seguin. it's easy. you perform a lifestyle audit. this commission wouldn't last a month. They explain how the got what they have.
1554196261678690,1:09:20,Cameron Kim,"@psyfrequency Techno NO, it is the people who voted blindly for the ANC"
1554196272970402,1:09:31,James,"Warrant or not is irrelevant. What is most relevant is that none of this parties were in a position to award any ""contract"" to Bosasa"

1554196468763083,1:12:47,Magda Seguin,I font know why South Africans are not outraged by the ANC making the country a failed state
1554196469354814,1:12:47,James,@Thando Nkutha i agree with you. But you first need to demonstrate an illegal action. Gwede was SG of ANC. He was not in a position to provide any tender to Bosasa. So what's the illegal relationship?
1554196472567913,1:12:50,Desmond Masilela,This guy was trying to hide some INFO

1554196539557183,1:13:57,MEZL,Give credit to this man. He's Very articulate & uses language & turns of phrase that suggests he has extreme clarity of thought before he answers. More educated than many people I know. I'm impressed

1554197042316557,1:22:20,Desmond Masilela,@Dimakatso Tshinaba. Ayi i dont think so. but rather let me not judge.
1554197043328765,1:22:21,carnoth ngomane,@Thando Nkutha yes its mediocrity at its best
1554197055284782,1:22:34,James,"@African Refugee the DA wanted to bring charges against people like Gwede and Nomvula, but they cant, there was never any tender/contract given by either of them 2 Bosasa. Where's the corruption then?"
1554197081666515,1:23:01,Desmond Masilela,@Dimakatso Tshinaba. Thank you. Why is that if I may ask
1554197115153209,1:23:33,Derek Main,"@makhosi nobhatyi You are using the ANC strategy of ""If you tell a lie often enough, the people will start believing it""."
1554197163500066,1:24:21,Briony French,Only a fool signs something when behaving illegally. Which is why Gavin Watsons signature isnt on one document....
1554197170414235,1:24:28,carnoth ngomane,when you comment out of hatred you usually ignore the facts and allow your hatred to speak
1554197175451319,1:24:33,Briony French,He tricked Agrezzi and them into signing. According to Gwede his upgrades where done by whomever the ANC got to do them... He didnt know he was getting Bosasa upgrades apparently.
1554197205830250,1:25:04,Briony French,But I dont believe anyone I can barely hear when they speak... he mumbles like a drunk and so I dont trust him...
1554197341013356,1:27:19,makhosi nobhatyi,"Briony French this Bosasa thing was mafia within the state taking advantage to blackmail people such as Mantashe, it clear they use to take strong people into the mud"
1554197361056034,1:27:39,Desmond Masilela,@Dimakatso Tshinaba. Are you no f/b?
1554197368038418,1:27:46,carnoth ngomane,"@Briony French i think if the relationship was reciprocal Bosasa must have benefited from Gwede, now the question is what did Bosasa get from Gwede for the upgrades"
1554197434522248,1:28:52,makhosi nobhatyi,I think Mantashe when he comes to clarify matters then we connect dots
1554197444754836,1:29:02,kleophas max,this is how whites operate...if they can beat them the accuses them any wrong doing.....the big fish of this capture are the opperneihms who are running equal with the ruppers....and own a private air
1554197477241706,1:29:36,Derek Main,@James According to Agrizzi they were either being paid a monthly fee by Bosasa or receiving other benefits eg. home security.
1554197517219348,1:30:15,Enrico Abrahams,same thing around hlaudi... what did he give bosasa that they paid 1m to his lawyers
1554197650432717,1:32:28,Magda Seguin,ALL our SOE's are bankrupt because of the ANC but people still believe in flying fairies...it seems like the betrayal of a population is a narcissistic desire of the abused people

1554200413774206,2:18:32,James,@Sofia Sofia there is no point to the last 2 days. Irrelevant evidence
1554200433770614,2:18:52,Magda Seguin,I think Apartheid succeeded in making South Africans hate each other
