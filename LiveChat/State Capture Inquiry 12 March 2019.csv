1552379924309344,1:04:34,makhosi nobhatyi,@kapn krunch you don’t have knowledge how does he behave in a meeting so I believe Ramaphosa was questioning other decision and was not happy with Zuma response at parliament but defeated by majority

1552380180745997,1:08:50,Eslon Eslon,"@Albert Noah, but what triggered his emotions to that extent really?"
1552380190018997,1:09:00,Musa Bakiti,Eskom is inthe pocket of Ramaphosa and family as Bosasa in the pocket of Zuma and family and Bidvest in the pocket Helen Zille
1552380228808008,1:09:39,Magda Seguin,"This man is not at Eskom anymore,he was drawn into nefarious deeds,I understand why he is emotional"

1552380447480384,1:13:17,Felix Muyoba,i dont think he is answering the question..
1552380494041525,1:14:03,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi The entire country knew long ago what Zuma was up to because it was widely reported in the media especially with regard to the Guptas.
1552380497539216,1:14:07,Derek Main,The only people who didn't want to see it were the ANC including their leaders (Ramaphosa as well).
1552380533703857,1:14:43,Michael Michael,lo bhuti
1552380554331006,1:15:04,Eslon Eslon,"@Norman Zwane, you must be kidding me. his mom send a note to whom?"

1552380609197760,1:15:58,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main with a nose that huge, you'd be excused for being unsighted you know"

1552380630238101,1:16:19,Magda Seguin,Zuma is a psychotic narcissicist...he doesn't care about people's lives
1552380647794427,1:16:37,Norman Zwane,@Magda Seguin Fecetious. Not funny I concede.
1552380658989225,1:16:48,Derek Main,"@Norman Zwane As I said, ANC supporters wear blinkers"
1552380680529992,1:17:10,Magda Seguin,I am blocking @Norman Zwane he is totally I appropriate...go play elsewhere
1552380707811507,1:17:38,Musa Bakiti,EFF is the party to vote before Karima Brown destroy it
1552380719009825,1:17:48,Michael Michael,I think eff kids needs to understand how to run the country.
1552380722653376,1:17:52,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main He was born that way, never needed to wear them blinkers to be unsighted."
1552380752307347,1:18:21,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane Who is he?
1552380798010388,1:19:07,Magda Seguin,@Derek Main exactly...who is he after all?
1552380798030290,1:19:07,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main Him who was there when Zuma messed up.
1552380826008771,1:19:35,thando cezula,9 wasted years...
1552380850860856,1:20:00,Derek Main,"@Norman Zwane In fact, many people said that Zuma should not be made president of SA as he would destroy the country. Then all the ANC clowns came out in his support and you have the ""Kill for Zuma""."
1552380854944636,1:20:04,Magda Seguin,I see that nobody here are shocked that people died on Gupta mines
1552380870830846,1:20:20,Derek Main,And the rest they say is history - all that was predicted of Zuma came to pass.
1552380899458352,1:20:49,Derek Main,Only the ANC fools couldn't see it. The ANC has a lot to answer for.
1552380910685763,1:21:00,Kapn Krunch,the ANC elected Zuma as president after a rape case that for me is nuff said
1552380939402849,1:21:29,Eslon Eslon,"@Wallace, vote ANC bcos Ramaphosa has started on a right path of correcting and cleaning the mess Zuma left behind."
1552380965527023,1:21:55,thando cezula,The ANC kept Zuma as president after he was found by the Concourt to have violated his Oath Of Office. The ANC at that point was truly broken!
1552380979698308,1:22:09,Kapn Krunch,rhamaphosa gave Zuma a job after all the corruption not exactly the right path
1552380990191489,1:22:20,david jacobs,Spot on @Musa Bakiti
1552381022363160,1:22:51,makhosi nobhatyi,"What we must all remember Zuma put people in the position who will say yes boss if not you are fired, as we all know he changed his cabinet 8 times or 9th"
1552381033028285,1:23:03,Derek Main,@Eslon Eslon The entire ANC is responsible for this mess - why should we vote for them? What happened to collective responsibility?
1552381078852122,1:23:48,Mzalwane Mzala,ANC NEC members moved a vote of no confidence on Zuma twice. It was defeated by his acolytes.
1552381084398472,1:23:53,Felix Muyoba,this guy is just story telling..
1552381105133718,1:24:14,Kapn Krunch,if africa had justice Zuma would be in prison his family and friends would be stripped of their wealth
1552381133732502,1:24:43,Magda Seguin,@makhosi South Africans have short memories...You are right
1552381136434022,1:24:45,Derek Main,@Mzalwane Mzala So the majority of the ANC were happy with Zuma's behaviour.
1552381158303018,1:25:07,Kapn Krunch,because leaders get away with these things the next leaders arent even scared
1552381169076095,1:25:18,Mzalwane Mzala,The ANC at some point had around one million members.
1552381195162028,1:25:44,Magda Seguin,Brian Molefe has a LOT to account for...he was totally captured
1552381203215857,1:25:52,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main Ramatlhodi gave us some insight how Zuma went about his business. From what I gleaned one would have needed real balls to wreck the Zuma train. I do not however condone the silence pact.
1552381219607704,1:26:08,Kapn Krunch,even Mugabe still is walking around with his millions untouched
1552381221414018,1:26:10,Derek Main,@Mzalwane Mzala That's one million fools too many.
1552381257762172,1:26:47,Eslon Eslon,"@Derek Main, Be honest for Cyril is busy taking out Zuma people who corrupted and crippled the state apparatus. The guy is busy look at the bigger picture plz."
1552381268522572,1:26:58,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane Yes - we know the ANC doesn't have balls. They were too happy feeding at the trough to rock the boat.
1552381271401894,1:27:01,Kapn Krunch,who wins the people or the leaders who are still rich
1552381286290771,1:27:15,Musa Bakiti,The only problem with JZ is to work with Indians if he worked with Afrikaaners he would be a hero
1552381308156072,1:27:37,Derek Main,@Eslon Eslon Where was Cyril for the last 7 years?
1552381316151915,1:27:45,Magda Seguin,Winter is coming and Eskom is struggling to keep the lights on...At Nkandla they probably have generators
1552381327328063,1:27:56,Desmond Masilela,You can even read the guys eyes that his a liar.
1552381337718934,1:28:07,Kapn Krunch,Cyril rhamaphosa was given his billions by trevor Manuel 🤣🤣🤣
1552381338051946,1:28:07,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Thando Nkutha yes it is, Ramaphosa join the cabinet after Kgalema motlante stood up against Zuma during Nkandla and expelled of Julius malema and shivhambu he speaks out Zuma support sucked him"
1552381349935619,1:28:19,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main I think the TOP 6 were weaklings, they had fear of losi by calling Zuma out certain privileges. For that, in my book, they aided and are just as guilty as Jacob Zuma."
1552381368579644,1:28:38,Neil Fraser,@Desmond Masilela That's an incorrect assumption on your part.
1552381375798723,1:28:45,Kapn Krunch,he couldn't even make billions himself
1552381377772748,1:28:47,Derek Main,@Mzalwane Mzala I will definitely take on any ANC apologists who try to sugar-coat the destruction the ANC has caused SA. Try to defend it if you can.
1552381385966180,1:28:55,Ollielove Ndumo,Musa Bakiti well said . Zuma is guilty of working with Indian and Glencore poeple in Eskom they we no longer eating.
1552381393857454,1:29:02,Kapn Krunch,he is the result of an African enrichment program

1552382450352355,1:46:40,Neil Fraser,I applaud the those who have been ignoring the racist comments being made by person. Let's keep ignoring him and don't give him a platform to speak his racists comments.
1552382490999328,1:47:20,Thami Zungu,the same commission we are watching is chaired by a Zulu what do you have to say about that @Yose Human ?
1552382491063472,1:47:21,Norman Zwane,"@Mzalwane Mzala I thought that was quite bold at the time, but I was disgusted by how easily the troops could be whipped into line to support Zuma. Jeer I hated those outcomes."

1552382601370338,1:49:10,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi So you're happy to go along with more promises from the ANC. They only promise but don't deliver. Not falling for that again.
1552382612819629,1:49:22,Norman Zwane,@Eslon Eslon I am certainly not denying it. I'm just upset it resulted into nothing.
1552382688915727,1:50:38,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi The only reason Ramaphosa is doing something now is that he realises the ANC is in serious trouble. It's a matter of survival not a moral fortitude.
