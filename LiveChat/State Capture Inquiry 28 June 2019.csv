1561732692613276,6:35:28,Mzalwane Mzala,The apartheid government used control by communists argument to gain sympathy from Western powers during the cold war.
1561732716099264,6:35:51,LYD online tv,@Mzalwane Mzala she thinks it's walk in the park... Thinking of her old privilege when she was protected by JZ
1561732771866811,6:36:47,Dominic Przybylski,USSR didn't support ANC from a philanthropic point of view. Once in power they were expected to repay the soviets. That's why JZ was so desperate to give Putin the nuclear deal.
1561732776074170,6:36:51,Brian Muleya,"@Toni Oliveira...no nonsense no fear approach to leadership, yeah..."
1561732782579250,6:36:58,Mzalwane Mzala,When did the SACP define strategy for the ANC?
1561732785472026,6:37:00,LYD online tv,@Brian Leaver why are they even entertaining the Neo person?

1561732876129072,6:38:31,Millicent Shozi,KQ we have nations in Africa
1561732881553481,6:38:36,Bernard Matolino,"@KQ Proud American Woman He sounds very Shona. But we don't say tribe, we say ethnicity. Never use tribe!!"
1561732901074029,6:38:57,Mzalwane Mzala,The apartheid government had to push a narrative that said black people had no problem with apartheid but the 'struggle' was part of communists' plan to expand their sphere of control.
1561732925408015,6:39:21,Dan Brown,This Witness is in a different league to the previous Dude who knew nothing. The Doctor doesn't even need his notes.
1561732944660861,6:39:40,LYD online tv,@Toni Oliveira the neo person is seeking attention.

1561732977378199,6:40:12,Toni Oliveira,@brian muleya.Absolutely..
1561733007164884,6:40:42,Bernard Matolino,@KQ Proud American Woman As long as you avoid the word tribe. It carries negative connotations sponsored by colonialists and reactionary anthropologists.

1561733094076575,6:42:08,Mzalwane Mzala,@Dominic Przybylski Please don't forget that the ANC was not formed as a party for contesting elections.
1561733125846560,6:42:41,Dominic Przybylski,They have been in elections for the last 25 years.
1561733130453512,6:42:46,Mzalwane Mzala,@Dominic Przybylski Give an email address and we listen to the witness.

1561733268776781,6:45:02,Bernard Matolino,@KQ Proud American Woman Interesting that when you talk of yourself you use ethnicity and when you talk of the witness you use tribe. Just don't do that
1561733279201613,6:45:15,Dominic Przybylski,@Mzalwane Mzala That is just rhetoric as far as I can work out. How can they genuinely be a liberation movement if they have been the government for a quarter of a century?
