1613745209871461,2:29:32,Cƒ∫iffy Dube,Heather durr..i think the DCJ is asking a pertinent question in this instance
1613745232215699,2:29:53,Lee D. Hendrix,...Legally oriented people are sweethearts as business executives.
1613745255427884,2:30:18,Brightwell Kunene,"@Sal SA Its only a proposal to the Board, who are advised of the situation as it stands. Its not a legal document"
1613745261988985,2:30:24,Blake Yogi,you guys still entertain that Google lawyer. I mean the surname says it all.. Durr!!
1613745283716623,2:30:45,Heather Durr,"I as a lawyer with a BA LLB and 30 years experience accept her answer unequivocally. No magic required, it is no Companies Act central"

1613745295803751,2:30:56,Heather Durr,*Not
1613745307665093,2:31:09,Brightwell Kunene,@Sal SA Its a matter of complying with processes rather than contracting
1613745333976232,2:31:36,WC,Ms D is cornered now ...
1613745354659822,2:31:56,Brightwell Kunene,"@Sal SA You should not be too legalistic, its still business after all"
1613745355693687,2:31:57,Blake Yogi,what Face value? cos there was no value there
1613745359239131,2:32:00,Sal SA,"@Brightwell. No sir, the resolution is the most important document to come from the Board. That is what executives and officials follow."
1613745365115481,2:32:08,Lee D. Hendrix,...A company secretary is the company personified.
1613745372332239,2:32:12,Lerato Moleke,"@Karel, I also noticed that make-up look on DCJ "
1613745391165321,2:32:32,Heather Durr,What kind of legal advice-you mean she can draft mergers and acquisitions the way I do as well as make Forex applications
1613745409806588,2:32:53,brutos17,"Lock up Zuma RSA needs the R500 Billion, Zuma stole with his Indian friends!!! People are hungry!!!üò†üò†"

1613745449527710,2:33:32,Brightwell Kunene,@Sal SA you clutching at straws now. The resolution is reached by the Board having applied their minds. They new what the situation was and gave the managers the authority to act as they did
1613745470179812,2:33:51,Sal SA,@Brightwell. These are legal issues and have to be very clear. Now we sitting with a problem because people don't think its important/legalistic!
1613745474397599,2:33:57,Cƒ∫iffy Dube,hahaha...Heather Durr...a company secretary gives legal advice to the board on different matters and not mergers and acquisitions
1613745484566934,2:34:06,Diane Louw,not could of you SHOULD OF
1613745520361039,2:34:41,Blake Yogi,Ms Daniels warning of implications isnt second guessing
1613745522350209,2:34:43,Brightwell Kunene,@Sal SA In any case did they raise the question themselves as to why the proposal did not mention who the proposed owner was?
1613745526911198,2:34:48,Blake Yogi,you didnt alert them
1613745529036385,2:34:51,Diane Louw,she was the legal person weejy
1613745545566456,2:35:05,Heather Durr,@cliffy my point exactly-cant the execs read English
1613745545602981,2:35:05,Karel Gulston,Looks like Advocate Seleka the Chair of the commission today and the DCJ the evidence leader.
1613745555981180,2:35:17,Blake Yogi,wow
1613745556755150,2:35:18,Martha Sello,@Ndumie how is he going after Zuma cos this commission was set up by Zuma himself and Madonsela?

1613745613378535,2:36:15,Cƒ∫iffy Dube,sizwe it's because the witness is not being truthful
1613745642846064,2:36:44,Blake Yogi,you shouldve made doubly sure at that time Ms Daniels
1613745644534778,2:36:45,Ndumie Ndlovu,@Martha Sello do you really think the current president had nothing to do with all these things that are happening
1613745650566750,2:36:53,Diane Louw,she in previous sessions said she was part of legal and drafted some papers etc
1613745659039072,2:37:02,Teunis van Ree,@Diane Louw not could of or should of but could have and should have üôÑ

1613745744961532,2:38:26,Brightwell Kunene,"@Sal SA Was it illegal to deal with Guptas then? No, so they were doing no wrong. No need to hide anything if they were not engaging in any illegal act. Zondo said he see no illegality now"
