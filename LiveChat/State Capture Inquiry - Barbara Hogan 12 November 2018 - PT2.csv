1542031359110230,2:04:58,Marvel Ramatshela,"Ramaphosa, Jeff Radebe and P Motsepe are brothers-in-laws. I don't see Cyril brave enough to fire him."

1542031478203805,2:06:57,Timothy Tyrus,Well Ramaphosa said he would take his son to jail himself if suspected something was wrong.... so it should not be a problem to merely fire his brother in law
