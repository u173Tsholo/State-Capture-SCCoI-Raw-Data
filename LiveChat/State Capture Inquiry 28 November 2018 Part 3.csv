1543416168979074,34:04,Jaco Wolmarans,SA is ungovernable and will always be.

1543416526236880,40:02,AFRICA AZANIA,"yr vote is yr voice,if u dont vote u r speechless,lol"
1543416666619910,42:22,Luckey Binali,none of the parties make sense for me to vote for them
1543416722967037,43:19,AFRICA AZANIA,so u trying to say u lost hope?
1543416742900426,43:38,dave east,so voting so black people can control their own future isnt worth voting 4
1543416857873936,45:33,dave east,voting so we can control and have institutions built and governed by our children is worth 1 minute ticketing a box
1543416870795485,45:46,Luckey Binali,exactly ANC will rule forever as long as we still have paranoid or gullible people who
1543416999345092,47:55,dave east,vote eff they want land and control to nationalize institutions so the prople benefit from the resources
1543417361723601,53:57,Ewald Kruger,@Luckey Binali Agree fully. Only reason to vote for the DA is the chances of getting service delivery is better ðŸ˜ƒ
1543417379072877,54:15,Calm Relaxation Music Chilled,ANC is no longer the same.
1543417496747894,56:12,dave east,@Khothatso Khiba ANC is not for black people. they have had 25 years and we south africans are poor while white and indians are rich of our land and resources
1543417684562684,59:20,Luckey Binali,your vote is your voice is the crap that politicians use to control pple but once u vote them in they don't recognise your voice nomore. so why would I waste my time and energy voting
1543417874985876,1:02:30,Ewald Kruger,Should one not think more pragmatically @Luckey Binali? Only reason I would vote for the DA is not because of their policies and values bla-bla but chances potholes will be fixed etc.
1543418043315460,1:05:19,Katlego Mapheto,"EFF for africans , our roots. revolution!"

1543418367378156,1:10:43,Katlego Mapheto,@The Explore Store violence ke mmago..where did you see EFF doing violent conduct?
1543418427975191,1:11:43,Ewald Kruger,ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ he will pitch with his own @Andre Gerber
1543418447554582,1:12:03,smanga mpilo,It seems like all departments need to be evaluated an see whether those who holds those high positions are qualified
1543418494888264,1:12:50,wisani wiseman manganyi,I guess majority of them are not qualified for those positions
1543418545699513,1:13:41,Wesley M,corruption broke South Africa.
1543418556885013,1:13:52,Andre Gerber,"@Ewald Kruger he did not have counsel the other day, he did ask Maleka to be his Adv a while ago"

1543418601987383,1:14:37,Wildthing,SAA comes to mind
1543418686607555,1:16:02,Ewald Kruger,He asked Maleka? ðŸ˜€ @Andre Gerber
1543418794731967,1:17:50,Andre Gerber,yes Maleka told the commission the day he wanted Maleka recused
1543418842351937,1:18:38,Ewald Kruger,ðŸ˜€ can't stop laughing @Andre Gerber
1543418922782070,1:19:58,Some guy,wats up suckers
1543418924562206,1:20:00,Andre Gerber,thatis one of the reasons he accepted Maleka after the break
1543418981213654,1:20:57,Andre Gerber,you can watch on Manyi's 2nd day
1543418987104975,1:21:02,Some guy,what causes eyes to look in 2 different directions?
1543419007201953,1:21:23,Nkosikhona Ginya,"yeah maleka was trying to explain that he has no issues against Manyi as he suggested, and added that in some previous cases Manyi once aproached him, just that he was not available."
1543419046527680,1:22:02,Ewald Kruger,"Will have a look, must have missed that, thanks! @Andre Gerber"
1543419108661629,1:23:04,peter pott,"fmr president Zuma is so astute. he never told people why he fired them. they are just guessing,even this day. others he says I promote you, I deploy you to another department"
1543419126666181,1:23:22,Andre Gerber,thats the reason I said he was ignoring Maleka on the 1st day
1543419525758025,1:30:01,Ewald Kruger,"ðŸ˜€ @Nkosikhona Ginya. Poor Jimmy, his past seems to be following him like his shadow ðŸ˜ƒ"
1543419542175181,1:30:18,peter pott,"gents, see you tomorrow. I am taking my beautiful advocate lady to the doctor, for her to be fine tomorrow"
