1542703441376406,41:55,Athmanand Singh,The Millions of Rands that have lined the pockets of the Tender preneurs and Zuma and Gupta contacts have deprived millions of our country men of homes and basic services.

1542703634014821,45:08,Athmanand Singh,PG is giving evidence that will show that that the state was captured.
1542703637640447,45:11,Mfundo Veerasamy,South Africa is on a decline curve that was initiated by Zuma
1542703675024969,45:48,Nelson Musoliwa,It is obvious that Collective Leadership history in ANC never saw the light of the day during Zuma era. It was only about him and his friends guptas included
1542703675978190,45:49,solethu matrose,@Mfundo Veerasamy we do not have 5hours of how things work. if he just gave evidence in a well prepared manner he would have done so by last month

1542703722539146,46:36,peter pott,"so minister, tells his counsel what he wants to talk about by setting an agenda for himself. What a joke? we tell you what we want to know minister, you are exposed"
1542703761071439,47:14,socabonita,no evidence here but rather shows Zuma was incompetent nje
1542703791106800,47:45,Mfundo Veerasamy,"Yesterday Mr Pravin explained the structure of the role players of the state capture and now he is dissecting the nitty gritties, lets be prudent and learn as much as we can"

1542703800802370,47:54,Mpho Kgomo,"@peter pott you picked it up jah neh this is dangerous, its like they are eating from the palm of his hand."
1542703824934750,48:18,nhla xwale,what talking about ?
1542703827126917,48:21,solethu matrose,@socabonita the ministers are outsourced to do that
1542703834541644,48:28,dave east,guy do you know that the IMF is telling the South African government to stop expropriation of land without compensation
1542703835694754,48:29,peter pott,"No one can do a thing to Zuma, he carried instructions from HQ. He has always been a loyal disciple of the movement"

1542703896977382,49:31,tienienel,Some people dont understand the finer detail of state capturing. Rather listen to his evidence.
1542703899567751,49:33,Mpho Kgomo,"@Louis Eloff, yes what did you discover?"
1542703915979745,49:49,nhla xwale,me I am lose now
1542703926849310,50:00,Keenan Fernandez,"Dave I am fortunate enough to share an environment with all races, your general opinion is rather misguided"

1542703942153454,50:16,Houws Houlinou,He's connecting the dots everyone in South Africa could only speculate on if you actually listen
1542703944734887,50:18,Mfundo Veerasamy,"@ solethu matrose, this capturing of the state was not a two minute noddle, it was well orchestrated and the executive master minds were at play, remember Pravin is human he has to work with tHEM STIL"
1542703944984131,50:18,peter pott,@myburgh☺that's is head quarters. hence he had to finish his term as head of the organization
1542703997148156,51:11,nhla xwale,this man mix everything

1542704045766337,51:59,Mpho Kgomo,"@nhla xwale , he is trained we are dealing with an Indian."
1542704049499317,52:03,Singi Mathebula,mob psychology is at stake here. Pravin never pronounced before hand that he is coming with a bomb and every one must take cover. Its us not him😂
1542704064388642,52:18,Wesley M,Pete pott. i agree. Jacob Zuma did not create the state capture concept. the ANC did. Zuma is gone the State is still captured.
1542704074741327,52:28,solethu matrose,"@Mfundo Veerasamy the is a investigation that will be done by commision I sure the evidence will save lots of DATA,MONEY,TIME,and get us convictions. not this how the rand was in 2015 how the municipa"

1542704169009781,54:02,dave east,we need to stop pretending that these values from india arent brought in from india. we black people need to deal with this NONSENSE
1542704172408717,54:06,solethu matrose,so now PG is saying Zuma appointed him even though he(PG) was not fit?
1542704208355718,54:42,Keenan Fernandez,"Yes we all know indians have a caste system which divides the indians in four groups if I am not mistaken, but How do you get to all indians are criminals - Like saying all dogs are violent???"
1542704212410304,54:46,Houws Houlinou,@dave east The Indians you so blatantly discriminated against were brought here as slaves and still they outwitted you. What does that say about you?
1542704218768660,54:52,Mpho Kgomo,@Thando nothing new thus far
1542704248809194,55:22,peter pott,"Trevor, longest serving and yet. blacks remain poor, tin houses abound and unemployment record high. big deal they say! stop telling how long you serve, it makes poor black people nauseous"

1542704314663511,56:28,dave east,africans never enslaved black people but indians did particapate in the enslavement of Africans and thats a FACT. DO you want proof
1542704335250152,56:48,Peter Sant,sometimes it's useless to use racist statements to defend corrupt people
1542704337269361,56:51,Wesley M,i don't think the EFF has got something on Pravin. they just have a grudge against him.
1542704346157416,57:00,Keenan Fernandez,So ask yourself this question are all dogs violent? Or for example will all men go BOLD when they are older - The answer is no - Stop Generalizing. I am not interested in your proof as it misguided
1542704348152250,57:02,Sandile Mabika,prime minister of republic is not making sense at all.
1542704361191794,57:15,Houws Houlinou,@Mpho Kgomo I am getting sick of this Dave racist
1542704371461563,57:25,Trucker Trucker,"Nuclear was Mbeki's project and it was going West, Zuma made it go to Russia and they rather settled for renewables IPP which cost more than nuclear but delivers less power and no industrialization."
1542704443339090,58:37,Keenan Fernandez,"Dave, I am saying this again, I am not interested in you Proof, and I don`t think anyone else would be interested - Your information is compromised"

1542704935086275,1:06:49,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,Does anyone remember under whose watch the SAA fleet was sold and why???
1542704954950501,1:07:09,dave east,keenan im not soeaking to you move on and stop being needy. move on
1542704960124799,1:07:13,Sandile Mabika,"mr know it all , tell us who sold our aircraft?"
1542705001713260,1:07:55,solethu matrose,@Athmanand Singh even if he was on struggle before universe came to existance all we need is evidence that guptas captured state
1542705015425186,1:08:09,Job Mokolutlo,@Sandile. Go ask Dudu Myeni
1542705017549171,1:08:11,Sne Mdletye,Dudu Myeni
1542705030852222,1:08:24,Athmanand Singh,Many years ago there was an American who was the CEO of SAA and at that time SAA was making a profit.
1542705032538728,1:08:26,peter pott,"this Trevor Manuel he is praising got us into this agreement. tell the truth minister. and from whom are we leasing from? SAA can tell us, or treasury can tell us that, he responds. of course you know"
1542705057886933,1:08:51,Sandile Mabika,this cabal is fooling us.
1542705065272543,1:08:59,Ntokozo Cele,Trevor Manuel must be called too here along with his wife
1542705079979784,1:09:13,dave east,bkack people are in this deprieved positions because you love to play too much if you want proof of anything ive said ask me
1542705098842963,1:09:32,peter pott,"@singh, he fooled us. He sold our planes and we saw money in our account and we thought we made profit."
1542705114076712,1:09:48,Trucker Trucker,@Thando Nkutha You're saying a lot but you're not saying anything.
1542705125040809,1:09:59,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,So Ms Myeni wanted to buy aircraft for SAA and why is that so wrong?
1542705126754229,1:10:00,Job Mokolutlo,@Singh. How many Black Africans benefitted from the profits made by the US CEO?
1542705193968464,1:11:07,Ntokozo Cele,Buying an aircraft would have upset-ed WMC coz they only want SAA to lease aircrafts...
1542705198155247,1:11:12,Trucker Trucker,@Thando Nkutha The nuclear program only became a problem when word surfaced that the tender would be awarded to our BRICS partners Russia.
1542705200300644,1:11:14,solethu matrose,the only time PG mentioned guptas was when he said He is not for SALE.
1542705240114729,1:11:53,peter pott,when Zuma along dudu were saying: we want our planes black. they were chastised for disturbing the capitalist.
1542705243630778,1:11:57,Ntokozo Cele,Is Pravin suffering from amnesia? he seem to forget a lot of pivotal information
1542705276534021,1:12:30,Sthakathi Khumalo,peter pott WMC is a disease that clever blacks keep on defending here!!

1542705308056649,1:13:01,peter pott,this man is lying. people from president come and make presentation you as a minister you never inquired who made that presentation?
1542705309276789,1:13:03,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,"I don't understand PG, he seems to think SA can't afford anything, can't afford Nuclear, can't afford aircraft for SAA. Kanti who was he working for, South Africa or private interests?"
1542705319804610,1:13:13,Job Mokolutlo,@Nkutha. I so hope you could move on from your toxic dialogue with this guy. You are much better than that!
1542705324723176,1:13:18,Blessing Mabena,Some of you can't even remember things that happen in 2018 January

1542705386714385,1:14:20,Sthakathi Khumalo,"South Africa can afford to get Nucleur, the matter has become political and the rulling elites White capital doesnt want this"
1542705411692573,1:14:45,peter pott,"@em D, I like this commission, it's exposing those perceived to be astute and honest. look how he struggles to hide and dodge questions😀😀"

1542706424957100,1:29:32,Sivuyile Myataza,@solethu matrose... the Guptas are just small fish. They are taking only a small fraction of the country's GDP.
1542706444592769,1:29:52,Sivuyile Myataza,...The real devils are the initial bastards who volunteered to bribed (and still continue to) our leaders (Ramaphosa included) in making us believe that capitalism will solve our nation's problems.
