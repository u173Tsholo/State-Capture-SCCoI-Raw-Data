1581424510752978,27:15,Bernard Matolino,@Bunon Solomon Apparently Adv Maleka was implicated in direct ways by this commission and had to step down. It involved his brother or something

1581424712148545,30:37,Derek Main,@Mashao Mohale That makes her look guilty.

1581425513925005,44:00,Dominic Przybylski,@Alex Mlangeni Tenders are essential. It's the people who don't keep to the rules which are the problem. BEE partners also mean that we have to pay more than we would have to without BEE.
1581425521645166,44:06,Hennie Cloete,@Alex Mlangeni-that will start the turnaround in SA
1581425526087891,44:11,Colleen Arezio,"I make a correction. She is dumb, but over confident in herself hence all her mistakes, examples and stalling."
1581425592129408,45:17,Mtokozisi Baleni,@Alex the point is we cant close tenders...lets arrest and jail the corrupt because @home affairs. municipality all its corruption too
1581425610119659,45:36,Dominic Przybylski,BEE means that everybody (including the poor) have to pay for a small elite to become super-rich.
1581425620337536,45:45,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@Mtokozisi Baleni well said
1581425621664393,45:47,Phillip Cwazibe,@ Dominic Przybylski Correct. No reason to buy Michellin Tyres from a BEE entity if could be purchased from a distributor or directly from the factory.
1581425637696535,46:03,David Tuer,They (saart) invented a spurious reason for disqualifying Lufthansa.
1581425667611746,46:33,Joyful Technologies,"I understand, but the people who spoil these tenders ae VERY GREEDY.If we can stop this greed,the, tenders are very essential"
1581425702143895,47:07,Derek Main,@David Tuer Yes - they had already lined up JK/AAR and needed excuses to drop the other bidders.

1581425790238432,48:35,Mtokozisi Baleni,We need to get our country back from all these corrupt political deployees We are sick of it. police @ hawks keep on failing us
1581425853759300,49:38,Derek Main,@Mtokozisi Baleni That would mean voting the ANC out at the next election. It's the only way.
1581425877105495,50:02,Phillip Cwazibe,"@Mtokozisi Baleni ​ Indeed, we need to get our country back. It is how we vote."

1581425929897661,50:55,David Tuer,@Mtokozisi Baleni - Too true. CR needs to form a task force to focus on bring corrupt employees (and Directors) to book.
1581425931798143,50:57,Noxolo Tshabangu,@dominic przybylski just sounds like you are making every excuse to not have BEE as a policy... understandable only because you may not be a champion of redress.
1581425939717179,51:05,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@Nkululeko Mdluli she will get a Zuma type of medical letter lol
1581425940289099,51:06,Thabani Mthethwa,This is embarrasing in a highest level. This thing of deploying people on positions they dont qualify for is bad
1581425941831102,51:07,Dominic Przybylski,What is happening with Dudu's civil court trial with OUTA?
1581425946449411,51:11,Derek Main,@Gareth Hellyar Tehre were 40+ parties contesting the last election - take your pick.
1581425956498957,51:22,Phillip Cwazibe,@ Nkululeko Mdluli ​ Dudu Myeni wont come.
1581425971714279,51:36,Person of interest,"oh right, I remember now about her appearance at this meeting, this is crucial, she swooped in (maybe in that selfsame cape) to save SAAT from the boards shocking decision."
1581425987306367,51:52,Ricus Ellis,"As long as the ANC party is in control of Government, we will not be able to prevent this Grand Theft we have had for the past several years"
1581426013234019,52:19,Derek Main,@Noxolo Tshabangu The BEE we have at the moment is not redressing anything - just making a few corrupt individuals very rich.
1581426037322936,52:42,desley meyer,true story
1581426048447877,52:53,Derek Main,@Gareth Hellyar That's a defeatist attitude.
1581426058488103,53:04,Dominic Przybylski,You may think differently.
1581426073026858,53:18,Mtokozisi Baleni,i think we need a President like Trump who comes from business and sort all this nonsense this party politics is get us norwhere
1581426103200642,53:47,Derek Main,@Mtokozisi Baleni Careful what you wish for - you might get it.
1581426105003852,53:49,Nkululeko Mdluli,"Yes some ppl will make sure that they never come,and when rulings r made against them ,they will say they were never given a chance to state their side of the story."
1581426125556059,54:11,Ria Sokiri,mumbling
1581426125640432,54:11,Gareth Hellyar,Is corruption another word for transformation? Noxolo Tshabangu.
1581426128642413,54:14,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,"@Derek Main defeatist attitude ? May be , but this is what is called democracy."
1581426145059340,54:30,Thabani Mthethwa,@Mtokozisi Baleni yes we have that president currently. Check what happening in the country
1581426145156994,54:30,David Tuer,@Mtokozisi Baleni - That's a scary thought.
1581426197316072,55:22,Derek Main,@Dirk vd Westhuyzen So let me get this straight - we'll keep on voting for a party that been proven to be corrupt to the core because they are a big party? Ridiculous.
1581426211169925,55:36,Noxolo Tshabangu,@derek main correct... it’s not the policy but the people who run schemes to loot. And these are both black and whites

1581426256022795,56:21,Dominic Przybylski,"The problem with communism is that it considers economics to be zero sum i.e. for some people to get rich other people must get poorer. Capitalism, if you understand economics, means both sides gain."
1581426263710600,56:29,Noxolo Tshabangu,@ Gareth hellyar you are being willfully ignorant
1581426278503458,56:43,Derek Main,@Noxolo Tshabangu Yes of course - corruption knows no colour.

1581426310273908,57:15,Chosen One,There is tension between Ms Hofmeyr and Ms Memela.
1581426315068461,57:21,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski What - the trickle-down effect. What a joke.
1581426318786529,57:24,Noxolo Tshabangu,@derek main there’s no issues with BEE then
1581426336504436,57:41,Chosen One,You can cut it with a knife
1581426344937732,57:50,SS Mbana,why is Memela getting stuck as to how to answer some questions?
1581426349318018,57:55,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@Derek Main the monster ANC will one day destroy itself. ...and the country.
1581426358524775,58:03,Dominic Przybylski,@Derek Main Basic economics - please read up on 'comparative advantage' then get back to me.
1581426367050980,58:12,Derek Main,"@Noxolo Tshabangu Not in principle - in fact, it's necessary. But what we have is a perversion that favours the corrupt."
1581426373229807,58:18,Mtokozisi Baleni,@ David maybe it will take a scary thing to happen to change to happen(jail the corrupted and corrupted)
1581426385567219,58:30,Ricus Ellis,"The problem is the Party Political system we have We should have a system where we vote not along party lines, but for Individuals who by definition must conform to certain criteria."

1581426405055055,58:50,Bernard Matolino,Flirting will get you nowhere the DCJ is turning on her
1581426416838868,59:02,Chris Mayer,The ANC is a huge liability to this country. Their corrupt leaders should not only be sentenced for corrupt activities but for treason.
1581426450870162,59:36,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@Chris Mayer The ANC is a moral hazard
1581426451782538,59:37,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski The corruption we see in BEE is symptomatic of the greed of capitalism.
1581426457870863,59:43,Person of interest,"This is how JZ was with his evidence leader, just giving them nothing, and taking hours to say it."
1581426479652650,1:00:05,Granny Mokwena,the ANC is a mafia in suits
1581426482870391,1:00:08,Thulani Bukani,"This lady is a clear ANC cadre. Making all of us black people look incompetent. Yases, ANC iyasicinezela maan"
1581426502222301,1:00:27,Dominic Przybylski,"@Derek Main relying on ""trickle-down"" assumes the people who supposedly benefit from economic success have no innitiative and are somehow excluded from doing anything to help themselves."
1581426502942928,1:00:28,Rusty SpyGoat,I don't agree or support corruption
1581426504218405,1:00:29,Noxolo Tshabangu,@derek main so what do we do? Get rid of the policy?
1581426506920338,1:00:32,Gerda 7,🙊🙉🙈

1581426530234420,1:00:55,Thulani Bukani,So @Stronger Together the DA cares about the people?
1581426551341802,1:01:17,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@Granny Mokwena they not a mafia it is a charlatan paradise party = toxic hazard
1581426571211349,1:01:36,Chosen One,@David Tuer I think a mixture.
1581426604023061,1:02:08,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@Stronger together i would love to see people get property rights is tribal land from the 7 Kings we have
1581426616602861,1:02:21,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski Let's be very clear - the 1% have got it wrapped up. The odds are stacked against anyone else.
1581426623633842,1:02:28,Chosen One,@David Tuer there are people at the extreme ends.
1581426641924204,1:02:47,Dominic Przybylski,"As long as we have a culture which denies the individual and assumes us all to be cows in a herd of cattle, then nobody will do anything for themself but will expect whoever leads to care about them."
1581426648567240,1:02:52,Toibo wa Toibo Antimba,Is this Memela Advocate?
1581426649636794,1:02:53,Person of interest,So how do we vote now?
1581426672949480,1:03:17,funicanz,Is she still giving evidence? Yhoo!!!
1581426682392989,1:03:27,Derek Main,@Noxolo Tshabangu We fix it. Harsh penalties for any transgressors. Nail down the rules so people like Memela can't BS that there are grey zones.
1581426702693545,1:03:48,Hennie Cloete,@Thulani Bukani -if that is true I will apply for my membership card today!!!!
1581426705299140,1:03:51,Gareth Hellyar,"Yes, because she is so long winded."
1581426727173300,1:04:12,Dominic Przybylski,"@Derek Main I'm not a 1% or a 99%. I don't identify myself by race, religeon or gender. I am just me and can look after myself. If you can't then that's your problem."
1581426730539931,1:04:16,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski I think we'd do a lot better if we got rid of politicians. They are more trouble than they're worth.
1581426738031543,1:04:23,Person of interest,BOOM!
1581426750373790,1:04:35,Anne M.,"@Toibo wa Toibo Antimba Yes, she's an advocate"

1581426771608571,1:04:56,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski I'm looking after myself but I also have a conscience and can't stand the injustice.
1581426783222562,1:05:08,Kevin Simon,Progress report is a colonial idea.
1581426799923497,1:05:25,Derek Main,"@Dominic Przybylski I say that if the wealthy can't grow a conscience, then we'll have to legislate one for them."
1581426800971203,1:05:26,Person of interest,DCJ Who are they reporting to? Adv M NOT ME NOT ME

1581426892590289,1:06:56,FieliesSA,I'm of the opinion that these people believe they are innocent as they don't have the capacity to comprehend how destructive their policies and leaderships were...
1581426901899926,1:07:07,Botshelo Nkosi_Made,Rule 3.3
1581426903445704,1:07:09,Gerda 7,That is why she is where she is...no progress!!!

1581426921917507,1:07:27,Granny Mokwena,does she even know 3.3

1581426949690579,1:07:55,John Fagan,send her to Jail..been caught out
1581426957564365,1:08:02,Chosen One,@David Tuer I like the idea of We The People having power in every decision the state makes.
1581426960924839,1:08:05,John Fagan,while the country suffers
1581426964544974,1:08:09,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski Since when are the 1% governed by the same rules as us? They will never see the inside of a courtroom no matter what crimes they commit.
1581426964884595,1:08:09,Botshelo Nkosi_Made,no she is acting like she doesn't know
1581426994387254,1:08:39,noordster1,Send her to jail in that J&B Durban July outfit
1581426995547420,1:08:40,Anne M.,"Plus, she's an advocate"
1581427006003074,1:08:51,Granny Mokwena,I mean in what basis a rule 3.3 is issued?
1581427035102819,1:09:20,Noxolo Tshabangu,@derek main glad you think we should fix it... I believe the same. But fix it “so people like Malema can’t BS...” ? I’m more worried about the Markus Joosters of this world. Malema has way less power
1581427038914161,1:09:24,Cyril Nyiko,@strong together i believe you know better that most of the things we are using in today's life was developed by blacks
1581427042030263,1:09:27,Anne M.,@Granny Mokwena When somebody claims somebody else did something wrong.

1581427086004544,1:10:11,David Tuer,@Dominic Przybylski @Derek Main - To have a conscience you need a belief of what is right and what is wrong. Simple Hey?
1581427091073615,1:10:16,Chosen One,Human Person?
1581427100722004,1:10:26,Gabisile Mabuza,she is actually implicating herself
1581427115674408,1:10:40,Maryann Diamond,exactly
1581427124515017,1:10:49,Maryann Diamond,she.wants.mercy
1581427128565983,1:10:53,Sthakathi Khumalo,Imbokodo... like the hair!!
1581427143661917,1:11:08,Gabisile Mabuza,there comes thank you chair
1581427144777383,1:11:09,Botshelo Nkosi_Made,@Dirk vd Westhuyzen she thinks he is the same as those who kept quiet when the wrong was being done
1581427173370170,1:11:37,Wildthing,Think Miss Hoffmeyer needs a stress ball.
1581427200563644,1:12:05,Derek Main,@David Tuer Our society rewards psychopaths. So the very wealthy have those traits ie. no conscience and litlle idea of wrong and right.
1581427203202177,1:12:08,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@Botshelo Nkosi_Made a lot of those people could do nothing except losing jobs
1581427214077342,1:12:19,Gabisile Mabuza,its GPUs
1581427253518564,1:12:58,Phillip Cwazibe,Now giving up.
1581427265163312,1:13:10,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski Then by extension I assume you don't worry about people that are extremely poor either.
1581427273133476,1:13:18,Sherwin Peters,defeated
1581427280850907,1:13:26,Wildthing,you were the head at the time so yes it stops with you
1581427314972135,1:13:59,noordster1,Shut the F up and answer the questions
1581427316193211,1:14:01,Kevin Simon,Mama just tell the truth.....It should be easier than trying to cover up any corruption.
1581427338070454,1:14:23,Anne M.,"@Michael Wild Yup, she was the Head of Procurement and paid a very competitive salary for that position."
1581427343409195,1:14:28,Dominic Przybylski,@Derek Main I live very happily on R3500 per month. There are people who think that's too much and call me a privileged white. I'm not going to let them affect my happiness.
1581427347873545,1:14:33,Gerda 7,Stronger together.....peanut butter????!
1581427360993082,1:14:46,Botshelo Nkosi_Made,I think she thought she was going to get there and say it was not me and go scot free. People are given positions and they forget that it takes accountability
1581427383603791,1:15:08,David Tuer,@Derek Main - So we are always going to be ruled by psychopaths and we may as well accept the status quo?
1581427407337851,1:15:32,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@David Tuer sad but true
1581427416877944,1:15:41,Dominic Przybylski,I rule myself. If anybody else thinks they rule me that's their problem.
1581427419533103,1:15:45,Chosen One,@Derek Main the basic question is how can you allocate resources fairly in a society like this?
1581427435049193,1:16:00,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski I put it to you that that is impossible unless you are privileged (eg. you have paid for accommodation etc).
1581427453176510,1:16:18,Gabisile Mabuza,the problem with this woman is that she is defensive instead of answering the questions
1581427462438240,1:16:26,Ben Fraser,Why did she not follow the commission when wrong doing was revealed about her. Point
1581427466605310,1:16:32,Person of interest,"I like you Dominic, you're my kind of people 👍🏾"

1581427510510600,1:17:15,Dominic Przybylski,@Derek Main I own my own house. I pay R2000 per month for internet access and municipal tax. The rest goes on my other expenses.
1581427522003638,1:17:26,Derek Main,@David Tuer Not me - I'm not Dominic. I'm going to shout about it until the cows come home. I think society needs a reset - our values are all wrong. Psychopaths rule and that's got to change.
1581427530538213,1:17:35,Gabisile Mabuza,exactly DCJ
1581427542995925,1:17:47,LangaT Twaise,sick and tired of listening to this
1581427545647215,1:17:50,Wildthing,Concerned please stay focused on the subject and not generalise. otherwise turn of your electric devices. or we will send you back to the dark ages.
1581427546150796,1:17:50,Dirk vd Westhuyzen,@Dominic Przybylski R2000 is a bargain
1581427564372782,1:18:08,Chosen One,@Dominic Przybylski its an illusion.

1581427628296529,1:19:14,Derek Main,@Chosen One I don't have all the answers but I do feel we could do a better job and we should be talking about how.

1581427649423371,1:19:34,Chosen One,@Dominic Przybylski do you think that won't affect you?

1581427712580301,1:20:37,Derek Main,@Chosen One The current inequality is not sustainable and leads to resentment and eventually violence.
1581427720684482,1:20:45,Person of interest,"Derek, all true what you said, bu Dominic is calm in the face of the crap the world is in. I wish I could be like that. We have to stay go to independent news on youtube to see what we can do to fight"

1581427730880045,1:20:55,Chosen One,@Dirk vd Westhuyzen my point exactly. @Dominic Przybylski says he rules himself.
1581427736081744,1:21:01,Botshelo Nkosi_Made,Miss Mbanjwa is putting her own client into the pit they are both digging

1581427798972747,1:22:04,Dominic Przybylski,I'm not going to expect a politician to solve my problems when R30/$. The only person I can rely on is myself.

1581427853438217,1:22:58,Chosen One,@Dirk vd Westhuyzen that will surely affect everyone.

1581430712073541,2:09:56,Dominic Przybylski,DA keep on increasing taxes way above rate of inflation. They are more succesful at expropriation without compensation than ANC or EFF.

1581430898327859,2:13:02,Keith Din,Am pretty sure that Zuma is either working on another strategy to dodge the court appearance irregardless of the issued warrant of arrest. His Nyanga will make that warrant of arrest to simple fade
1581430918455351,2:13:23,Keith Din,The next court appearance
