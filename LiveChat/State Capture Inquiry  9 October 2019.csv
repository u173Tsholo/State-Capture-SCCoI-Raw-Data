1570609787351094,17:00,Derek Main,@Paul Buchel That's what I'm talking about - we're on our own and need to deal with our own issues. Our government is unable or simply doesn't care to administer justice fairly or competently.
1570609802117133,17:14,Derek Main,@Paul Buchel Criminals are running amok in the vacuum.

1570610604783975,30:37,Derek Main,@bongile sango Yes - the cops now are as bad as they were during apartheid. It's difficult for law-abiding citizens to know who to fear more - the criminals or the cops.
