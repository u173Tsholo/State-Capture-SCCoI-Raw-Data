1579526389830664,1:15:32,thulani fadashe,folks painting apartheid as a lesser evil then what State Capture is are smoking something very strong. Apartheid government was responsible for crimes against humanity and they killed to keep going.

1579526787789788,1:22:10,Michael Holmes,one of the reasons it hasn't changed is because of the ANC which demonstrates ANC has similar tactics as apartheid people because they oppress people of colour in SA
1579526791421084,1:22:14,Derek Main,@redriger Howzit Anything exciting today?
1579526845227319,1:23:07,Michael Holmes,No service delivery becomes racist because it perpetuates black poverty
