1618231228685583,23:12,Sanjay Maharaj,anoj's MA always wanted him to be a TV star. said he had the looks for it. bet she did not know that he would be the villain
1618231275041413,23:58,Sanjay Maharaj,"wow. that spierwit stekkie is a walking fossil. must be our incredible health care, here in ZA. or some serious muti"
1618231275416909,23:59,Eleanor Woodman,@Valencia J I am saying so
1618231330043767,24:53,TheQueen V,"@Eleanor oh let him score his political points, his not an actual lawyer"
1618231370649091,25:34,Sanjay Maharaj,he is not even a certified CA(SA) anymore
1618231373385269,25:37,Eleanor Woodman,"@Valencia J thry all s scared of him. Bully of note, no manners"
1618231404389170,26:08,Eleanor Woodman,@Sanjay Maharaj who is not certified?
1618231407607677,26:11,Danile Ngubenyathi,what was the question 🤔
1618231468228253,27:12,Sanjay Maharaj,"looking at Ah-know's tie, I reckon he has earned his stripes"
1618231477390542,27:21,S V 1,@Celeste haha yes she could be hard of hearing if you look at the state of her !
1618231603012275,29:26,Danile Ngubenyathi,where's Adv Seleka
1618231654397117,30:18,Moonchild,"He is such a creep, he makes me want to vomit & that goes for his counsel Cruella Heksie as well"
1618231656331585,30:20,Sanjay Maharaj,Komodo's desk lamps are new. probably brought in to shed some light...
1618231731306716,31:35,Aubrey De Bliquy,So if government obstructs a medicine that prevents Covid death have they not killed 3 times as many as covid?
1618231853605978,33:37,Eleanor Woodman,@Danile Ngubenyathi can't see Seleka
1618231866305024,33:50,Sanjay Maharaj,seems to me that McKinsey was paid for not doing a proper job. neither did they fix Eskom nor did they kill it dead. not a proper job at all.
1618231895442597,34:19,Kevin1,Singh is spinning DCJ in his web !!!
1618231923128367,34:46,Sanjay Maharaj,"ahah, so coconut has finally bowed out behind the curtain of incompetence and having lost the plot. nice!"
1618231929222187,34:53,Jenny Whitewaves,Time spent telling a letter of acceptance Dec 2015 was binding agreement. Now says there was no agreement in June 2016 because the SLA was not signed per Dr Weiss or it may have been signed in Jan
1618231931541639,34:55,Lalitha C,yooooh this woman is loud and irritating 🙉
1618231957444836,35:21,Danile Ngubenyathi,@Woodman I even forgot that is an EL
1618231983773737,35:47,Sanjay Maharaj,I see many unemployed Indians on this forum. why is that?
1618231988522458,35:52,TheQueen V,yes seleka
1618232004074464,36:07,Eleanor Woodman,"@Sanjay Maharaj McKinsey occupied an entire floor for green bank, even had their own parking spots"
1618232090190927,37:34,Danile Ngubenyathi,something is not right to this lawyer of Mr Singh.
1618232095948387,37:39,Sanjay Maharaj,"@eleanor, yes. that is how these parasitic consultancies work. but the foreign Indian consultants do not enjoy the same benefits. Shem. neither are worth a spot on the pavement"
1618232098322238,37:42,Mangalani Mangalani,@Eleanor Woodman Was it not Accenture?
1618232108762880,37:52,fuzile dazana,slow p
1618232123067421,38:06,hirsitus,Put her in the Sun for a few hours
1618232175419868,38:59,Mangalani Mangalani,Bushiri lawyer again
1618232177830919,39:01,Eleanor Woodman,"@Sanjay Maharaj and just before Mckinsey scandal broke green bank quickly employed on of them permanently, top position in Retail"
1618232188364997,39:12,Sanjay Maharaj,Accenture??? what a bunch of yahoos. they were born out of the disgrace Arthur Anderson.... the CEs of these large organizations tagt pay for these consultants must be hanged by their toes.
1618232212946099,39:36,Eleanor Woodman,"@Mangalani Mangalani they all ""helped"" the green bank, even overseas consultants too"
1618232240403657,40:04,Kevin1,"The ""letter of acceptance"" would have been the agreement on which they commenced work"
1618232357676715,42:01,Sanjay Maharaj,"@eleanor, not surprised. they are an incestuous bunch. knew a CE from Absa who married his mother's sister's brother-in-law's niece. his own cousin!!"
1618232363175066,42:06,Mangalani Mangalani,@Sanjay Maharaj Managers are instructed to work with these fraudsters since Executives have accepted kickbacks.
1618232364749708,42:08,Johann Enslin,Yup
1618232393028779,42:36,Sanjay Maharaj,"@mangalani, this is have seen."
1618232421859658,43:05,Eleanor Woodman,"@Sanjay Maharaj @Mangalani Mangalani yes, was a free for all"
1618232577251443,45:41,Kevin1,You are correct DCJ
1618232617780866,46:21,Gugulethu Dube,Seleka has been getting paid for doing almost nothing in the last couple of weeks
1618232621766691,46:25,roza,anoj no matter how many tyms u wrap urself up in a chappie wrapper u still a chappie to be spat out after uve been chewed start speaking the truth plz nd stop confusing everything
1618232626701721,46:30,HeatherDurr,DCJ STOP IT. You have no idea what happened -follow the evidence for God's sake
1618232631199859,46:34,Eleanor Woodman,who is watching judge selection
1618232647168372,46:50,Mangalani Mangalani,Funny that no one talks abt Brian Dames. He got McKinsey into Eskom & left to join McKinsey thereafter.
1618232651301863,46:55,Kevin1,Singh is now playing with semantics - trying to be clever
1618232686165594,47:29,Diane Louw,"he keeps referring to ""her"" when he talks who love to know who he is referring too"
1618232713436944,47:57,ma baker,I agree Heather. I am so frustrated.
1618232740110975,48:23,Rory Lee Farnham,"Anoj, you know you lying, you captured and you burying yourself."
1618232756711157,48:40,Diane Louw,im beyond frustration with this....
1618232763531161,48:47,Sanjay Maharaj,"how did that chair become a ""Mr""? surely with that wide bottom, if should be ""Mrs""?"
1618232786411028,49:10,Jenny Whitewaves,Dr Weiss believed the unsigned SLA was inaction Jan 2018 because there was a acceptance letter in place and work was done on that so back dating it was only dating it to the date it was in action
1618232796621348,49:20,S V 1,I'ts time Chair let's Seleka do his job jirrie he's allowing Singh to run the commission !
1618232819629520,49:43,Jenny Whitewaves,Jan 2016
1618232839918461,50:03,Sanjay Maharaj,"@roza, yiu are nkt allowed to insinuate that Ah-know is a chappie. that would be racist because ""chappie"" was a know it all monkey"
1618232842707385,50:06,ma baker,I am waiting for a question or evidence to nail him.
1618232894748317,50:58,Dee Bee,Chair. ..cool it
1618232916916149,51:20,Diane Louw,Chair is confusing the whole matter.....
1618232935317362,51:39,Sanjay Maharaj,seems to me that Komodo has given up on coconut and his apprehensions of being an evidence leader. about time too
1618232938721039,51:42,Gugulethu Dube,Contracts 101
1618232992638946,52:36,roza,Sanjay hes a chappie nd irritates the heck out of me
1618233007564264,52:51,Diane Louw,Seleka is trying to stop Chair but he is not listening
1618233009832094,52:53,Kevin1,DCJ must let the process follow its course - he has now confused himself
1618233028379542,53:12,roza,sanjay hes cheeky nd shud grow up 2
1618233048133547,53:32,Sanjay Maharaj,Pardo me. it was curious George who was a monkey. chappie was a lion.
1618233068922518,53:52,Kagiso Gabela,What is this? No one is going to get arrested. what's the point.

1618233548024164,1:01:51,Kevin1,His meshing an SLA with and MSA is NOT correct and is smoke and mirrors
1618233549721698,1:01:53,Louis C,we now have a pastor who farts on congregants to bless them
1618233585664852,1:02:29,Diane Louw,lol @Alta we at the stage where the DCJ is confusing...

1618233927520473,1:08:11,Joan De Beer,help me is this about the R6b paid before signing the contract?
1618233933091416,1:08:16,sthembiso phewa,what's seleka getting paid for in today's session? I think he must give a quarter to the chair. he's doing most of his graft
1618233936645271,1:08:20,Louis C,@ALTA Glad nie. ek spring maar so tussen die kommissie en die krieket. kan nie besluit watter is meer vervelig nie

1618239476506426,2:40:40,Waheeda Khan,this is a straightforward case. according to the pfma trillion was not a sub contractor or neither a nominated sub contractor. they got paid directly by singh without a cession by McKenzie.
1618239512060861,2:41:15,Moonchild,@Waheeda Khan - that's how I see it. Why they have to go into all this confusion is insane.
1618239521469048,2:41:25,SanFran Arnold,@Waheeda Khan indeed 100%....thats the long and the short of it
1618239529110660,2:41:32,Lerato Moleke,@Walter Moloto do they (NPA) have the budget. Remember they said no budget for Steinhoff hence the company offered R30M or something along that amount

1618241306413723,3:11:09,HeatherDurr,You can backdate a contract legally as long as it is not fraudulent. You can have verbal contracts i.e at the grocer and they can sue you on a verbal contract
