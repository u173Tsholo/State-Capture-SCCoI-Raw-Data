1567672146276112,27:51,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 The man did not even pass matric. It is contained in the PP report. Where did he get an N6 from?
1567672173735966,28:19,Derek Main,Hlaudi is not right in the head.
1567672227449071,29:13,Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,"hayi stop saying Hlaudi is not right in the head... he is a leader of a political party now, he got two votes. 😂😂😂😂"
1567672274060011,30:00,carnoth ngomane,"@Derek Main you are correct, he was consumed by greed and materialism"
1567672303506453,30:29,Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,he was angry when he got 2 votes. he said 'I voted for Hlaudi and Hlaudi voted for Hlaudi.' 😂😂😂
1567672325309880,30:50,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 But you stated it as a fact. Now support it. Where did he get a N6 from?
1567672335685861,31:00,Derek Main,@Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona 🤣 Sounds about right for Hlaudi.
1567672492140220,33:36,Lorna Kavanagh,The female kidnapper of Amy-Lee was known to parents. This will add to the unemployment of domestics that is for sure. Glad to say kidnapping is a life sentence.
1567672551933745,34:37,Pastor J.J,@Lorna Kavanagh Is it a fact the Domestic was arrested? or involved?
1567672575247698,35:00,Blessed Muya,hi gys

1567672776817146,38:22,Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,"@Derek Main, you know zero about Hlaudi. he's a hero he introduced 90% local content and said now you can only play Elton John and Adele because they are from East London.. 😂😂😂😂"

1567672893338715,40:19,Norman Zwane,"@Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona The 'two' voters who voted for Hlaudi are certainly not right in the head, if Hlaudi himself is right in the head."
1567672924599098,40:50,Lorna Kavanagh,EWN news said a female suspect has been arrested
1567672960876899,41:26,Pastor J.J,@Lorna Kavanagh Could it possibly be the childs Grandmother or Aunt?
1567673150049815,44:36,Norman Zwane,"@Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona How did Hlaudi arrive at 90%, and not 89% or 91% for instance? Sounds like a thumb-sucked number since there aren't to many things you multiply & divide that give you 90%"
1567673273633624,46:39,Pastor J.J,@Lorna Kavanagh Why so???
1567673294291673,46:59,Mpangire Richard,Thats a sign of BACKWARDNESS.
1567673310727493,47:16,Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,"Norman Zwane, Hlaudi doesn't believe in research he probably just came up with 90%. 😂😂😂😂 he's a genius no need for research."
1567673396961850,48:42,Buti Sipho,12h00 EFF presser

1567673616222192,52:20,Cerebis,Not interested in the EFF presser! They are part of the problem in SA.
1567673618291654,52:22,Phillip Pule,fellow south african let us unite and fight those who looted our soes the way we fight immigrants
1567673622176175,52:27,Bonisa Bonani,If Hlaudi came to this commission he would break the internet.
1567673638221530,52:44,Dorothy Milne,"African refugee, we reported JZ here for his mischief"
1567673647414855,52:52,Slindile Ngcobo,"@Jacob Zuma ...darker the chocolate, tastier the chocolate"

1567673762223914,54:48,Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,"Diggo, Hlaudi is comical he deserves a comedy special show."
1567673829134774,55:54,Cerebis,Hopefully the On Point issue will now also be properly investigated as well as the shooting of a firearm at an EFF meeting by the Great Pretender.?
1567673847058219,56:12,Marie Viljoen,"MR ZUMA cut it. nobody wants to hear. see, harm you. nobody wants to know anything about you, of you ever. leave South Africans alone to live a Zuma-free life."
1567673863163575,56:28,Derek Main,@Cerebis Exactly - who needs to watch Malema vomit his racism.
1567673899025378,57:04,Paular S.A,"who ever you are masquerading to be @JacobZuma , you are annoying us."
1567673929990379,57:36,Mpangire Richard,True tell him
1567673931180913,57:37,R.S,just block him
1567673938939475,57:44,Derek Main,@Paular Sated Use the block facility and save yourself some frustration.
1567673954768818,58:00,rwantsana ps,for as long as the government doesnt do anything about immigration of foreign natoinal who are not supposed to be here only the legitimate ones should remain in this country the rest must go

1567674153133760,1:01:18,Mpangire Richard,you like soft life only
1567674153928355,1:01:19,Derek Main,@rwantsana ps I agree - it's an issue that has to be addressed. The Dept of Home Affairs has a lot to answer for.
1567674159361387,1:01:25,makhosi nobhatyi,Motsoaneng was controlled by Zuma and Guptas

1567674465115325,1:06:30,Derek Main,"@Hlamulo Evan Correct! There is no coherent immigration policy or it's not being implemented properly. Like so much else the ANC touches, it has all turned to s**t."
1567674488713770,1:06:54,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 How did your N6 research go? Should we resolve to change it to N0?
1567674560979248,1:08:06,makhosi nobhatyi,"Painting heist, at free state painting was lost 2018 former PA of Ace Magashule said painting may be packed by mistake the day premier pack his things, that painting worth 8 million was put on auctn"

1567674651422215,1:09:37,Mpangire Richard,ok
1567674684816630,1:10:10,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 Nobody asking for it to be stopped - we need some of the skills that immigrants bring. But the uncontrolled movement of foreigners into SA will cause more strife. It's not rocket science.
1567674686610354,1:10:12,G T,"every single person that uses YouTube and Facebook daily are funding peadophiles in government, the Franklin cover up, hamstead school cover up, jeffrey epstein, Harvey weinstein when will it stop"

1567674760818347,1:11:27,Kopz Koape,SA is a gansters paradise
1567674832124261,1:12:38,Moshoeu Mabusela,@Kopz Koape. Let us come out with solutions. talk is cheap and is outdated.
1567674881484745,1:13:27,Shaun 21,it can be stopped once we oust corruption
1567674927656231,1:14:13,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 This must an issue that governments around the world are grappling with. Our government needs to do a better job.
1567674932017520,1:14:17,Shaun 21,they can if they choose to
1567674976214307,1:15:01,Shaun 21,the European union bounds their hands and even despite this italy greece and various other countries are now refusing
1567675006477691,1:15:32,G T,"it's time that people started to show themself as worthy, after all these dirty scumbags are brought down we need to know who to trust after so stand up or go down woth them"
1567675031298185,1:15:57,Shaun 21,and i dont blame them controlled immigration is what is desirable but our problem is pure unadulterated corruption
1567675043858286,1:16:09,Shaun 21,his hands are bound friend
1567675048345030,1:16:14,Shaun 21,wake up!
1567675116262960,1:17:21,Norman Zwane,@Gee Peex1 Ah so there is a way to control it. Our looters were busy taking bribes instead of thinking of a way introduce humane win-win controls. Few foreigners are without access to all SA grants.
1567675142473680,1:17:47,Shaun 21,no our border patrol agents and police take bribes
1567675166413242,1:18:12,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane The grants system seems to be a hot-bed of fraud and corruption.
1567675198669003,1:18:44,Shaun 21,we have problems with Nigerian cartels and all sorts due to this corruption and i have no doubt they are in with government
1567675254781865,1:19:40,Shaun 21,as corruption drips down from the top the only solution is to stop and prosecute corruption at the highest levels
1567675267848943,1:19:52,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 .” A human resources manager at the SABC in 1996 told Motsoeneng that the fact that he did not have a matric certificate would be a serious hindrance to progress in the SABC.
1567675283080425,1:20:09,Shaun 21,and the fear of being corrupt will drip down from the top
1567675319681318,1:20:45,Pastor J.J,"@Gee Peex1 This was after an audit by Deloitte & ­Touche had found his colleagues regarded him as a “semi-literate journalist, inexperienced and not able to communicate in English”."
1567675323332733,1:20:49,Shaun 21,No we can properly enforce our borders and then check peoples credentials when they enter our country
1567675353855199,1:21:19,Norman Zwane,"@Shaun 21 People indeed under-estimate how corruption can morph out of money to Xenophobia, Femicide, Criminality etc. Corruption is like the H.I.V. of governance, once in it collapses all controls"
1567675409119351,1:22:14,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 The point is simple. You made a point that he has a N6 as a fact and cannot support it. Be real bro.
1567675418032153,1:22:23,Shaun 21,agreed thats our goal as people rather then focusing on the symtoms which the government loves we should focus on the source of the problem which is government
1567675420281533,1:22:26,Thulani Bukani,Well said @Norman Zwane
1567675450843367,1:22:56,JS Bach,@Pastor J I read on news24 the female suspect is a teacher at the little girl's school.
1567675462776448,1:23:08,Shaun 21,our government love pointing fingers and detouring discontent
1567675509983303,1:23:55,Pastor J.J,@Lorna Kavanagh Read the post from @JS Bach .Is this a Domestic or Black persons you were referring to?
1567675522680333,1:24:08,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main It is, but it is exceeded by patronage. In our society people are beholden to some individuals who by their position disburse patronage and thus become cult leaders who cannot be deposed."
1567675552775218,1:24:38,Pastor J.J,@JS Bach Thanks for that update. Very sad indeed that we cant trust those that we need to trust
1567675634203628,1:25:59,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 You may consider me to blind but I dont bulls88t people that I am highly intelligent if i am not.Try being honest friend.
1567675667507769,1:26:32,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane That's the same modus operandi of the gangsters here in CT.
1567675752747445,1:27:58,Norman Zwane,"@Pastor J Talking of TRUST, you know I don't even trust me when it comes to women. I do not even know how I can dare ask them to trust me.. I 've never harmed one but I have thoughts that scare me."
1567675814515870,1:29:00,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 @Pastor J I'm with Pastor here - you made a claim and he called you out on it. Now you can't substantiate your claim.
1567675833479655,1:29:18,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 Yes - I am.
1567675924429627,1:30:49,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main In the past, as a student, I use to think a well run welfare state would be able to undermine patronage. In theory I was convinced, but as I grew up I realised how theory never survives."
1567675952785689,1:31:18,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 🤣 Sorry bro. I'm sure it won't be our last run-in but it's nice to hear different viewpoints.
1567676032182135,1:32:37,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane Agreed - which is sad - there are many people in SA living in abject poverty. That grant is their lifeline.
1567676180950361,1:35:06,My View,This woman knows what she's talking about
1567676502603390,1:40:06,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha It does seem odd that they are not paid for their work.
1567676579958777,1:41:23,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 Thought they would have put him in a padded room by now.
1567676623141260,1:42:07,Pastor J.J,@Norman Zwane You are right my brother. Even some Pastors are doubtful these days
1567676702547027,1:43:26,Pastor J.J,@Derek Main . Thank you Derek. You are always straight and honest on all the chats. It irks me when people continuously state innuendos as a fact and cat support it when asked to do so.
1567676743258774,1:44:08,Ambani Muilambudzi,just give 👤 an answer
1567676795090926,1:44:59,Lindy Maweni,.
1567676976475095,1:48:00,Slindile Ngcobo,@Gee Peex1 .....He is a Chairman not a Judge for this particular commission

1567677093302462,1:49:57,mafuta,@Gee Peex1.... lol I have never had the pleasure of meeting Mr Main. I am from KZN.
1567677127877434,1:50:31,Chiss Joe,You can't like her but you can appreciate her performance.
1567677146371006,1:50:50,Danie Nilsen,it seems to me the judge is more strict on keeping with the comissions mandate and not want to listen to a lot of inuendos
1567677186161174,1:51:30,Chiss Joe,"No, no, no this is a commission of inquiry and not a court of law."
1567677248151710,1:52:32,Chiss Joe,Biased? Please substantiate...how is she biased?
1567677253605652,1:52:37,Derek Main,@mafuta Maybe one day. I went to school in PMB YEARS ago.

1567678624526448,2:15:28,Chiss Joe,SABC should serve us not any party. It's a public broadcaster financed by tax payers money.
1567678665644048,2:16:09,funicanz,"@Gee Peex1 , the journalists were reinstated. Including this one testifying now. Let me rather say, he didn't follow protocol, which says alot."
1567678670052384,2:16:15,Diana Sekatane,"The thieves, thugs, fraudsters are creating an ungovernable state so as to further their agenda of making it difficult for our president to root out corruption."
1567678727717217,2:17:11,funicanz,"When listening to this damning testimony, one can dot the i's and cross the t's ."
1567678755018360,2:17:38,Danie Nilsen,i must add that you can not excuse yourself from it though it was pay for work or do not get work ie contracts
1567678765004219,2:17:49,Chiss Joe,Fraud in the private sector is bad but worse of is when the state steals money from it's citizens.
1567678792480475,2:18:16,Kevin Simon,"funicanz ​@Gee Peex1 , the journalists were reinstated. Including this one testifying now. One died as well."
1567678799423658,2:18:24,Danie Nilsen,true
1567678852276081,2:19:15,Kevin Simon,In fact she'd been shot in the face using a pellet gun sometime before she died.
1567678890565416,2:19:54,funicanz,"I get that, I am not singling anyone. Listening to this testimony has me giving out my opinion, none of what is being testified here is not in the public domain. @Concerned South African ,"

1567678972366776,2:21:16,Chiss Joe,"Why take somebody to the three Gupta brothers to be congratulated? Is that normal in a country with UCT, Wits, Rhodes universities."

1567678992554241,2:21:37,funicanz,"we are on the same page. I was merely responding to @Gee Peex1 who wants me provide proof of my statement which I did. Hlaudi was corrupt and he knew he was protected,"

1567679170076043,2:24:33,Chiss Joe,"Guys, is it possible that the three Gupta brothers are running the country from Dubai? Maybe that is why there is a lot of traffic by some known people flying to Dubai."

1567679344329112,2:27:27,Born free,Guptas only became wealthy when they captured Zuma and the ANC
1567679366183343,2:27:49,Danie Nilsen,i a can understand poor unemployed stealing to food on the table what i do not get is goverment who is not poor and have employement steal from the poor

1567679439260484,2:29:02,Pastor J.J,@Thando Nkutha You are and will always be the first man I loved despite being married to my wife for 40years.
1567679481985421,2:29:45,Chiss Joe,But Zuma was president of South Africa how could it be that we were auctioned off. So the Gupta brothers paid off the corrupt guys from our own money...now that is hilarious.
1567679491617068,2:29:55,Born free,I am confused
1567679495611548,2:29:59,Pastor J.J,@Thando Nkutha You are a fine and honest man with a lot of integrity. I do respect you a lot my brother
1567679580900957,2:31:24,Kevin Simon,Not condoning xenophobia but makes one wonder whether or not the foreigners are seeking a better like in RSA than what they have in their own home countries. Speaks volumes.
1567679600546849,2:31:44,Heaven is real,@Chiss Joe. School counts.
1567679601146258,2:31:45,Danie Nilsen,let the love flow thats all that we need let the love flow
1567679625333068,2:32:09,Chiss Joe,I'm also confused how a person can break into your house and than start feeding you from your own pots and you start worshipping the thief.
1567679626816406,2:32:10,funicanz,"@Thando Nkutha , @Pastor J @Born free you have lost me completely. I am confused with where your comments and/or conversation has gone to..."

1567679674404560,2:32:57,Pastor J.J,@funicanz We are sharing love in a sad and cruel world. You are also loved
1567679695776332,2:33:19,Chiss Joe,"One day, we will be free."
1567679720390412,2:33:44,Born free,Guptas and Watson amongst others captured Zuma and as a result the State was captured in turn by these people and Zumas ANC faction.
1567679746592144,2:34:10,Antonie Goosen,SA needs to free itself from the ANC in order to really be free
1567679793699921,2:34:57,Heaven is real,@Chiss Joe..that's so true
1567679807921974,2:35:11,Danie Nilsen,so much in that one sentance and yet so easy to follow i will not do any bad unto others that i do not wish upon myself

1567679879928250,2:36:23,Born free,Gee Peex ..I hope you are being sarcastic.
1567679912180923,2:36:56,Pastor J.J,@Thando Nkutha I will and likewise my Precious friend
1567679916604390,2:37:00,Chiss Joe,"Look at Thabo Mbeki, the man left government with his hands in the pockets. Nothing to show his brother or mother that he was a president. Isn't that how a states man should be?"
1567679922152441,2:37:06,Antonie Goosen,Hope that you are?? Where have you been hiding the past 20 odd years ?
1567679980597612,2:38:04,Huntley Cronje,"@Moshoeu Mabusela - finished my little bit of leftovers from last night, what was left after the kids ate and took some for school - did not see the gravy train, apparently some delays"
1567680002058879,2:38:25,Born free,Mbeki was no saint. The money is offshore.
1567680049675700,2:39:13,Huntley Cronje,If you cannot put away money for retirement on a President's Salary - then you ought not to be there in the first place.
1567680078923776,2:39:42,Chiss Joe,"Did people join the struggle to come and steal? I don't know, maybe you guys know better."
1567680124787929,2:40:28,Antonie Goosen,Only Struggle is to hide the corruption haha
1567680137503633,2:40:41,Derek Main,@Huntley Cronje We suckers that are taxpayers pay for ex-presidents and their families for the rest of their lives.
1567680174131572,2:41:17,Antonie Goosen,"Derek - you also paying for the Watsons, etc"
1567680191740453,2:41:35,Heaven is real,"@Born free...get it back. If you can't, you are lying why should we believe you."
1567680205600939,2:41:49,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 Zuma definitely perfected corruption on a grand scale.
1567680228870710,2:42:13,Chiss Joe,How could he have been a giant? That is a peddled narrative. Have you any literature about him being a giant?
1567680243882716,2:42:26,Shaun 21,during the struggle zuma ran a detention camp for unruly members of the struggle
1567680260034449,2:42:44,Shaun 21,where some questionable things happened to say the least
1567680262605439,2:42:46,Chiss Joe,Forced to resign so that they could loot.
1567680284031385,2:43:08,Derek Main,@Antonie Goosen Of course - I am paying for all the cadres feeding at the trough.
1567680305347447,2:43:28,Nherera Karls,I hope we are not going to witness another accident
1567680346685263,2:44:08,Derek Main,"@Gee Peex1 You'd have to be blind, deaf, dumb and mute not to see that Zuma is corruption personified."
1567680356840957,2:44:19,Heaven is real,@Chiss Joe..exactly
1567680432719329,2:45:29,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 Just because she didn't find evidence in one particular case that she investigated doesn't mean he's innocent. His time is coming.
1567680617220971,2:46:45,Chiss Joe,Qunu? even my grandmothers house she build from the money she saved from selling umqhoboti is better.
1567680617447223,2:46:46,Heaven is real,Mandela used his own money to build Qunu.
1567680700951012,2:46:55,Shaun 21,anyone of us caught doing such a thing would be in prison
1567680756475117,2:47:08,Jimmi Alli,Why was Zuma allowed to have all those wives and kids on the payroll
1567681172116633,2:48:40,Heaven is real,ZUMA IS NOT A VICTIM of anything. He's just a corrupt leader.
1567681199094432,2:49:31,Chiss Joe,"I miss the real ANC of Mandela, Oliver, Mbeki."
1567681203108868,2:49:38,Huntley Cronje,"@Gee Peex1 - what, the gravy train late on your side also?"
1567681226426817,2:49:56,Chiss Joe,Rich country poor leadership
1567681392655232,2:50:33,Chiss Joe,"Isn't South Africa richer than the Emirates In terms of minerals, nature, etc? If so why are we calling ourselves third world?"
1567681449554297,2:50:41,Derek Main,"@Diss & Dad Like I say, you're out of touch. The ANC is corrupt from top to bottom and back. National, provincial, local govt, municipalities have all been corrupted by the ANC."
1567681555969084,2:50:43,Pastor J.J,@Danie Nilsen The thingy was with Dali Mpofu. Zuma was behind the killing of Chris Hani and the ANC knows that
1567681882003772,2:52:54,David Foster,it was not declared a crime against humanity
1567681913525798,2:53:23,Eugene,awe ouens
1567681939798530,2:53:57,David Foster,"no it wasn't. what i heard was it was going to be declared, but it never was."
