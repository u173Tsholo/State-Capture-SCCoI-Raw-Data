1605184370892780,32:43,Mzalwane Mzala,ANC won 72.9% according to my calculations but the party claims 73.6% I could be missing something.
1605184378970701,32:51,Yolo More,He is protecting the Guptas
1605184383420209,32:56,kevindbn007,@Vusimuzi Nkosi clearly the anc has kept the truth from the masses
1605184392722477,33:07,kevindbn007,to keep them opressed

1605184439312421,33:51,Lee D. Hendrix,....Government cannot function or exist as a business. The wealthiest or brightest prescribes pre adventures..
1605184446546090,33:58,Barnie Huysamer,Watching the President answering questions in Parliament. I think he is part of the problem..... giving vague answers to pertinent questions.
1605184468518167,34:20,TheQueen V,now that should just pack up their circus and move to lagos
1605184488365083,34:40,Pastor J.J,@Russia Magezi But they are a S African Party. 0 here?

1605184746297602,38:59,David Tuer,Teunis van Ree I think you're right. I suspect he was so upset by what he saw as his treatment by Denel that he lost his sense of perspective and was easy meat for the Guptas.

1605187535502652,1:25:28,MIKE DURBAN,The ACE hit a ......miss ball...........
1605187545517056,1:25:38,Tickle McVetkoek,"Gerrie Nel is reporting that after his discussion with Helen Zille, the poor results emerged due to a lack of effecting networking between their offices"
1605187554070115,1:25:47,fuzile dazana,HEBAANA
1605187610466005,1:26:43,Tickle McVetkoek,"In addition, John Steenhuizen reported the FF held back critical funding they promised him early in the month."
1605187613819323,1:26:46,Mzalwane Mzala,The fact that the EFF did not win a ward should not a shock to an ardent observer of South African politics. The EFF have consistently grown its footprint without winning wards since its formation.
1605187650391475,1:27:22,Smart Guys,eff will fall
1605187657052183,1:27:29,Tickle McVetkoek,"We may deduce the FF, Afriforum-Gerrie-Nel and DA alliance was not very effective."
1605187665606718,1:27:38,Tickle McVetkoek,😃
1605187697376791,1:28:09,Freddie Van Rhyn,All EFF knows how to do is to disrupt and vandalize.
1605187715653386,1:28:29,ALTA,adv Kennedy yes yes
1605187743623784,1:28:56,Tickle McVetkoek,Square Back what is he issue with you and Carl Niehause? 😄😄😄😄😄
1605187744431173,1:28:57,Dominic Przybylski,@Smart Guys EFF can't fall very far if they can only crawl. They're just a bunch of crooks pretending to be 'freedom fighters'.
1605187747941879,1:29:00,ALTA,witness stutter to much
1605187750261453,1:29:02,Lee D. Hendrix,"And Adam(male and female) was continuously in paradise, on Earth, and the devil understood that I wanted to create another world, because Adam was lord on earth, to rule and control it."
1605187758841005,1:29:11,Diana Sekatane,Incremenating issues witnesses seems to have forgotten crucial information. this is highly suspicious.

1605187773180523,1:29:26,Mzalwane Mzala,Almost all EFF councilors come from the Party Representative (PR) list. I can only think of about 2 wards in the NW that the EFF won and nothing more but it still grows.
1605187804997543,1:29:58,ALTA,@Pastor J.J 😂😂
