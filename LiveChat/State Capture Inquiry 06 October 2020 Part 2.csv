1601995891900659,2:32:34,Handsome Boy,@ Simmy Ndlovu girls who wear weaves avoid getting into a fight because they know they will have it pulled out and get their balding head exposed.

1601996201554444,2:37:44,Handsome Boy,@ Simmy Ndlovu okay but the point is you aren't confident enough to show your real hair.
1601996207626690,2:37:50,Simmy Ndlovu,"mduduzi,his crazy..handsome my foot"
1601996225531332,2:38:07,Cerebis,I never trusted Agrizzi. He came to the Commission as a known crook. He has a deal with the Commission I think.?
1601996234692912,2:38:16,Simmy Ndlovu,"hair,handsome is in between your legs"

1601996259132515,2:38:41,R.m. B.,The Zuma clique are going to run out of hit-men at this rate 🤫
1601996303828699,2:39:27,Simmy Ndlovu,"mduduzi,he is trying to sell himself..no buyers kwaaaas"
1601996308948529,2:39:32,Handsome Boy,@ Simmy Ndlovu hmm chances are you are one those females with hair on their chest.
1601996315804447,2:39:38,Russia Magezi,"Banele, Agrizzi didn't lie at all. In fact he deserves a state funeral BUT he must equally serve his jail term first."
1601996328441141,2:39:51,Simmy Ndlovu,handsome..yes definitely
1601996330074207,2:39:52,Kopz Koape,imagine if Zondo is on Zumas payroll..I would not be surprised
1601996335274724,2:39:57,Carmen James,@Handsome Boy . Nothing rehearsed her. She wanted to follow due processes
1601996348892902,2:40:11,Gift Mazibuko,Eskom''s illegal suspension of these executives is very similar to the that of the SABC 8. Proof that state capture was a well planned systematic madness.
1601996374318927,2:40:36,SanFran Arnold,@Gift Mazibuko thats true.
1601996386719653,2:40:49,Handsome Boy,@ Carmen James who is going to cross examine her?
1601996407568965,2:41:10,L. M,@Handsome Boy stop annoying Simmy and us here and Simmy dont entertain him

1601996437473546,2:41:40,Gift Mazibuko,It is no wonder why Zuma is up to his old tricks trying to evade the commission.
1601996441010685,2:41:43,tshika tshabeng,The insults aren't really necessary adults!
1601996450273461,2:41:52,Kopz Koape,@Simmy..Wig or weave..You mean weave????
1601996452024604,2:41:54,Sthakathi Khumalo,Ehhhe chair as CFO what were the issues in drafting the finance plan... what were her difficulties

1601996458599097,2:42:01,Simmy Ndlovu,"LM,this boy the whole day telling us about his handsome..Suka!"
1601996459985380,2:42:03,Banele Masuku,@Russia Magezi True. He told the truth alright but he was a crook. My point is she might be telling the truth but we don't know the whole story yet
1601996478353728,2:42:20,Carmen James,@Handsome Boy . I have no further words for you.
1601996479290165,2:42:21,Simmy Ndlovu,"Kopz,both"
1601996486680767,2:42:29,Handsome Boy,@ Simmy Ndlovu I know underneath that weave is Zondo's bald head.
1601996491075988,2:42:33,Sammy Tlhapi,I like Ntate Zondo line of questioning you can just hear hes a legal mind legend👌
1601996514108798,2:42:56,Russia Magezi,"I agree with you Banele, 100%"

1601996575574029,2:43:57,Gift Mazibuko,"@sammy tlhapi, true, only Zuma does not share that sentiment..🤣"
1601996595760543,2:44:17,Kopz Koape,@Simmy..You shouldn't admit that you need a weave..You should be decieving us with your hair that is a sistas golden rule
1601996606333760,2:44:28,Eddie Reddy,"she is the best witness so far,she sings logically and she's worth her qualification. she didn't ask for help, Matchila and essa were pushing themselves bastards"

1601996625054661,2:44:47,Simmy Ndlovu,"Kopz,I'm making him stupid"
1601996637547779,2:45:01,Handsome Boy,@ Simmy Ndlovu sure thing and a little bird told me that you vacuum your weave.
1601996644170437,2:45:06,Nemabubuni Geoffrey,women are storytellers

1601996778426831,2:47:21,Handsome Boy,@ Yolo More yeah and @ Simmy Ndlovu is intimidated by my sexy looks. She definitely has a sour relationship with mirrors because she isn't impressed by what they reflect when she looks into them.

1601996904261769,2:49:27,Homo Naledi,Sounds like Me. Tsotsi was living up to his name at Eskom.
1601996905338375,2:49:28,SanFran Arnold,"@Handsome Boy thats enough now, please stop with the personal attacks. Its just childish. We actually trying to watch the commission and comment on it."

1601996933508067,2:49:56,R.m. B.,"@Eddie Reddy - why does everything have to be allegedly racist. If she was European, I would ask what country...."
1601996937488273,2:50:00,Pastor J.J,@Simmy Ndlovu You are giving airtime to an oxygen thief. Ignore him my Sister

1601996984012022,2:50:46,Carmen James,@Derek Govender . I don't agree. This is precisely why she was suspended. She refused to co-operate with Eric Wood et al
1601996995173893,2:50:57,SanFran Arnold,@Handsome Boy that would be appreciated
1601997018883311,2:51:21,Handsome Boy,@Yolo More thanks son.
1601997043047853,2:51:45,Cerebis,@Handsome Boy You are getting abusive Honey. You need to stop now or I will report you for abusive action. You are plain stupid it would seem to me.
1601997061340199,2:52:04,Kopz Koape,it seems the only country in the SADC region which is not corrupt is Botswana..The government has been considered squeaky clean
1601997061625397,2:52:04,Handsome Boy,@Pastor J. J always poking his unwanted nose where it doesn't belong.
1601997082307963,2:52:26,Naledi Barron,"@Thendo Luruli My heart weeps. There were so many of us who didn't care about colour/religion/tribe/anything. I had to solutions, but nobody would listen, because I was a whitey."

1601997157075541,2:53:40,Carmen James,Carry on listening @Derek Govender . She is going to join the dots for us!!!!!
1601997166586506,2:53:50,Nemabubuni Geoffrey,it seems Mr Tsotsi compromised himself to be used as corruption doormat at Eskom
1601997171108529,2:53:54,Eddie Reddy,She is now CEO of Transnet
1601997190676481,2:54:13,Handsome Boy,@Cerebis I think I was fair when speaking ill against those who wear weaves but @Simmy Ndlovu started involving my mother and grandmother and none of you biased scumbags are saying anything about that
1601997209667866,2:54:32,Sfiso Mnguni,@Eddie Reddy no shes not
1601997215351451,2:54:38,Sihle Ngcobo,She is Telkom's CFO
1601997219961197,2:54:42,Carmen James,"No, @Eddie Reddy . The CEO of Transnet is Brian Molefe's ex wife......not this lady"
1601997222260063,2:54:44,Cerebis,@Kopz Koape Agree with you. Namibia is also not corrupt.
1601997227143857,2:54:49,Xolani J Masemula,"@Eddie, she is now CEO of Transnet? oof that suddenly makes her very suspicious,"
1601997234467302,2:54:57,Naledi Barron,"@Thendo Luruli The ultimate honour I was given was being called a ""Cadbury Top Deck"". White on the outside, Black on the inside. And I still and will always love my coconuts!"

1601997255897403,2:55:18,R.m. B.,Revenge time....
1601997264659257,2:55:27,Handsome Boy,@ SanFran and what do you have to say about @ Simmy Ndlovu insulting my mother and grandmother ? Biased much?
1601997276183041,2:55:38,Eddie Reddy,@Carmen isn't Brian s ex
1601997287145770,2:55:49,Kopz Koape,@Cerebis it seems both Botswana and Namibia are stable countries unlike SA
1601997323124156,2:56:26,Carmen James,"She is not Brian's ex wife, @Eddie Reddy"
1601997334740637,2:56:37,Bonang Sithole,"actually these women and Brian are great administrators, except that Brian could not handle the Political Presure"
1601997338014383,2:56:40,SanFran Arnold,"@Handsome Boy I am not biased, your comments led to that and that is why I asked you to stop. Aggravating much?"
1601997352406743,2:56:54,Kopz Koape,@Cerebis also.. Botswana has a low crime rate..Its so relaxed there
1601997352754784,2:56:55,Eddie Reddy,Thanks Carmen
1601997360531640,2:57:04,Thulani Faku,This show why we have so much social ills on the ground level. These people are thieves mara.
1601997361988754,2:57:06,Carmen James,"Brian's ex wife is Portia Derby, CEO of Transnet @Eddie Reddy"
1601997378542123,2:57:21,Gift Mazibuko,She is very articulate and composed. I like her..
1601997378906319,2:57:21,Cerebis,"@Kopz Koape Jip. They are currently both ad hearing to their constitutions and are stable, safe countries."

1601997414476649,2:57:56,Yolo More,"@Carmen James, true"
1601997417780614,2:58:01,Banele Masuku,@Bonang Sithole Political Pressure??? He IS CORRUPT
1601997420951679,2:58:04,Pheladi Lamola,I like that she stood her ground despite the pressure from Matjila et al.
1601997431346953,2:58:15,Andre Gerber,@Handsome Boy g sit somewhere in a corner and play with yourself
1601997465412020,2:58:47,Carmen James,She is strong @Pheladi Lamola . She resisted Matjila and Tsotsi!
1601997496847958,2:59:19,Cerebis,I blocked the Boy and his fake Pastor. Peaceful on my chat site.
1601997503828434,2:59:26,Banele Masuku,Slightly off topic: Is it true that the commission can't prosecute or convict anyone?
1601997517083981,2:59:39,Handsome Boy,@SanFran Anorld you are biased because you didn't tell that weave wearing lady to stop with the personal attacks dammit. Who was more personal between her and I?i never said anything about her mom.
1601997517693420,2:59:40,Phillip Van Rensburg,yeah its true
1601997551172554,3:00:14,SanFran Arnold,"@Banele Masuku thats true, this is just inquisitorial"
1601997560620621,3:00:23,Thulani Faku,toothless dogs of the law
1601997561409451,3:00:24,Naledi Barron,"Sheezuz!! McKinsey (""Management Consultants"") were nothing more than blatant thieves!!!"
1601997565991713,3:00:30,Kopz Koape,@Cerebis..I heard its difficult to get a citizenship in Botswana..Im thinking of relocating there
1601997575463999,3:00:37,Cerebis,@Kopz Koape I know people who started doing business in Botswana. The Government does a lot to assist new business ventures.
1601997591356585,3:00:54,Carmen James,My understanding is that NPA can prosecute based on evidence presented at this Commission @Phillip Van Rensburg
1601997627548777,3:01:30,Julian Rehbock,"There is a coalition between the two, yes."
1601997630616408,3:01:33,SanFran Arnold,@Banele Masuku but the president gave the NPA the authority to use what comes out of the commission to prosecute.
1601997637443492,3:01:41,R.m. B.,"@Banele Masuku - as far as I understand, there is a relatively new co-operative deal between the Commission and the NPA and SAP, which effectively gives ZC more power."
1601997657197096,3:02:00,Xolani J Masemula,"Yah, anything presented here I believe can be used as evidence in a trial,"
1601997662452323,3:02:05,Banele Masuku,@SanFran Arnold So we're basically watching a gossip show
1601997662986111,3:02:05,Handsome Boy,@Andre Gerber oh you also wear a weave ..

1601997700260950,3:02:43,SanFran Arnold,@Banele Masuku we are watching the evidence in order to make sure that the NPA prosecute
1601997755383733,3:03:37,Naledi Barron,"@Banele Masuku No, you're watching the fertilisation of state capture"

1601997758718688,3:03:41,Nemabubuni Geoffrey,the commission is putting pressure to the NPA...
1601997770555975,3:03:52,SanFran Arnold,@Handsome Boy I saw the comments you made towards a woman and I did not like it. It ended there for me.

1601997806524315,3:04:28,Cerebis,@Kopz Koape There is no problem to get Permanent residence in Botswana. The problem it would appear to be between a certain ANC minister's wife and elements in Botswana.
1601997815990002,3:04:37,Handsome Boy,@SanFran Anorld and you liked the comments she made about my mother and grandma huh?

1601998207761827,3:11:10,Cerebis,"@Kopz Koape Jip. Housing is very expensive. Cost of living versus SA is High, but they will be earning Ussie Dollars, so it is relative I guess."
1601998213596329,3:11:15,Nemabubuni Geoffrey,@Carmen... I can not Mastermind this level of thinking. way too clever
1601998213760451,3:11:15,Naledi Barron,"@Thulani Faku I hear you, but it is working for now. But I agree, S.A needs a solid and more modern legal Framework that references the previous framework, as well as legal precfedents/lessons learnt"

1601998256362139,3:11:59,Pheladi Lamola,You would think so @Carmen James but the ruling party will just deploy their comrades to the position as important as the finance minister
1601998291429794,3:12:34,Carmen James,So sad @Pheladi Lamola .....
1601998343214699,3:13:26,Thobani Mkananda,"@Handsome Boy Please desist sharing those sentiments about how sexy you might be. This is not the platform. If you continue, you'll only have @Yolo More to stomach your contributions while blocked"
