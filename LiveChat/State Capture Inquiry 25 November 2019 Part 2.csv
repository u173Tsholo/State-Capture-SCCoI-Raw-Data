1574690466714162,1:53:47,fred zulu,why don't we do an audit on the Zuma family before him becoming president and after
1574690541779107,1:55:03,Elvis Malakoane,cwele
1574690550642646,1:55:11,Sthakathi Khumalo,"GUPTAS maintained dominance since Mandela times, but they epitomised their influence when they teamed up with Duduzane. But right now, who is calling the shots with the current CR17 GOVERNMENT?"
1574690672647309,1:57:13,Pheladi Lamola,Cwele is going to have to come here and state his case. He's such a boring character but one will just have to grin and bear it through his testimony.
1574690686177379,1:57:27,Elvis Malakoane,sthakathi khumalo so you are actually saying under Mandela they did not steal but under Zuma they got freeway to the purse
1574690717929905,1:57:59,makhosi nobhatyi,@Sthakathi Khumalo please don‚Äôt lied these guys was nothing even to mr Mbeki only gained power by co operating system to enrich themselves and Zuma family by using Duduzane
1574690735950378,1:58:16,Pastor J.J,@Elvis Malakoane Thats exactly what he said. hehehehehe
1574690750507217,1:58:30,Sthakathi Khumalo,"They probably stole, but the grand theft was intensified when they worked with Zuma!!"
1574690770831149,1:58:51,Pastor J.J,@makhosi nobhatyi 1000% correct
1574690825417649,1:59:46,Sthakathi Khumalo,"makhosi nobhatyi OHO keep lying to yourself GUPTAS had influence during Mandela & Mbekis time, won't even mention Kgalemas stake.."
1574690868096836,2:00:29,Pastor J.J,"@Sthakathi Khumalo ...You use the word ""probably"" and ""alledgedly"" so often that I am now convinced, respectfully, that you do not and never had any ""facts"""
1574690890598947,2:00:50,Sthakathi Khumalo,Pastor J Give me your facts
1574690900603028,2:01:01,enneth khumalo,@Sthakathi Khumalo What did the guptas do during mandela and mbet
1574690926846883,2:01:27,#dm70,"The issues about Zuma are history, point is the economy is crumbling and that's where the focus should be. This commission of inquiry is a waste of time and money, that could be used constructively."
1574690940248842,2:01:41,Elvis Malakoane,agree with us
1574690946965621,2:01:48,Pastor J.J,@Sthakathi Khumalo That cant be a get out free card.
1574690954271576,2:01:54,makhosi nobhatyi,"@redriger @ Pastor J this is clear, Zuma was thinking that to have these cluster with him he will escape, hiding behind laws, it is an insult to us poor, using us to cover his shenanigans woke up ppl"
1574690971899345,2:02:13,enneth khumalo,@Sthakathi Khumalo what did the guptas do during mandela and mbeki's tenure?
1574691035481003,2:03:16,Sthakathi Khumalo,Guptas were friends of Thabo Mbeki; they donated to many to many organised events; had many business partners. The moment they were seen with Jacob Zuma - they were corrupt.
1574691051571883,2:03:32,#dm70,The commission is toothless and noone will go to jail and so what's the point. Only the poor do jail time.
1574691054578153,2:03:35,Elvis Malakoane,sthakathi khumalo you must not block your eyes to the truth because you end up believing yourself sir
1574691106509876,2:04:27,Albert Noah,@enneth khumalo. There is untested information that the Gupta brothers started their business during Mbeki era.
1574691120856734,2:04:41,enneth khumalo,@Sthakathi Khumalo so they only become corrupt once the met Zuma
1574691148607081,2:05:09,nhlanhla nkosi,sthakathi is just the devils advocate here. arguing just for the sake of it
1574691148685150,2:05:09,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ dm70 you cannot just focus on economy without finding what went wrong otherwise every president will do as he or she pleases no one will asked, this is for the protection of the state"
1574691157846285,2:05:18,Sthakathi Khumalo,Look comrades the GUPTAS BECOME THE PROBELM AS SOON AS THEY WORK WITH ZUMA
1574691264543286,2:07:05,Elvis Malakoane,I don't know how can people not see that Zuma presidency destroyed black middle class
1574691282110947,2:07:23,#dm70,"Albert its a fact the Guptas have been around even in Mandela's time. People are only focusing on Zuma, for whatever reason."
1574691318609855,2:07:59,funicanz,chair and intervals
1574691319033698,2:07:59,makhosi nobhatyi,@ridriger arm‚Äôs deal remember he still has share there
1574691372173707,2:08:53,nhlanhla nkosi,Dm70 what does that have to do with the past 2 terms Zuma was in charge
1574691378266927,2:08:59,James Godloza Godloza,@Elvis my problem exactly the Zuma protectors do not love their own country i really find it difficult to understand
1574691424552901,2:09:45,Albert Noah,@funicanz . The intervals are OK but I also think they should help the evidence leader by arranging a seat for the evidence leader.
1574691464335605,2:10:25,#dm70,"Nhlanhla, point is, the investigation should include every person who dealt with the Guptas"
1574691505174863,2:11:06,nhlanhla nkosi,dm 70 did Mandela bankrupt SAA did Mbeki take money from eskom or denels
1574691536230026,2:11:37,#dm70,"James, I don't agree with you. Where's your proof"
1574691570938456,2:12:11,nhlanhla nkosi,Dm70 why waste time investigatin Mandela and mbeki for what Zuma allowed to happen
1574691574647342,2:12:15,makhosi nobhatyi,Remember the book called ‚Äú The gate keepers ‚Äú it exactly what Khumalo did. No stone will remain unturned @ ridriger
1574691601195820,2:12:42,#dm70,"Zuma took no money from any parastals, people have been looting using his name, period"
1574691668867640,2:13:49,Elvis Malakoane,so you are saying Zuma was so useless people used his name to collapse the country with his son
1574691753553873,2:15:14,Pastor J.J,@#dm70.....hahahahahahaha.hehehehehe. stop being follish
1574691759913191,2:15:20,Elvis Malakoane,really guys who defend Zuma you are damaging him than helping him with your inuendos
1574691768139795,2:15:29,Albert Noah,@Abel Matshidiso. Resuming at 1625Hours

1574692238323135,2:23:19,Pastor J.J,ZOBO?
1574692246188883,2:23:27,bongile sango,now he's like he is in other country because of his watch
1574692248817026,2:23:29,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Y'all are referencing untested BOOKS what one may call propaganda, they must come here and give evidence and then we speak!!"
1574692427149943,2:26:28,Pastor J.J,@Sthakathi Khumalo ...Do you believe that Zuma should be prosecuted or not??? we will talk about CR17 separately
1574692455632751,2:26:56,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Thats a petty argument, if the authors have evidence let them present it here, it must be tested at the Zondo commission!"
1574692507615155,2:27:48,Sthakathi Khumalo,Pastor J Everyone involved in wrong doing must be given a chance to state their case and be examined. Whether its Zuma or CR17 or myself..
1574692579701460,2:29:00,Pastor J.J,"So what is the problem with evidence being presented on him,Ace and others including the PP report on CR17????@Sthakathi Khumalo"
1574692656285344,2:30:17,Sthakathi Khumalo,Pastor J The problem is you are not listening... I was making commentary on the books which are deemed as facts here but the veracity of their claims have not been volunteered to the commission!
1574692712918118,2:31:14,Pastor J.J,My questions are based on your comments before the book issue even started.@Sthakathi Khumalo
1574692717976170,2:31:18,Sthakathi Khumalo,redriger How do you know that
1574692734096599,2:31:35,Sthakathi Khumalo,State capture started with Zuma?
1574692825787721,2:33:06,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Pastor J I have mentioned that fairness should be maintained, its cant be that one person is chased left & right for collapsing SA yet you had deputies, whom are now presidents what are they doing?"
1574692828511255,2:33:09,Isaac Mkhatshwa,"The reason why we can't get rid of corruption or get politicians to account are people who justify the unjustifiable,people like this gentleman,shame on you"
1574692837734042,2:33:18,Pastor J.J,@Sthakathi Khumalo ....You are unique and rare. The only one who does not know about the Gupta/Zuma corrupt relationship and how the other fools got drawn in like donkeys and goats. be real
1574692890350806,2:34:11,Pastor J.J,@Sthakathi Khumalo ...Inquiries and investigations is a process. one at a time. be patient
1574692900779244,2:34:21,Pheladi Lamola,Zuma was just president by proxy
1574692965987994,2:35:26,Isaac Mkhatshwa,"He is not unique but blind supporter,maybe he is one of them"
1574693009257724,2:36:10,Albert Noah,@ Sthakathi Khumalo. Actually CR feared being fired from the ANC by the president. The main problem is giving too much powers to the Office of Presidency
1574693014692382,2:36:15,bongile sango,I think not so long ago DCJ advised us not to be in a hurry for conclusion of this commission
1574693018843312,2:36:19,Pheladi Lamola,He should be charged with treason.
1574693279778462,2:40:40,Pheladi Lamola,A whole president prevented an investigation into the Guptas
1574693340317467,2:41:41,roza,hello

1574694218044499,2:56:18,Vish Govender,The concern here is that these guys knew something that was a threat to the state and didn't take it any further. Or is it their hands were tied because they could not challenge the President
1574694234357302,2:56:35,Sthakathi Khumalo,Rasheed Ally Selective treatment in the country is at play here. Today we heard someone will be cross examined based on terms and conditions imagine!
