1599741523491647,31:08,NOXOLO GUMEDE,Shoo this woman is extremely long winded! Not sure of her guilt or innocence.... But to me such behaviour constitutes a lot of shadiness.
1599741542684372,31:26,Supreme Monokeng,"Melor Hadabe, trust me he is one to have in your corner, remember Berry Roux, everybody thought Gary nel will win but...., it's about facts and how u hook in ur victim"

1599741796761543,35:42,Supreme Monokeng,"mangalani he didn't win, the system eventually gave in to public pressure after an APPEAL, he was loud but the transcript only show who had stronger points"
1599741841855316,36:26,Swartbooi Home,@Nxolo Gumede my feeling exactly
1599741851064341,36:36,Mangalani Mangalani,@Supreme Monokeng Who decides on stronger points? Your opinion or courts?
1599742000797713,39:05,Zolile Dola,Mr Makhosi.so you mean Mr Tsotsi he is innocent he never get share on the money have been stolen with these Crooks? he just helped them to do what ever they wanted to do.
1599742017318629,39:22,Ghost Mapetla,"What transpired did happen on its own, it was well calculated and backed with power and this shows clear the someone with real power was driving"
1599742097317625,40:44,Mangalani Mangalani,@Melor Hadebe Thank you for clearing for him. Poor Judge Masepa was not aware of Dolos Entualis principle of law. I was embarrassed by her understanding.
1599742165255238,41:50,Supreme Monokeng,"Hadebe there wasn't an error, Oscar never denied shooting her, the problem was the motive, why he did it, state said that they had a fight, what was the evidence to support this version?"

1599742265838461,43:30,Antoinette Meyer,it stil cant
1599742268262423,43:32,Supreme Monokeng,"she was aware, he she found him guilty of culpable homicide, the challenge was both the verdict (we wanted it to be murder) and the sentence, which was not helped by a weak case, hence he got few year"
1599742276582484,43:40,Antoinette Meyer,even more than then
1599742320683320,44:26,Lauren Maphanga,Eish this lady is lying.

1599742456796973,46:43,Dinno Dash,"when Zondo says "" yes yes yes "" is like those old Anties wanting you to tell them more kkk"
1599742458339204,46:44,JONASNOBROTHER,"@Mangalani not withstanding judge Masepas possible misinterpretation of dolus eventualis, i still felt the state failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the aspect of "" premeditated"" murder"
1599742486280669,47:10,S V 1,with this auntie on the board no wonder Eskom is in this state !!
1599742488957938,47:13,Danile Ngubenyathi,what was her position at Eskom
1599742495352134,47:20,Supreme Monokeng,"mangelani, it's few cause he only has to serve 30% of the sentence."

1599742622946886,49:25,Supreme Monokeng,"hiding doesn't prove its premeditated, he argued that she locked herself up cause she was scared thinking Oscar was referring to an intrude and not her, they needed to prove that, not just say"
1599742626032663,49:30,Vanessa Van Vuuren,Mangalani thanks for finally getting the spelling right
1599742641973818,49:46,jwarha21,auntie must answer for herself

1599742831273526,52:56,Mangalani Mangalani,@Supreme You don’t seem to understand how our legal system & sentencing work. SCA correctly indicated that Judge Masepa got it WRONG! Now you want to use some logic. We only have one legal system

1599742895059985,54:00,JONASNOBROTHER,@Mangalani they're definitely 2 very different concepts. let me rephrase for u. Even if we accept there was incorrect application of dolus eventualis by the judge
1599742909125577,54:13,Mike Newlands,Business Tech says we shall be a failed state by 2030 along with Zim - if these are the idiots we employ in SOE's I doubt we will have to wait that long
1599742911003194,54:14,Michael Michael,can innocent employee suspended for doing gd job.only at Eskom.
1599742925416954,54:29,Elisah Livhuwani,how can you ask them why they should not be suspended where's you fully know that they did nothing wrong ...mara the guptas cronies

1599746635871331,1:56:18,Ghost Mapetla,This are the soldiers we must die before we get Zuma and the Guptas
1599746650575234,1:56:35,Douglas Masuku,Alan spot on. It takes a year to BEGIN to understand a complex entity like Eskom
1599746676481777,1:57:00,Sonwabo Mbimbi,"I don't remember. I'm fraide, I don't remember and that the bottom line"

1599746877808334,2:00:22,NOXOLO GUMEDE,@PeterDolan totally agree with you. Zondo is extremely smart. Why did Eskon board settle on a year's salary on employees who weren't found guilty?
1599746882862096,2:00:27,John Petersen,yes she got her cut from the Gupta family
1599746903038821,2:00:45,Mbuyiseli Mtshitshi,she should come back tomorrow
