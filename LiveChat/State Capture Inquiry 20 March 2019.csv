1553070018996391,47:14,Derek Main,"@carnoth ngomane My take is that I'll study all the party's election manifestos before the election and then decide who serves my interests best. It won't be the ANC, DA or EFF."
1553070022122610,47:18,Siviwe Slara,@ carnoth ngomane As long as it is not DA.

1553070610615821,57:06,Thulani Bukani,@myanc has finished this country. Our children and grand children will judge us harshly for voting for these thugs. It‚Äôs basically apartheid 2.0.
1553070612605753,57:08,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane I think anyone who has witnessed how the ANC has destroyed SA and still votes for them is a fool.
1553070617646597,57:13,Desmond Masilela,@kagiso william. Even the Jug is almost half and the guy is not even sited for more than an hour.
1553070629479445,57:25,M T,Did Gordhan mention that they are awaiting diesel? How could he NOT have been AWARE of the TRUE situation? Rather concerning!

1553071027142150,1:04:02,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,According to IPSOS the DA dropped by about 3% from its 2014 electoral support.

1553071137446582,1:05:53,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,According to IPSOS the EFF gained by about 3% from its 2014 electoral support.
1553071197376184,1:06:53,Derek Main,"@carnoth ngomane You are right - I do hate the ANC. I didn't always but seeing what they have done to SA has changed my mind. If you vote for them regardless, you're a fool."

1553071280943456,1:08:16,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,@carnoth ngomane He always hated South Africa and thus he is spreading propaganda and insulting voters for exercising their choice.
1553071357813080,1:09:33,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main Zuma's tenure was disastrous indeed but now that Cyril is at the helm im gonna give ANC my vote irrespective of your view
1553071363275869,1:09:39,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,"‚ÄúThe DA may not achieve an outright victory in the Western Cape,‚Äù predicts IPSOS. The ANC has strong support in the rural areas of the Western Cape"
1553071380620187,1:09:56,Derek Main,@Nosiphiwo Zantsi The ANC election lists are telling. A bigger bunch of criminals would be hard to group together. And that is what the fool ANC members want to let loose on SA.
1553071425424964,1:10:41,Derek Main,"@carnoth ngomane You can't fool me with this ""New Dawn"" nonsense. Still the same ANC - even Ramaphosa was there all along."
1553071452950457,1:11:08,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane Where's the collective responsibility?
1553071461993926,1:11:18,M T,#Derek Main. üëèüèª PreZactly!

1553071473751901,1:11:29,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,"The poll suggests, and the DA did itself no favours by internal fights which saw it lose focus. It also says it is unlikely that the party will win the Northern Cape."
1553071507291048,1:12:03,Desmond Masilela,And to discuss on state capture nothing els.
1553071525562640,1:12:21,Derek Main,@Nosiphiwo Zantsi I'm no fan of the DA either. They're almost as bad as the ANC.
1553071537780514,1:12:33,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main then who can better run this country according to you?
1553071584229746,1:13:20,11soccerdad,"Gwede Mantashe is the real head of state capture. Now he will make us suffer until we demand the nuclear plant, so he doesn't have to pay back his huge Russian bribe."
1553071606919870,1:13:42,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane Clearly anybody would do a better job than the ANC - I'm happy to let my local stokvel have a go - they'd do a better job.
1553071610146626,1:13:45,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,"Ramaphosa is the most popular politician in the country by far,‚Äù says IPSOS"
1553071630218321,1:14:05,carnoth ngomane,"@Derek Main you cant keep telling us not to vote for ANC yet you cant provide an alternative, thats foolish from where i stand"
1553071684252044,1:15:00,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,Ramaphosa notches up a favourability ranking of 6.71 out of 10

1553071723097591,1:15:38,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,@Peter Staffen How is IPSOS owned by the ANC?
1553071730627207,1:15:46,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane I'll try to explain this one more time (I know you're an ANC supporter). I will study all party's election manifestos once they release them and decide who serves my interests best.
1553071765025627,1:16:20,PETER STAFFEN,Nosiphiwo Zantsi i dont have to spell it out to you
1553071804689429,1:17:00,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,To say IPSOS is ANC is one of the craziest things I have ever heard. The EFF is the most succesfull party in terms of growth in this survey.
1553071873609556,1:18:09,jjkrew,the eef is the dumbest party only know to scream
1553071877805898,1:18:13,PETER STAFFEN,i did the testing on G5 and G6 artillaiary way back in 1979/80
1553071892839651,1:18:28,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main you cant fool me sir? You are a DA and wmc staunch your hatred to people who like ANC says it all
1553071953413407,1:19:29,Felix Muyoba,@Peter Staffen so what? those things were used to kill our freedom fighters
1553071954843705,1:19:30,M T,"#Nosiphiwo EFF has gained supporters yes, because violence is their supporters motto, too! Yeah, what a ‚Äúbloody‚Äù evil bunch."
1553071976417103,1:19:52,Derek Main,"@carnoth ngomane Sorry to burst your bubble - I'm not DA or EFF or ANC or any other party. I don't treat political parties like soccer teams. If hey mess up, they lose my support. Simple."
1553072003375124,1:20:18,jjkrew,this inquiry is exactly the reason y the anc cant lead this country
1553072025131890,1:20:41,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,@carnoth ngomane You got him. He is not as independent as he portrays himself.
1553072065016267,1:21:20,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,According to this pol the EFF will replace DA as the official opposition in Gauteng.
1553072068652033,1:21:24,Derek Main,@Nosiphiwo Zantsi You can believe your own BS - you're an ANC supporter so I know you're challenged
1553072078666790,1:21:34,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main unfortunately for you sir ANC will win the election com 8th may with or without your hatred
1553072104412992,1:22:00,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane Yes - they will - because we have so many fools in SA.
1553072107987203,1:22:03,M T,I was never a Trump person - but WoW üòÆ he sure is making USA great again! BiiiiG things happening there! üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
1553072117462345,1:22:13,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,@carnoth ngomane He probably wishes that his 1 vote counted more.
1553072153005170,1:22:48,carnoth ngomane,"@Derek Main yest they messed up but if there people who wanna vote for so be it , its their democratic right"
1553072171940886,1:23:07,makhosi nobhatyi,"Inquiry helps the country to know what went wrong, does the president influence executive to benefit from government tenders by his family and friends"
1553072191766883,1:23:27,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane Yes - it is their right - it doesn't make it any less stupid.
1553072193281497,1:23:29,M T,#Derek Main - can‚Äôt reason with the unreasonable ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The comments make it perfectly clear. Blood Seekers.
1553072244241995,1:24:20,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,"The Minister of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, is less visible but more popular than the Maimane and Malema : she measured at 4.28/10 in the rankings.(IPSOS)"
1553072257905729,1:24:33,PETER STAFFEN,Felix Muyoba now you have convinced me that you a idiot if you read my statement i did the original testing on the guns i did kill anybody it was in developement stage.
1553072292802242,1:25:08,carnoth ngomane,"@Derek Main unfortunately for you, you will be under the governance of those fools, that must be sore"
1553072310638953,1:25:26,Derek Main,@Nosiphiwo Zantsi Now that is telling too. The very person that would have continued Zuma's state capture is popular among the ANC members. How stupid can you be?
1553072335035355,1:25:50,makhosi nobhatyi,"Zuma lied to South Africa and the ANC, I don‚Äôt remember anyone who was sent to government to do corruption, its greediness within individuals, which is a faction that is fighting back"
1553072338570337,1:25:54,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,"@Peter Staffen The most conservative polster, IRR lead by former DA staffer, still says the ANC will win the elections."
1553072355803686,1:26:11,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane Yes it is painful. I fell SA could soar if only we could get rid of the ANC.
1553072430829451,1:27:26,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi What happened to collective responsibility? To try to blame it all on Zuma is disingenuous - the entire ANC is corrupt.
1553072449795676,1:27:45,carnoth ngomane,"@Derek Main clearly you cant get rid of Anc, for there is no better alternative so take your pain to you grave"
1553072451195645,1:27:47,makhosi nobhatyi,"You must understand that Zuma did what he did on his behalf not for ANC, we sent him to serve people nothing else, it is disturbing really what he did"
1553072455194917,1:27:51,PETER STAFFEN,Nosiphiwo Zantsi i am fully aware of this but not by that margin
1553072457064749,1:27:52,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,Have you dumped Trotsky @African Refugee ?
1553072477833889,1:28:13,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane To many idiots around.
1553072518114720,1:28:53,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main and you are one of them
1553072539256192,1:29:15,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,"‚ÄúRamaphosa is carrying the election for the ANC. He has built its credibility,‚Äù says IPSOS. That is why so mych personal attack on Ramaphosa by these ANC haters."
1553072542094032,1:29:17,Felix Muyoba,@carnoth ngomane haha
1553072545683209,1:29:21,Derek Main,"@makhosi nobhatyi As we have seen from these commissions, he wasn't the only one."
1553072566478796,1:29:42,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane No - I don't vote ANC anymore - I've seen the light.
1553072578730041,1:29:54,M T,#African Refugee üëçüèª On Point.
1553072615963762,1:30:31,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main that was a strategy to come things down if you see how loud those who were close to Zuma, if we pushed that ANC would split and be a war, Zuma was controlling all institutions"
1553072624801393,1:30:40,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main you have never voted for ANC and you never will
1553072676367088,1:31:32,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane And you know this how? I'll never vote for them again.
1553072681931672,1:31:37,M T,Rama is as BAD! A liar through & through! Only his eloquence & tupperware toothed smile ... fooled SOME. üëπ
1553072733026687,1:32:29,carnoth ngomane,"@makhosi nobhatyi stop explaining yourelf, these people are angry because ANCddnt split after Zuma's removal"
1553072734008267,1:32:30,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main yes he was not alone, he was a mastermind, he hired ministers so highly decisions makers which lead Gupta to get in"
1553072868098460,1:34:43,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi OK - so you're now admitting it's not only Zuma. I put it to you that it stretches right down to municipalities - there is corruption at all levels of govt - thanks to the ANC.
1553072909349313,1:35:25,makhosi nobhatyi,"Carnoth ngomane not that ANC couldn‚Äôt see what Zuma did problem is he like to play victim, he will never take responsibility and people down ordinary may say we are fighting him, so this is time"
1553072948203712,1:36:03,Derek Main,@African Refugee Yep - the rot runs deep in the ANC.
1553072966104103,1:36:21,M T,üéØ
1553073050899983,1:37:46,M T,#African Refugee - Exactly! And as we know ... maggots only feed on rotting flesh. Makes sense.
1553073091531031,1:38:27,Derek Main,@African Refugee She was probably too honest to belong to the ANC.
1553073094088151,1:38:29,makhosi nobhatyi,"Derek main as head of the nation should fight corruption not you as president get involved how do you expect that happen? Security agencies, police, sars, and NPA was captured and controlled by him"
1553073140205911,1:39:16,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Yes they were - and they are all still there - including Ramaphosa
1553073192121376,1:40:08,M T,They can‚Äôt have somebody who would stifle their ‚Äò93 organized plan.
1553073233057421,1:40:48,makhosi nobhatyi,"African refugee look things you may do during your time as someone in control but results will come after you, people who will experience that are the one who come after you"
1553073238442416,1:40:54,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi You can't fob off all the country's ills on Zuma. Many other players were (and still are) involved in corruption.
1553073378393866,1:43:14,M T,"#makhosi . Yip, the bigger mess will be left to our children & grandchildren! This crap just moves from one generation to the next - What a great üíî inheritance."
1553073432036108,1:44:07,makhosi nobhatyi,"Derek main Zuma is number one, right he lied and he always saying people are planning about him using security agencies to spread lies here‚Äôs the evidence now , records that he has hand"
1553073459961172,1:44:35,Michael Michael,Some people played a big role for destroying our country.without pointing fingers we know them they know them selfs
