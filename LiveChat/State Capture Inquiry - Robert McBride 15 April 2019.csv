1555316572518499,46:45,jeevan singh,"if all South Africans come together as one people, we will be the most popular and powerful nation in the world."
1555316622778036,47:36,Magda Seguin,Mugabe was rushed to Singapore for medical treatment.Just goes to show how he destroyed his country that he has no faith in his own health system.Its an African problem.Mabuza was treated in Russia
1555316668372112,48:21,Magda Seguin,Even the Nigerian president was treated in the UK for months...disgraceful
1555316734122804,49:27,jeevan singh,Magda very true. we have divisions amongst all of our people. And that is going to destroy us. Nothing else.
1555316767111265,50:00,Ifeanyi Anyaoha,Nigerian President was treated in UK hospital just for ear infection
1555316778461936,50:11,Nelson Musoliwa,Policing the police is a daunting task and dangerous one if parliamentary committee watch dog is not objective as ours was.
1555316820457424,50:53,Magda Seguin,Is that true? So apparently ear infections can't be treated in Nigeria...how crazy
1555316892819182,52:06,Magda Seguin,Politicians lie constantly and gullible people believe and vote for them time after time
1555316903744385,52:17,jeevan singh,Africa. The past stopped in 1994. 25 years later we are more divided as a people than we were before. more poor. more unemployed. more uneducated more corrupt. more and more and more.
1555316921214990,52:34,Magda Seguin,@Afrika that is not true..
1555316943823892,52:57,Nelson Musoliwa,Someone said Africa is a grave yard because when its leaders fall ill thay are treated in Europe or else where but when they die they are buried in Africa
1555316976644694,53:30,Magda Seguin,Do you know of other heads of states or politicians coming to Africa for medical treatment?
1555316999242799,53:52,Felix Muyoba,"@Nelson Musoliwa you have a point there, my brother"
1555317027306785,54:20,Magda Seguin,We have brilliant medical professionals but they are forced to leave yhe coubtry due to bad government policies
1555317037464579,54:30,Derek Main,@Nelson Musoliwa That's because we allow our leaders to get away with it.
1555317056478949,54:49,jeevan singh,Magda true
1555317082436231,55:15,Felix Muyoba,I cant understand what is so special about europe..
1555317100901510,55:34,Wildthing,SA needs law and order back. and people doing wrong should be placed in jail. otherwise we will not go anywhere but backwards and criminals will rule.
1555317109096452,55:42,Magda Seguin,I rest my case...its your choice to believe what you believe...btw I am not illiterate or dumb
1555317204691323,57:17,carnoth ngomane,"@Michael Wild i agree with you, all corrupt individuals should be jailed and that will bring back public confidence in our justice system"
1555317231680031,57:44,Nelson Musoliwa,@Derek imagine if we all got lot of money to be treated outside our country for any illness it would render our own health system useless.
1555317259969244,58:13,jeevan singh,We need a new government. that Ace Magushle. hey that gangster guy. don't trust that man. wants to topple Cyril Ramaphosa. hey man. I'm scared for South Africa.
1555317296275041,58:49,Magda Seguin,"There are hundreds if unemployed doctors that completed their community service,a moratorium by government is hampering our health system...so times doctors in public service are not paid for months"

1555317509183058,1:02:22,Magda Seguin,Chouette! tout va bien alors
1555317555727029,1:03:09,carnoth ngomane,"@Afika Centane The Polokwne Conference was the down fall of the ANC, Populists where elected instead of intellects"
1555317573672784,1:03:26,Magda Seguin,Tes the two emails that Werksmans produced this morning was debunked by McBride's testimony
1555317595630598,1:03:49,Michael Michael,oz'
1555317649889033,1:04:43,Magda Seguin,The Constitional court judgements proved IPID's independence and that the Minister of Police at the time interfered
1555317806447391,1:07:20,Derek Main,@Nelson Musoliwa Yes - it should be a law that all government ministers must use public facilities.
1555317811609098,1:07:24,Robert Russell,Whilst I'm happy that he has come forward to the commission I still have a issue looking at him... knowing he killed innocent people.... especially young adults who had their lives ended by him.
1555317872481038,1:08:25,Derek Main,"@Nelson Musoliwa Theri kids must go to government schools, they must use government health facilities and public transport. Then the situation might improve for the rest of us."
1555317888052264,1:08:41,Musa Bakiti,@Robert Russell he killed white people
1555317904937531,1:08:58,carnoth ngomane,@Thando Nkutha lol
1555317933694618,1:09:26,Magda Seguin,@Robert Russell I feel that way about de Klerk knowing his regime killed thousands
1555317934361945,1:09:27,Robert Russell,And that makes it OK ?????
1555317964202699,1:09:57,Robert Russell,I think PW was more to blame then De Klerk
1555318005924627,1:10:39,carnoth ngomane,@Robert Russell why blame PW?
1555318010259899,1:10:43,Lew464,"Magda Seguin , what ""thousands"" are you referring to?"
1555318026266151,1:10:59,Nelson Musoliwa,@ Derek i agree with you because they can not give their all to the improvement of facilities that they do not utilize. It is daylight robbery.
1555318139157100,1:12:52,Magda Seguin,@Lew464 try to learn about apartheid history..it's a shame that apartheid worked so well that we don't know about each other's pain and suffering.
1555318163080817,1:13:16,carnoth ngomane,@Thando Nkutha I get you bro
1555318348031850,1:16:21,Nelson Musoliwa,@Magda you are raised a crucial point in struggle point of view really. Undesirable that the oppressed could not consolidate their sufferings on a common ground
1555318376462655,1:16:49,Robert Russell,I am not condoning the actions of the security forces etc. but taking the lives of innocent civilians is not cool.if MK was a ligit military outfit they would have complied with the Geneva convention
1555318508399525,1:19:01,Magda Seguin,So how many innocent civilians do you think died during 40 years of apartheid?
1555318535844313,1:19:29,Magda Seguin,When the casspirs entered the townships nobody was safe
1555318580854453,1:20:14,Magda Seguin,Security forces? against the majority of a population to uphold a racist regime?
1555318607512072,1:20:41,Robert Russell,I agree with you... I don't condone it from any side on the debate.... but some people think it's ok because they are white... and that's why we we will never move on as country...
1555318616019779,1:20:49,Derek Main,@Robert Russell Unfortunately the Geneva convention is no longer worth the paper it is written on. The US regularly flouts it with their actions around the world.
1555318643186949,1:21:16,Magda Seguin,As long as part of South Africans are in denial about apartheid we will never be able to reconcile
1555318664964880,1:21:38,Robert Russell,Yeah but I'm talking about in the early 70's @Derek Main
1555318725089433,1:22:38,Jack Sparrow,"@Magda Seguin estimates are about 10000 deaths, but no idea how many were civilian"
1555318750842652,1:23:04,Magda Seguin,In the 80's if you didn't get home drenched in teargas and given 5 minutes to disperse with helicopters hovering above you will never know what we went through
1555318800705735,1:23:54,Robert Russell,who has denied apartheid existed or the atrocities that it gave the majority of the country??? @Magda Seguin
1555318806042966,1:23:59,Magda Seguin,@Jack...I don't consider that number as remotely accurate
1555318831562267,1:24:24,Jack Sparrow,@Magda Seguin yet it's quite well documented
1555318978139751,1:26:51,Magda Seguin,I don't know @Robert just judge g from the comments here makes me think that it is a microcosm of denialism
1555319027594091,1:27:40,Pheladi Lamola,I love DCJ Zondo's mind.
1555319254565380,1:31:27,Lew464,"Magda Seguin , currently, more people are killed per annum than the number blamed on apartheid over a 40 year period. Who do you blame for this?"
1555319299297327,1:32:12,Dilip Badal,Mr Mc Bride uses the term .. common sense should prevail... did he use his commom sense in regards to the Magoos bar bombing ?? i think not.. just glad he has been terminated from his duties
1555319450282938,1:34:43,Magda Seguin,@Lew464 I am not going to engage on semantics with you
1555319518871696,1:35:52,Ndim Mavuks,"Dilip pls read the TRC transcript, It might help you understand the Magoo's Bar incident instead of relying on the lies of the apartheid propaganda machinery"
1555319522122317,1:35:55,Robert Russell,@Dilip Badal ... I think he did not use common sense killing innocent young people.... how does and action like that make any kind of sense ????
1555319545310848,1:36:18,Robert Russell,*any action
1555319557176852,1:36:30,Magda Seguin,This is the apartheid denialism and apologetic approach that Holocoast denialists also come up with.
1555319584245603,1:36:57,Dilip Badal,"@Magda Seguin ..Lew464 asks a valid question... you should reply accordingly, as you are already involved in .. asyou say semantics.."
1555319609100866,1:37:22,Magda Seguin,I don't pander to apartheid denialism
1555319628689221,1:37:42,Thami Ngwenya,How does killing 22 year old brutaly through the gallows make sense
1555319643123415,1:37:56,Dilip Badal,"@Robert Russell ..absolutely correct,,, hence me asking"
1555319643943453,1:37:57,makhosi nobhatyi,"Those who did wrong must face consequences of their action, at the time of our democracy we shall not be made mistakes to pick up individuals who must be prostituted, law should apply to all"
1555319646063634,1:37:59,Magda Seguin,Making excuses for a crime against humanity makes you complicit
1555319695412006,1:38:48,Ndim Mavuks,"Was there any common sense as far as the whole racist apartheid system is concerned including the actions of Wouter Basson, Dirk Coetzee and others?"
1555319772472700,1:40:06,Robert Russell,And killing innocent civilians makes it ok to take the law into your hands?????
1555319805798318,1:40:39,Magda Seguin,A sane and logical person should condemn ALL violence...not in isolation when it suits their agenda
1555319848958195,1:41:22,Derek Main,"@makhosi nobhatyi If they all faced the consequences for their actions, they ANC would be in serious trouble. They'd have very leaders left."
1555319891901115,1:42:05,Robert Russell,@Ndim Mavuks absolutely not... there was no sense at all in all the killings.... we could have way down the road by now of having a integrated country if the senseless killings were avoided
1555319902537338,1:42:15,Magda Seguin,I NEVER said it's ok to kill civilians..I just find it strange that people who mentions McBride' s actions must look in the mi...those who supported apartheid
1555319922192905,1:42:35,Ndim Mavuks,"We buried 10, 11 yrs and younger children killed by the apartheid police and some of remains of others cannot even be found up to this day and yet you want to tell us about common sense"
1555319997740796,1:43:51,makhosi nobhatyi,"Before we can criticize past, let us ask ourselves what went in the black house? We need to correct things not getting out of hand please current status core shows something is not right"
1555320014188124,1:44:07,Magda Seguin,Just say outright that you maybe hoped Mc Bride was hanged...he was on death row like so many others.
1555320057677698,1:44:50,Robert Russell,and I see that children are being used again in service delivery protests in Enerdale today.... what do you expect to happen... someone is going to get hurt or killed....
1555320083188392,1:45:16,Magda Seguin,@makhosi don't change the subject...this is a specific discourse...we are all against the looting of the ANC and corporates.
1555320115348563,1:45:48,makhosi nobhatyi,"These commission will help us to know what went wrong? And also give us a chance to fix it, and avoid not happening again in our time"
1555320165479266,1:46:38,Magda Seguin,My last words on this...somebody said over the weekend that the Apartheid regime and the past 24 years plus is exactly the same thing.We are still being oppressed...just a different oppressor.
1555320177521243,1:46:50,Magda Seguin,And I agree
1555320277750892,1:48:31,makhosi nobhatyi,"Magda Seguin I am not changing anything I don‚Äôt defend corruption, I am against it in all odds but what I don‚Äôt want is to butter everyone with it, those people did wrong must come to account"
1555320430248905,1:51:03,PATRICK MANALA,some people will be shocked by state capture and will vote anc come may
1555320454401332,1:51:27,Ndim Mavuks,The Magoo's Bar incident was a legitimate military target as it was frequented by the apartheid army officers unlike the earlier Sharpeville massacre. McBride remains a hero of the liberation struggle
1555320468210084,1:51:41,Robert Russell,How about this... R29m for a guards hut and ANOTHER R29m for gates and a dog kennel at one of our ministers houses.... this could build at least 580 RDP houses.... that ANC government for you.
1555320704903688,1:55:38,Rusty SpyGoat,"If we lived in any other country or society, having witnessed the utter corruption and lack of service delivery that the ANC is responsible for, the ANC would not be in rule. However this is SA"
1555320715265492,1:55:48,Antonie Goosen,"@ Ndim Mavuks ""Military"" Seriously ?? They were terrorists and committed terrorist acts! Nothing military about it"
1555320873213130,1:58:26,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Magda Seguin I agreed with what you have heard,we are oppressed by our own corrupt comrade whom boldly saying they are representing people yet working to enrich themselves, ANC never corrupt"
1555321087911103,2:02:01,Ndim Mavuks,"Then white arrogance declared ""no one is to blame"" for the senseless people of more than 60 people"
1555321091077882,2:02:04,Magda Seguin,"@Rust true...look how the Sudanese deposed Bashir after a 30 year dictatorship,ditto Algeria.We can learn from their peaceful actions"
1555321156451957,2:03:09,Magda Seguin,@makhosi and Ace has the gall to do door to door with a straight face
1555321169941097,2:03:23,Frank Lowe,Open Robin island again for those criminals and make is a tourists attraction.
1555321292668259,2:05:25,makhosi nobhatyi,"Anc is in a process to correct this problem, you must understand that when changes happened not everyone will accept or just move immediately there will be more engagement and discussion"
1555321394706110,2:07:07,Derek Main,@PATRICK MANALA That is true and they are nothing but fools.
1555321526605906,2:09:19,Ndim Mavuks,Makhosi you are correct that is why we will give the ANC a 2/3 majority
1555321675667345,2:11:48,Rusty SpyGoat,"Praising the ""liberation struggle"" is more anecdotal than what actually led to the end of apartheid. What really stopped apartheid was international economic and political pressure."
1555321677689381,2:11:50,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi @Ndim Mavuks You must be fools to vote for a party that has proven to be so corrupt. You are voting for more of the same.
1555321731161957,2:12:44,Rusty SpyGoat,It's the same as praising the 'Jewish struggle' for the defeat of the Nazi's. When in actual fact it was the allied forces that defeated the Nazi's..
1555321887378128,2:15:20,Ndim Mavuks,Rusty I align myself more with the political that led to economic and international pressure and Derek it is too late to try and convince us with insults with just a few days to go before elections
1555321933781935,2:16:07,Abel Manyedi,where's d chair bathong
1555321940423669,2:16:13,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks I know you can't be convinced. I'm just telling you you're a fool if you can't see the ANC is corrupt to the core.

1555322235560055,2:21:08,Magda Seguin,@Rusty it is correct in part as the Apartheid government was brought to it's knees by both the struggle and external pressure due to the international work done by Oliver Tambo and his team outside SA
1555322241179872,2:21:14,Lew464,"Rusty SpyGoat , When equal opportunity becomes a reality...maybe."

1555322367456699,2:23:20,Jack Sparrow,@Ndim Mavuks is missing the point
1555322387234831,2:23:40,Rusty SpyGoat,"Lew464 but how do we achieve equal opportunity? It seems to be so far away. Not only in SA but look at USA, England, Australia and all other 'multicultural countries.."
1555322397699440,2:23:51,Ndim Mavuks,Then what is the point?
1555322402924079,2:23:56,Eslon Eslon,Any name dropping today?
1555322414951420,2:24:08,Derek Main,"@Ndim Mavuks Have you not been listening to anything at this commission?? You need to take your blinkers off. It seems the problem is not the ANC, it's the ANC voters."

1555322499714153,2:25:32,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks The point is that the ANC is corrupt to the core and their members can't seem to see it.
1555322519585215,2:25:52,Lew464,"Rusty SpyGoat , let's start by scrapping BEE. Initially it was OK but restricting/penalising less than 10% of the population...?"
1555322520052598,2:25:53,Robert Russell,Exactly the truth of the matter.... the ANC are a collective... and so are their voters... both morally corrupt.... @Derek Main
1555322538346136,2:26:11,Magda Seguin,Most of the countries mentioned diversity is due to immigration
1555322550419508,2:26:23,Derek Main,@Robert Russell Hence why I say the ANC is corrupt to the core.
1555322578733489,2:26:51,Ndim Mavuks,"Tell me of one testimony in this commission that explicitly said ""The ANC is corrupt"" with facts and evidence"
1555322602597000,2:27:15,Magda Seguin,It is thus more difficult to achieve unity and equality
1555322615906199,2:27:29,KT M,"So the truth is we can‚Äôt just forget what happened during apartheid, n its current side effects (whites benefited immensely during that era) hence blacks n others r very poor 2day n live in squatters"
1555322616037106,2:27:29,Alexander Dowding,Justice Zondo has the most incredible voice. Could listen to it for hours
1555322630919147,2:27:44,Magda Seguin,In SA
1555322631029447,2:27:44,Derek Main,"@Ndim Mavuks I don't need someone to explicitly say ""The ANC is corrupt"". It can be deduced from the evidence so far."
1555322648479220,2:28:01,Le Roux Strydom,SOUND!!!
1555322672114613,2:28:25,Cerebis,"@Derek Main I totally agree that the ANC is corrupt to the core! With the Top 6 we can see it clearly. 4 of them are Zuptas, 1 sits on the fence and only the President has some integrity?"
1555322695032419,2:28:48,Le Roux Strydom,Thank You!!
1555322706849126,2:29:00,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks Can you honestly say that none of the evidence here has pointed any fingers at ANC members?
1555322734573264,2:29:27,Rusty SpyGoat,"Magda Seguin SA is not the most diverse country in the world. It is very diverse no doubt, But USA has migrants from many European and African countries and many Mexicans and other latinos and Asians"
1555322752038913,2:29:45,Derek Main,@Cerebis Yes exactly - look at the bunch of criminals they have put forward for us to vote for.
1555322755158630,2:29:48,Robert Russell,@Derek Main ... releax you speaking to ANC Vota...<80.... what you expect???
1555322756971193,2:29:50,Alexander Dowding,Never forget Marikana. Ramaphosa‚Äôs hands are not clean
1555322768648702,2:30:01,Magda Seguin,The US diversity is very recent history
1555322794774560,2:30:27,Mohamed Kodi,hello friends!
1555322798463546,2:30:31,Magda Seguin,Apart from the US colonizers that mostly came from Italy and Ireland
1555322845939398,2:31:19,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks I understand your historic connections to the ANC but that organisation is dead a long time ago. The ANC of today is an entirely different animal. Time for you to find a new hero.
1555322854469961,2:31:27,Lew464,"Thato Kelebohile Makgomatha , what do you say about countries who never experienced a form of colonialism who are worse off than S.A.? Who do you blame there?"
1555322875405093,2:31:48,Magda Seguin,Yes South Africa is the most diverse...medical researchers call it the 'natural laborotary' due to the genetic pool
1555322882737504,2:31:55,Robert Russell,"and your ""glorious liberation movement"" keeps crooks and thieves in parliament... nice one @Ndim Mavuks"
1555322893458875,2:32:06,Cerebis,"@Derek Main jip, Ace and his bunch was in charge of selecting some highly suspect people and if elected, their loyalty in Parliament will be for the Zupta camp!"
1555322929749155,2:32:42,Derek Main,@Cerebis One thing you can be sure of with Ace is that he is plotting something. He's a gangster.
1555322952662902,2:33:05,Magda Seguin,Time out
1555322981652138,2:33:34,Cerebis,???
1555323013796964,2:34:06,Derek Main,@Cerebis Ace is busy setting up a parallel government.
1555323024856550,2:34:17,Magda Seguin,Best just to follow the proceedings...too tiring on this forum
1555323027427057,2:34:20,Robert Russell,@Derek Main not according to @Ndim Mavuks all in the ANC are heroes... LOL!!!!
1555323047277477,2:34:40,Cerebis,@Derek Main I agree!!
1555323067360883,2:35:00,Eslon Eslon,"@Alexander Dowdinng... Stop propagating, Ramaphosa was cleared of any wrong doing by legally constituted commission of inquiry into the Marikana massacre"
1555323067459784,2:35:00,Rusty SpyGoat,Ndim Mavuks Tell me one testimony in this commission that explicitly said anyone is corrupt? This is an enquiry. This is not a criminal prosecution.
1555323084785246,2:35:18,Cerebis,@Magda Seguin Agree Magda.....Stick to your our advise please?
1555323129296728,2:36:02,Ndim Mavuks,Pls Rusty tell that to Derek
1555323136900667,2:36:10,Alexander Dowding,Eslon. If you believe that I have a bridge to sell you
1555323161683282,2:36:34,Antonie Goosen,The struggle continues! Struggle to steal. loot and keep the sheep voting for the cANCer
1555323179587145,2:36:52,makhosi nobhatyi,"DA failed to go to listen to the people of Alex , what did they do went to media saying protest was sponsored by ANC, but has a mayor failed to go and listen to them, ANC go and respond"
1555323252080863,2:38:05,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks @Rusty SpyGoat As I said Ndim (and I know you have some difficulty comprehending) - it doesn't have to be stated explicitly - it is possible to hear evidence given and form an opinion.
1555323305623670,2:38:58,Rusty SpyGoat,"Derek Main I get that, I think Ndim Mavuks misunderstood me"
1555323317716148,2:39:10,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi What both the DA and the ANC are doing in Alex is shameful. Just finger-pointing with no accountability while the people suffer.
1555323318630617,2:39:11,Brian Mercado,"This farce will continue. Only the players will change. One needs to show remorse at guilt. The politician just says ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt me‚Äù, and move on. How sad!!"
1555323347768804,2:39:41,Robert Russell,So who was held accountable and was prosecuted for teh death of 143 Life Esimeni tradgety.... NO ONE... they are ANC members.... how does that work????
1555323353098068,2:39:46,Eslon Eslon,@Alexander Dowding. So you refuse to accept the findings of that inquiry or what now?
1555323402032979,2:40:35,Ndim Mavuks,Robert who was held responsible for the Sharpville Massacre no one
1555323408740274,2:40:41,Brian Mercado,The Godfather of Alex is sitting comfortably in parliament. Maybe the next book will be about him?
1555323460672419,2:41:33,makhosi nobhatyi,"If Mashaba just went there without points fingering, if you had listen to the president saying he doesn‚Äôt need politics when it comes to respond to the problem wat people to own up and respond"
1555323502600567,2:42:15,Robert Russell,FFS.... Ndim.... move on we are in a new democratic dispensation or as you missing the apartheid era way of doing things
1555323523169714,2:42:36,Derek Main,"@makhosi nobhatyi If you are trying to imply that the ANC is not using the Alex situation for politicking, then I call BS."
1555323555987450,2:43:09,Ndim Mavuks,Mashaba learnt the tendencies of white arrogance so prevalent today
1555323621149450,2:44:14,Derek Main,@Mandla cyril Mankoe I'll bet you believe in the tooth fairy too.
1555323639639441,2:44:32,Ndim Mavuks,Now we talking Mindlos

1555323801421254,2:47:14,Ndim Mavuks,"Thanks Rusty, white arrogance will tell us ""move on"""
1555323831834624,2:47:44,Antonie Goosen,@ Cerebis - Any ANC as President will NEVER be for ALL the people of SA - the anc will never allow that

1555323989274379,2:50:22,Rusty SpyGoat,Ndim Mavuks Nothing in my statement insinuated 'move on'. At least I acknowledge the suffering caused to black South Africans. You however lack empathy to sympathize my greater loss.
1555323994580724,2:50:27,Brian Mercado,"Probably true, except if you are a farmer?"
1555324048521096,2:51:21,Cerebis,@makhosi nobhatyi I want what is best for South Africa and currently view all politicians as a huge part of the Problem!!

1555324167986224,2:53:21,Brian Mercado,I agree regarding the future of SA. It seems politicians are inherently criminal. Old dispensation or new dispensation the problem appears to be the same
1555324229534498,2:54:22,koena jonas,All thanks to EFF with their findings of state capture....
1555324234789884,2:54:28,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ cerebis we all need what is best for South Africa no one should politicized people problem, if people protest saying I am not going to Santon coz they support DA no that show you are incompetent"

1555324739540238,3:02:52,makhosi nobhatyi,"We don‚Äôt need people who will feel nice when she or he sees media, we want people to be accountable to the society and sees pain, Mashaba was shaken by protest even former mayor of Cptn was not respnd"

1555324774104412,3:03:27,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi I put it to you that the ANC is not capable of fixing problems they created in the first place. You're only fooling yourself.
1555324854136917,3:04:47,Derek Main,@Mandla cyril Mankoe True - the only problem is the ANC bag would be empty.
1555324913807169,3:05:47,Derek Main,@Brian Mercado That's right - we have just changed one set of corrupt politicians with another.
1555325000728165,3:07:13,Derek Main,"@carnoth ngomane You're going to get my advice anyway. Use it, don't use it."
1555325009295182,3:07:22,makhosi nobhatyi,"There many protesters across the country where the ANC lead or DA lead, when they respond they never pointing fingers saying saying it was sponsored by DA. DA always lead matches to ANC"

1555325073105879,3:08:26,Derek Main,"@Ndim Mavuks You're using the ANC stratgey of ""If you tell a lie often enough, it becomes the truth""."
1555325082776324,3:08:35,Nelson Musoliwa,@Brian as much as the struggle was prescribed to be fought with due diligent there was no doubt that civilians will at time be caught in cross fire so ja he unwittingly got involved
1555325097397515,3:08:50,Robert Russell,How can the ANC not be corrupt when they kept Zuma in power knowing what they did....@Ndim Mavuks
1555325152663888,3:09:46,BEE-llionaire Okwacha,dealt with when? @Ndim Mavuks when Jesus come back.
1555325157220796,3:09:50,Ndim Mavuks,"No I am repeating what you said Derek: ""corrupt politicians"" remember"
1555325166129220,3:09:59,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main then you are just wasting your time sir cos i know where i stand and i dont get moved any force whatsoever
1555325183127452,3:10:16,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main you need to understand we are not talking about who created, as a mayor should have gone and listen to the people not to be arrogant, tell people how he is going to fix these problems"
1555325189802003,3:10:22,Indra Reddy,ndim mavuks you totally right but if we could see at lease one jailed we know the ANC is serious right now they all playing for time and money leaving the country
1555325195555333,3:10:28,carnoth ngomane,@Ndim Mavuks you are correct
1555325213155075,3:10:46,Ndim Mavuks,After the 2/3 majority victory after the May 8 elections
1555325231061440,3:11:04,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane That's fine by me - I'm not going to stop saying it. You will wake up eventually.
1555325242531527,3:11:15,koena jonas,"even if u r saying its not the EFF, atleast they managed to bring the ZUPTA relationship to parliament's attention...."
1555325247291295,3:11:20,Nelson Musoliwa,I think Macbride didn't loose track of what we struggled for hene he did his best to continue fighting wrong things which even endangers his own life
1555325267743300,3:11:40,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main keep dreaming
1555325269864459,3:11:42,Themba J Thobela,we need to be quiet certain in decision making on the 8th of May
1555325298694519,3:12:11,Robert Russell,South Africa has a serious problem if the ANC gets a 2/3 majority.... first thing will be a credit down grade for sure.
1555325311212434,3:12:24,Cerebis,@Robert Russell That was the ANC parliamentarians not the common supporters. That is the big flaw in our electoral system highlights. Members and the President should be directly voted in.
1555325317964001,3:12:31,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main people was complaining about simple things, people who are not living at Alex come build shakes every space, illegal structures and removal of rubbish, so he failed"
1555325324545873,3:12:37,Derek Main,"@makhosi nobhatyi Absolutely, he should have gone to answer to the people. I am not going to protect the actions of the DA. What the ANC is doing to the people of Alex is just as shameful."
1555325378815148,3:13:31,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane And you keep your head stuck firmly in the sand.
1555325379475674,3:13:32,Robert Russell,The common voters should have shown their disapproval but didn't .... @Cerebis
1555325395087560,3:13:48,Themba J Thobela,"the only way to end corruption is to vote the ANC out,and give another party a chance."
1555325411140004,3:14:04,The Truth,"It's ""IPID"" chair, not ""iPad"" lol"
1555325423537454,3:14:16,Ndim Mavuks,The only hope for the country in terms of fighting corruption and reduce racialised unemployment and inequality is a decisive ANC victory as confirmed as confirmed by the ratings agencies
1555325434967357,3:14:28,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main the sand feels cooler than your advice
1555325476994325,3:15:10,Jack Sparrow,@Ndim Mavuks decisive ANC victories for 25 years haven't even dented unemployment
1555325482595111,3:15:15,Cerebis,"@Robert Russell Agree! Thay however only have a chance every 4 years. They have not used that opportunity. The voters vote for the ANC, but the Party appoints on a list the member of Parliament."
1555325483820002,3:15:17,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Why don't you tell us a bit about how the ANC cadres stole the money that was meant to be used for improvements in Alex?
1555325488226880,3:15:21,Themba J Thobela,90% of Anc officials are corrupt
1555325514173494,3:15:47,Derek Main,@Themba J Thobela A conservative estimate.
1555325566433133,3:16:39,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane Coming from someone who thinks the ANC is cool - that's no surprise.
1555325584528817,3:16:57,carnoth ngomane,"@Ndim Mavuks i dont agree, the ANC must ensure that its corrupt individual are jailed, in so doing half a job will be done."
1555325622901552,3:17:35,ofhie Muofhe,@Themba J Thobela where do you get those starts 90%
1555325628538183,3:17:41,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks Expecting the ANC to sort out corruption is like expecting the Ku Klux Klan to sort out racial prejudice.
1555325641868199,3:17:55,Cassius Mngomezulu,Holomisa is spitting fire at PIC
1555325661601216,3:18:14,carnoth ngomane,"@Derek Main thats your problem, you worry much about ANC, and yet you have no alternative"
1555325663619010,3:18:16,Ndim Mavuks,The ANC has over the years made a lot of progress and the majority knows it and yes ngomane dealing with the corrupt elements will surely follow
1555325707839456,3:19:00,Bonganjalo Marala,"Woow @Themba J Thobela , tell us more...Support your statement!"
1555325727504633,3:19:20,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane There are plenty of alternatives. It's just that the fool ANC supporters can't see the immense harm the ANC is doing to SA.
1555325731868897,3:19:25,Themba J Thobela,we are living in a country of enquiries and all of them are about looting
1555325750555850,3:19:43,carnoth ngomane,@Ndim Mavuks dealing with corrupt individual doesnt have to follow rather it must be done now than later
1555325760530955,3:19:53,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main hawks must come up with investigation look where is money and those who did wrong be charged, you need to understand Security agencies was captured defend corrupt people so we are busy fix"
1555325767918948,3:20:00,Derek Main,@Themba J Thobela And the common denominator in all the looting is the ANC.
1555325847958917,3:21:20,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main you are like a doctor who give diagnosis but cant advice on medication hence i dont take you serious.
1555325851085806,3:21:24,Kapn Krunch,security agencies only exist because the police are incompetent it's the private sector doing governments job for them
