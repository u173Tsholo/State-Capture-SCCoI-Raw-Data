1603093313991220,36:12,Bizana Ngesi,I am disgusted that Mr Mkhwanazi doesn't know the difference between a request and an instruction. He was INSTRUCTED to reinstate Mr Gama as a condition for him to be a Chair of Transnet.
1603093336510685,36:36,Anax B,there is need to completely overhaul the process of appointing board members. clearly the likes of this old man and Tsotsi have no business seating on any board.
1603093347921380,36:47,Andre Gerber,@Gerard Victor that as well
1603093387069527,37:27,Queen K,lying makes him look more stupid and lack backbone.

1603093597595568,40:56,Thabo Mokoaleli,There is no way that a reasonable Board can ignore three Law Companies that come into the same conclusion that Gama has no reasonable prospects of winning against Transnet 😅😂😝🙋
1603093604381934,41:04,Theo van Zijl,Malema is still looking for somebody who wants to donate him their kahunas as he does not have big enough kahunas to appear before Zondo

1603093685458108,42:23,Nathaniel Motlhasedi,they were looking for legal opinion that would suit their instructions. How many Legal opinions do you want???

1603094202795062,51:02,Dr Petrus Dumisa,Mr Mkhwanazi seems to have worked for the State Capture to ensure reinstating Mr Gama. He could not take a principle position as he was bias towards serving his master.
1603094209620064,51:08,joyce tendai Zvavareyi,I remember one witness stated that the chair wanted at least someone come up with something that could help him to articulate the position of getting Gama back
