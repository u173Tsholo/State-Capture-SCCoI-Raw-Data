1557393714328038,2:20:25,rohan barnard,"@The Truth the reason we complain is because yes, CR is waay better than JZ, he stood by JZ, supported his looting, his corrupt ministers and kept quiet. Why didn't he stand up for the nation?"

1557393823366928,2:22:13,The Truth,@rohan barnard He didnt publicly stand up because he didnt want to ruin the chances of taking over and fixing the mess. ABC's of politics
1557393860995784,2:22:51,Born free,I don't think any amount of rigging would make the difference.
1557393918616500,2:23:49,The Truth,"@Jessica Francis No, elections are not rigged. South African's are demonstrating their faith in the ANC, despite it's failures. Weather we like it or not"

1557394319996169,2:30:30,ROSE Star,It's due to scarcity of resources that make Africans mostly to look up to politics as a quick source to aquire easy wealth. Our natural resources are being given to the highest bidders as investment.
1557394334177073,2:30:44,Born free,Yes. South Africans will not tolerate any more corruption.
