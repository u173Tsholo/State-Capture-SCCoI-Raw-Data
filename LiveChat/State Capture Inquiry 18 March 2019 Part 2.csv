1552911771718092,19:48,Magda Seguin,@Yin Yang and to think they will get fat pensions when they retire...it should be stopped as it is taxpayers money

1552912771832861,36:29,Felix Muyoba,@Edward Patrick are you asking his own understanding or definition of technocracy because you can google it..
1552912779321104,36:35,Magda Seguin,You guys work in groups on social media...I know your MO
1552913940733204,55:56,Magda Seguin,Lyn Brown was completely captured
1552913990548353,56:46,Magda Seguin,Nine years of systematic breakdown of SOE's
1552914054203601,57:50,makhosi nobhatyi,Zupta involvements declines occurred dramatically
1552914055268513,57:51,Anne M.,"Sad, isn't it."
1552914113376798,58:50,Anne M.,"@makhosi nobhatyi Yes, in this case a 50% decline"
1552914167491940,59:43,Wildthing,has anyone asked why SA purchased weapons from Europe when we have Denel and they where leaders in some areas.
1552914195649850,1:00:12,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Anne M this embarrassing to black professional really, an insult to the poor people 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️"
1552914238638133,1:00:54,Anne M.,@Michael Wild Which brings us back full circle to the arms deal
1552914294144545,1:01:50,Wildthing,agreed was never needed
1552914342030128,1:02:38,Magda Seguin,The submarines are apparently not even in use
1552914484667408,1:05:01,Magda Seguin,Fana Hlongwane was the arms deal broker...Andrew Feinstein is an ex parliamentarian who wrote 'After the Party' explains it all as he was against buying the arms
1552914516999650,1:05:33,Anne M.,I don't remember where I read an article that stated few countries have done arms deals without there being some sort of kickback or corruption involved.
1552914582962115,1:06:39,Magda Seguin,Andrew Feinstein also wrote 'The Shadow World'...based on global arms deals and the bribery involved
1552914609445114,1:07:05,Anne M.,"Thanks Magda, might well have been his article."
1552914662749486,1:07:59,makhosi nobhatyi,"I can’t wait the day Zuma being arrested surely country will be demonize by those supporters who shield for him, make chaos"
1552914702569812,1:08:38,Magda Seguin,Andrew Feinstein was an ANC politician who resigned in disgust over the arms deal
1552914842187653,1:10:58,Magda Seguin,@makhosi Yes Zuma was involved in the arms deal...some of charges against him are still in progress
1552914925696398,1:12:21,Wildthing,That's a big statement he just made.
1552915051993421,1:14:28,makhosi nobhatyi,"@magda seguin I was supporting Zuma, I turned against him when he built inkandla I saw we in trouble, and changing ministers as if changing underwear, this man never take serious SA was a joke"
1552915118193183,1:15:35,Magda Seguin,@makhosi...we are all very traumatised and pained as ex ANC voters
1552915219531482,1:17:16,makhosi nobhatyi,Zuma creates a bill to protect information which is was to protect his shenanigans because they were shocked by revelation of Nkandla scandal
1552915220137969,1:17:16,Desmond Masilela,Its like they blackmail them
1552915267807602,1:18:04,Magda Seguin,I already decided that the Polokwane mess was the end and decided that I will never vote for the ruling party ...I have become apolitical
1552915393212100,1:20:10,makhosi nobhatyi,Magda Seguin I told myself I will vote for other party to give Anc lessons as we did in 2016 because there was no hears to listen but after Ramaphosa won I come back home coz I know him very well
1552915498987218,1:21:55,Anne M.,"@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG The commission's investigators are giving information to the NPA, so give them a chance"
1552915499373004,1:21:55,makhosi nobhatyi,Administration and policy implementation will happen in supervisory and no corruption will happen as you see him pushing very hard to bring back wat we have lost
1552915501744017,1:21:58,Desmond Masilela,"@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG. And all those ppl that are been implicated are back on ANC seat. the likes of Gigaba, Dlamini & Mokonyane"
1552915569922006,1:23:06,Felix Muyoba,@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG it is also for informing you (as a public member) what happened to your money unlike in your parents time (apartheid) where everything was secretive and if you question you dead..
1552915575606351,1:23:12,Anne M.,@Desmond Masilela I know the branches put their names forward but they should have done the proper thing by declining
1552915623821194,1:24:00,Magda Seguin,Some in the branches are also captured
1552915654148004,1:24:30,Felix Muyoba,"@Anne M. haa, who will decline the food on the table, wena?"
1552915667217332,1:24:43,makhosi nobhatyi,"I am very happy with what they sent to parliament, when the investigation revealed that someone broke the laws when she/he was in helm will be to step aside, we will beat them with their game"
1552915703426331,1:25:19,Desmond Masilela,@Anne M.. I think in this we should start to put blame on our current President. Dont you think so? who approve the names for ppl who are implicated?
1552915723248151,1:25:39,Anne M.,@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG The NPA has just appointed a new head - Shamila Batohi who served on the International Criminal Court
1552915768329055,1:26:24,Magda Seguin,Yes @Anne she is cleaning upcas we speak
1552915791489702,1:26:47,Desmond Masilela,@Anne M.. The NPA should have done something now. Just to set an example that something will happen.
1552915802664114,1:26:58,Bridgette Kekana,l m waiting for Supra Mahumapelo s name to b mention
1552915862956001,1:27:58,Anne M.,@Desmond Masilela I hear you
1552915941498274,1:29:17,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Masilela no President has nothing to do with candidates secretary does that, so NPA busy digging hard investigations about stina diary, even Ace Magashule will account, he will be arrested"
1552915966682490,1:29:43,Musa Bakiti,i am waiting the name of Mogosuthu Buthelezi of IFP to mentioned anywhere.The old man is so clean.
1552916030881718,1:30:47,Desmond Masilela,"@Anne M.. Remember what happened with Agrizzi, Just after he left the commission he was arrested, Why cant they do the same."
1552916048027187,1:31:04,Bridgette Kekana,@Makhosi l will b happy if Ace Magashule is arrested
1552916075873785,1:31:31,Anne M.,@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG And that might be exactly what the president is waiting for - then he can appoint his own cabinet without the current factionalism
1552916077668493,1:31:33,Sidwell Mashishi,"apartheid was in place formally since 1948 & before ofcos. Many decades of abuse, exclusion & etc. 25 years is nothing. SA will continue to suffer the consequences of apartheid for the next 150 years"
1552916090813127,1:31:46,Desmond Masilela,"The bomb is coming out now, guys. Listen to this man"
1552916098216749,1:31:54,makhosi nobhatyi,"President laying on laws to prove then act because these people talking too much know how to demonize poor people so only thing we trust is the law, commission outcome will prove that for us"
1552916106581584,1:32:03,Magda Seguin,"State capture destroyed so many lives and families...its an unknown,a matter thatvis never discussed.Zuma and his cronies are stillvliving large."
1552916121921574,1:32:18,Bridgette Kekana,@Desmond it is true
1552916173204448,1:33:09,Magda Seguin,@Stefan even if he is arrested he will be out in hours on bail and his lawyers will make sure that the cases are dragged out
