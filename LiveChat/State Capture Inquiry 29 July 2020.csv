1596009911469499,29:57,Mbuso Ndlovu,This guy looks corrupt to me
1596009931708687,30:17,Bev Daniels,"He is corrupt, he is called the fire pool at Nkandla"

1596010406752401,38:12,Bev Daniels,@Abel because he does not want to answer any questions in case he puts his foot in it.
1596010434262726,38:40,Avis Yetti,he is a pig at the public trough.
1596010472798721,39:18,Bev Daniels,No the kraal at Nkandla
1596010490611101,39:37,Alvino Theunissen,The Chair Zondo protecting Mr. Ntlheko's not acceptable that is the duty of his lawyer.
1596010502755319,39:48,Abel Matshidiso,he seems to not like saying a simple yes @Bev Daniels kkkkkkkk
1596010687582333,42:53,Mbuso Ndlovu,Zuma stole few millions in two terms. 50 BILLIONS is gone before Cyril finishes his first term 😁😁😁😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😁😁😂😂
1596010752585583,43:59,Bev Daniels,"@Mbuso, I would rather think that Ace is the one and his cronies that are trying to bring down Cyril. There are two groups within the ANC"
1596010799496085,44:46,Dominic Przybylski,Who in ANC does not steal?
1596010804547251,44:51,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Bev Daniels then let's allow Malema to lead us
1596010901887804,46:28,Anthony Ramasike,the name ANC only does not steal
1596010910336921,46:37,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Dominic Przybylski I think there is no one in this world who have clean hands
1596010948149039,47:13,Dominic Przybylski,@Mbuso Ndlovu I don't trust Gucci Revolutionaries.
1596010973012888,47:39,Mbuso Ndlovu,Chair is getting paid by an hour the more this nonsense last the bigger his pocket😁😂😁😂
1596011032586411,48:38,Eric Belle,may be hellen zille or patricia de lille would be right to lead this country

1596011081600458,49:27,Dominic Przybylski,Why can't we lead ourselves. Do adults really need someone else to tell them what to do?
1596011097264290,49:43,Thobela Wem,"would we ever see anyone getting charged and arrested from this, its been going on for sometime 😔"
1596011097659700,49:43,reggi,Wow Hellen Ziĺle to lead the country....thats a joke
1596011101948366,49:48,Daphne Van Diemen,ek hou net om na die saak te luister en hou hoe die chair alles hanteer
1596011135134109,50:22,Dominic Przybylski,I don't like Zille but she did rescue Cape Town.
1596011172417196,50:59,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Thobela Wem This commission is a waist of CASH
1596011217624420,51:43,reggi,ofcourse she would rescue CT im not surprised
1596011273450464,52:39,Dominic Przybylski,CT was fast slipping into ANC scenario of corruption and mismanagement before she took control.
1596011285612071,52:51,Val Speirs,Helen Zille for President
1596011295318764,53:02,Martin van der Breggen,"I am listening does not mean a “yes” - please answer the question, yes or no"
1596011329092698,53:35,Thobela Wem,"@Mbuso Ndlovu, i totally agree with you. all its done is talk talk and cross talk but no one is charged and arrested. in the meantime COVID-19 billion are being stolen 😔"
1596011340451612,53:47,Val Speirs,Out with the ANC CANCER
1596011408442115,54:56,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Val Speirs We need someone like Trumph
1596011430969927,55:17,Val Speirs,"I hope Covid - 19 takes out the ANC , it is the only way forward"
1596011463140691,55:49,reggi,The country would be a proper Animal Farm.....her twèets are a depiction of that.
1596011493534119,56:18,Val Speirs,I am patriot of Trumps. At least he puts people first and creates jobs .
1596011506578088,56:32,kim polly,The ANC must know they are on the way out of power ... looting is in full gear .. closing down sale
1596011515375864,56:40,bongani khumalo,Nami ake ningibize nizongibuza zonke lezinganekwane enibuzana Zona lapho
1596011546693309,57:13,Val Speirs,ANC are on their way out just wait till the Virus gets them.
1596011572885276,57:39,Dominic Przybylski,People confuse being politically correct with being an effective leader. A politically correct person doesn't have the guts to be unpopular so cannot be a real leader.
1596011592877976,57:59,Easy D,"Oh the antic of this witness, is really creative ... wasn't it cold yesterday.... now breathing directly into the mic.....:elbowcough:"
1596011614710844,58:21,reggi,Then who is in if they are on their way out?
1596011621143192,58:27,Alvino Theunissen,I wont mind a Trump here as President he wont accept any theft and or corruption create employment.
1596011632733938,58:39,Peet Venter,"Chair, you're the one wasting time with your chit-chat"
1596011661622067,59:07,Martin van der Breggen,It’s cold
1596011674294307,59:20,adrian albertyn,They have not paid the heating account.
1596011686433976,59:32,Martin van der Breggen,Only when you are in the HOT SEAT
1596011692571012,59:38,Dominic Przybylski,This small talk is such a waste of time.
1596011713717729,1:00:00,Alvino Theunissen,@Peet Venter -agree only hard when he want to hurry up the Evidence lead.
1596011753224900,1:00:38,kim polly,anyone would be better
1596011779620724,1:01:06,Easy D,Oh he attended yesterday ... why didn't he prepare for today... always excuses... he want to stop ..the questions...LOL...
1596011786492506,1:01:12,Mohamed Mia,Infrastructure old what do you expect . Don’t act stupid everything is screwed up in this freaking country
1596011846469231,1:02:12,Dominic Przybylski,Why waste electricity when it's very easy to wear a jersey at no cost.
1596011854835513,1:02:21,jones noah Banda,If one minister or two can go to jail I think it will make a difference
1596011909564684,1:03:15,Mohamed Mia,Simpler English don’t act dumb
1596012053061531,1:05:39,Easy D,Yes i agree.. all criminals should/must be prosecuted @jones noah Banda..
1596012068778821,1:05:55,Mohamed Mia,Cough cough cough
1596012068962586,1:05:55,Maxwell Muza,too academic for simple questions
1596012224610110,1:08:31,adrian albertyn,I am going for a walk I had enough of this nonsense.
1596012269244950,1:09:14,kim polly,smoke break
1596012285016143,1:09:31,Mohamed Mia,Pee break

1596012305616665,1:09:51,katlego wasp,oh... i was about to smash my router

1596012320722264,1:10:07,katlego wasp,and nou??
1596012329587769,1:10:15,B H,Former minister Nhleko is using delay tactics to stall the questioning in an effort to have more time to think about his answers.
1596012334610167,1:10:21,Ntokozo Mkhize,mute🤷🏾‍♂️
1596012361444752,1:10:47,Michael Moeketsi Sello,What’s going on guys
1596012385389854,1:11:12,itumeleng angelinna,tea break
1596012412376142,1:11:38,Dominic Przybylski,Corruption consumes wealth without replacing it. Ultimate effect of corruption is destitution. Those with wealth will leave. Those without it will starve to death.
1596012430252632,1:11:56,Andrew Chipakata,volume is not there
1596012475234119,1:12:42,Abel Matshidiso,did mr. fire pool ask for tea break again
1596012485365653,1:12:50,Andrew Chipakata,please when resume let there be sound
1596012529069850,1:13:35,Easy D,Ok tea-break..well that make sense... I hope the witness don't start complaining of stomach pains.. next....:elbowcough:
1596012895404379,1:19:41,Martin van der Breggen,Zondo mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm sounds like a Hippo
1596012900936953,1:19:48,B H,"Commissions are different from court rooms in that the Chair, unlike a judge, is not there to force/compel the witness but to extract information."
1596013025786737,1:21:54,B H,Commission inquisitions are the most tedious and boring things. This is not a courtroom!!!
1596013033103675,1:21:59,Askar Niko02,like he crush one helicopte with 9 people death last year in usa sport black ( sorry for my call black becsuse i did not remember his name ) men death in helicopte

1596013614773307,1:31:41,Andre Marr,hello my fellow laggers
1596013764235251,1:34:11,Easy D,There're are protocols that must be followed.....
1596013799107697,1:34:45,Gerda 7,Are we busy with a lecture again?
1596013810554734,1:34:56,Alex Ngoy,This Bra knows exactly what he is doing by avoiding to answer questions
1596013839851353,1:35:26,Ishaad Mohammed,Morning All
1596013874326424,1:36:00,Bev Daniels,"@Alex, you are correct, he is trying to try and bamboozle them with his answers, but they are too wake up for that. He likes to try and stumble on everything."
1596013892959532,1:36:19,Bev Daniels,"He says there are rules and regulations in government, but he DID NOT FOLLOW THEM that is the whole issue"
1596013903040984,1:36:29,Ishaad Mohammed,Are we still on about the 2 reports 🙆
1596013910534042,1:36:37,Ben Fraser,But he received the later report before the fist report.
1596013912037854,1:36:38,B H,Gerda 7 Welcome to commission inquiries. That's what they often do because they trying to establish clarity around an issue.
1596013915907995,1:36:42,Bev Daniels,"Morning Ishaad, yes"
1596013991564948,1:37:58,Easy D,A witness definition of a report... really this is babble...
1596014055905231,1:39:03,Ben Fraser,He is leading the commission of enquiry.
1596014070495794,1:39:16,Roy Kisten,this guy should be a headmaster
1596014091545940,1:39:37,David Tuer,DCJ seems to continually interrupt Hulley's line of questioning while allowing the witness to wax long on all kinds of sideroads.
1596014131213178,1:40:18,Dominic Przybylski,@David Tuer Agreed.
1596014141704135,1:40:28,Bev Daniels,Mr Nhleko holds a Diploma in labour law from the Graduate Institute of Management and Technology.
1596014185646603,1:41:11,Easy D,I think the only way you can ever get a straight answer from this guy.. is by water-boarding...😆😆
1596014187779680,1:41:14,reggi,m
1596014241859180,1:42:08,reggi,.
1596014280733789,1:42:46,Alex Ngoy,This is not the same Bra who told South Africans that Nkandla needed more money to finish the work????
1596014287836533,1:42:55,Dominic Przybylski,Zondo is trying to get Nhleko to admit that he possesses at least a small vestige of common sense.
1596014322008840,1:43:28,Easy D,and a bit of integrity...
1596014330659736,1:43:38,B H,"Exactly Mr. Chair, the 2nd report would logically replace the 1st."
1596014371025646,1:44:17,Dominic Przybylski,Actually cannot have much common sense if he considered a fancy swimming pool to be a security feature.
1596014372994526,1:44:19,Martin van der Breggen,stupidity is also obviously an answer
1596014393172294,1:44:39,David Tuer,Dominic- he's not trying very hard.
1596014401310997,1:44:47,Michelle Wright,I can’t even🙄🙄
1596014426056507,1:45:12,B H,Mr. Nhleko is giggling because he realizes he's painted himself into a corner.
1596014442351276,1:45:27,Kevin Simon,"Yes, but did you see the size of the pool pump?🤣"
1596014511819129,1:46:38,Michelle Wright,Trying to look clever
1596014572893563,1:47:39,Kevin Simon,Trying to justify why he chose the report that suited his perspective. Surely faced with the conflicting findings as well as the timing from March to Dec he should have delved deeper.
1596014580616003,1:47:46,Gugulethu Xhosans,uyaxoka Nhleko. He also assumed that the first report could be the correct one because it serves his agenda.
1596014614352469,1:48:20,Dominic Przybylski,"To obtain ""absolute clarity"" surely the first step is to ask the people who produced the report to clarify??"
1596014641167236,1:48:47,R hunter,Ha ha talking himself into a corner. He keeps explaining the processes but clearly didn't follow them as he so elegantly states...
1596014656028111,1:49:01,Ivan vries,i thought these arrogant firepool minister is has finished his testimony yeasterday
1596014664692960,1:49:11,B H,"Mr. Nhleko is speaking in abstract terms about ""possibilities"" that could arise in organizational structures. He's not clarifying the position he took when presented with the 2 reports. He's delaying"
1596014681066400,1:49:25,Bruce Thackwell,mentally bankrupt trough feeder never trust a overweight politician
1596014710086543,1:49:56,Ivan vries,the man said he is even beter then laywers but just listen how he corner himself
1596014740381913,1:50:26,Martin van der Breggen,ask no questions and tell no lies.........here comes the cough........so we will need to take a 3 week break so he can consult with his master JZ
1596014741997107,1:50:28,David Tuer,Sounds like a Grade7 school debate.
1596014746639152,1:50:32,Gerda 7,Ivan Vries👍
1596014753071423,1:50:39,B H,Mr. Nhleko STOP TALKING!!!!!!!!!
1596014834281337,1:52:01,Dominic Przybylski,New application of Stalingrad tactics. He'll just carry on talking until he dies of old age.
1596014845181286,1:52:11,Mohamed Mia,This guy such a bs
1596014852884625,1:52:19,Michelle Wright,They are both excruciatingly boring
1596014875884463,1:52:40,Kevin Simon,If this guy was my subordinate I would have charged him with dereliction of duty. He took a decision without considered all the facts at his disposal.
1596014881163148,1:52:46,Mohamed Mia,Cough cough and
1596014905449253,1:53:12,Dominic Przybylski,Come on Zondo. Control you witness. Don't let him control you.
1596014915332787,1:53:21,Gerda 7,This is the 3rd point that hes trying to explain for half an hour .He cannot answer one question straight!!
1596014918925217,1:53:26,Gugulethu Xhosans,Nhleko is obfuscating
1596014929061579,1:53:35,Martin van der Breggen,"@dominic, I agree wholeheraredly"
1596014976065433,1:54:21,Hamarang 3D هەمەڕەنگ,😘😘
1596014978917170,1:54:24,Hamarang 3D هەمەڕەنگ,😍😍😍

1596015020749802,1:55:07,Michelle Wright,I find it very concerning that they can be laughing about this. Seriously
1596015123138903,1:56:49,gaxaza,This is just a waste of time and money
1596015172465184,1:57:38,Bruce Thackwell,"he thinks he is a practitioner of governance! Holy man of governance, saint who is above logic and common sense. Well done South Africa for voting these people into government.."
1596015178307438,1:57:43,David Tuer,I'm amazed Hulley can remember where he was before the debate over nothing started.
1596015219781417,1:58:25,Gerda 7,Davd Tuer 🤣😂
1596015229465210,1:58:36,Dominic Przybylski,He is still not answering the question.
1596015255023205,1:59:01,Gugulethu Xhosans,@Michelle Wright I would guess they wanted to channel him into his illusional world of lame sarcasm. You would have seen Nhleko's stinking attitudinal approach
1596015318982969,2:00:06,Kevin,I wonder what was this guys salary per month and all the perks ? How can he have had the necessary competence to fill that post.
1596015334709972,2:00:20,Dominic Przybylski,The answer is obviously NO.
1596015365712518,2:00:51,Kevin,It's obvious it was substantial...he is very well fed.
1596015379064042,2:01:06,Gugulethu Xhosans,"@Michelle Wright I guess he does not want to give him grounds to say the process is /was unfair to him, therefore he does not want answer questions."
1596015414648860,2:01:41,Michelle Wright,I think so @Guglethu Xhosans
1596015430174004,2:01:56,Martin van der Breggen,there is a HUGE difference between an SOP and a LAW.........
1596015442879642,2:02:08,B H,@Margaret Waterboer...THANK YOU!!!!:dothefive:
1596015460306881,2:02:27,Val Speirs,"I thought this Witness was meant to take a short period of time but he is playing games with the Commission. Time for Zondo and Counsel to take control and put questions that requires "" Yes"" or ""No""."
1596015471047115,2:02:37,Easy D,Exactly ... this action is known as gross misconduct and is a criminal offence.... now stop using these hypothetical scenarios .... to hide your incompetence..it's pathetic...
1596015472452202,2:02:39,Kevin,@Margareth Waterboer .....Trump learned his tricks from our government....we are world leaders in corruption
1596015538740067,2:03:45,Ettiene Meyer,if you are not educated and have experience you will see policies only as guidelines to suit your agenda!
1596015550481168,2:03:57,Kevin,If this goes to trial he will be lambasted ...
1596015550926717,2:03:58,Bruce Thackwell,Trump for president
1596015573658939,2:04:20,Val Speirs,Rubbish . Trump is no COMPARISON to ANC. You watch too much of the Corrupt News Network ..CNN
1596015604333478,2:04:51,Easy D,Also that's when my cat gave birth to 6 kittens... and the my Koi-fish arrived... really.....
1596015608521354,2:04:57,Val Speirs,If Trump was our President our economy would be booming.
1596015635596039,2:05:21,David Tuer,Where does Trump figure here? Try to focus.!
1596015635956273,2:05:21,B H,"@Val Speirs a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer is not in the terms of reference for this commission inquiry. This is not a court room madam."
1596015655215687,2:05:41,Bruce Thackwell,South African Voters got what they deserved...this clown
1596015716871514,2:06:44,Bev Daniels,"True voters do not realize what they are voting for, but then want to complain re service delivery etc"
1596015718005663,2:06:45,Kevin Simon,Bruce. Yes as did the USA.🤣🤣🤣🤣
1596015760802538,2:07:28,Isaiah Gatjeni Mangalani Ndlovu,lets focus on state capture inquiry
1596015766600158,2:07:32,malcolm payne,stop indulging this slippery clown
1596015778552345,2:07:43,Pops Rampersad,"@val speirs, you are welcome to emigrate for thinking that the moron in the White House is an answer to our economy. He's on the back foot and come 3 Nov he will be booted out"
1596015784567191,2:07:51,Margareth Waterboer,@Kevin I agree with our situation. Trump was corrupt before he became leader.
1596015803256553,2:08:09,Alvino Theunissen,Agree @Val Speirs
1596015808567158,2:08:14,Isaiah Gatjeni Mangalani Ndlovu,"lets rather focus on what led Nhleko to be on that chat of state inquiry,,,,"
1596015849898428,2:08:55,Val Speirs,"Trump will win again, the Silent Majority will vote him in as they did in 2016.Take that ."
1596015874427051,2:09:20,Kevin,@Margareth Waterboer .... Well to be honest 90% of all world leaders are corrupt. Its just that they have the brains to cover it up and not be so greedy.
1596015883252190,2:09:29,bheki bekzin,State capture inquiry...Anyone ever found guilty? Anyone ever been arrested? or just a waste of money.
1596015910342582,2:09:57,Isaiah Gatjeni Mangalani Ndlovu,IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY
1596015930339251,2:10:17,Isaiah Gatjeni Mangalani Ndlovu,No one was ever found guilty
1596015939288508,2:10:26,Alvino Theunissen,The CNN fake news try promote the Democrate Agenda so many networks in US doing the same.
1596015940585093,2:10:27,Bruce Thackwell,"I see you support the USA democrats phew, im leaving, yes you must stick with your sinking ship cheers!"
1596015971691227,2:10:57,Kevin Simon,"In fact Val. 63 million is less than 65 million. So no silent majority, oops."
1596015974188743,2:11:00,Dominic Przybylski,@Val Speirs You may be right. The politically correct brigade have become so aggressive and intimidating that many probably lie in opinion polls.

1596016071740092,2:12:38,Val Speirs,Thanks to Zuma
1596016133174674,2:13:39,Martin van der Breggen,How did he ever become a Minister in the first place
1596016160511690,2:14:06,Gammid32,it all sounds very fire-poolish like reminds me of that day in parly...
1596016165543520,2:14:12,Dominic Przybylski,I feel sorry for Hulley. Zondo has turned him into a spectator.
1596016177263185,2:14:22,Roy Kisten,he says to Zondo Look
1596016209638238,2:14:56,Roy Kisten,look look look
1596016218839276,2:15:06,Dominic Przybylski,This man is speaking gibberish.
1596016220145584,2:15:07,Yoliswa Sukati,this guy is wasting our time... this will take years and tax payers money........
1596016246850118,2:15:32,Martin van der Breggen,agreeing with the Chair is disrespectful and should not be entertained
1596016246919360,2:15:32,ONKE MHLAHLO,@Roy Kisten lol at look
1596016255540095,2:15:41,David Tuer,Dominic- seems to me that there is some problem between Zondo and Hulley.
1596016275375137,2:16:01,Martin van der Breggen,"Sorry, disagreeing with Chairman"
1596016276420814,2:16:02,Gerda 7,This guy is enjoying the attention !!
1596016290047632,2:16:15,Gugulethu Xhosans,@Dominic Przbylski . I guess Zondo could see Nhleko has a stinking attitude towards him just to frustrate him.
1596016335547844,2:17:01,Dominic Przybylski,Zondo is encouraging Nhleko in his time wasting. Why?
1596016345103694,2:17:11,Yoliswa Sukati,he hasnt answered anything..
1596016352675637,2:17:19,malcolm payne,this idiocy! why is zondo allowing this stream of lies and drivel from the witness?
1596016364942624,2:17:31,Val Speirs,This Commission of Enquiry is all Smoke and Mirrows setup by the ANC to make people think they are actually doing something about their corruption.
1596016396868409,2:18:03,Sibusiso Zulu,"I am so worried about the answers given by Minister Nhleko and too much of examples he's giving, the man is so calm and pass the bark to others"
1596016397299360,2:18:03,Gerda 7,"N,P.D Narcissistic personality disorder."
1596016400610286,2:18:07,Kevin,Imagine if JZ and this dude sit down at a table with a few bottles of wine....eish 😂
1596016438771799,2:18:44,Dominic Przybylski,Only commission of inquiry which achieved an outcome was the Nugent commission.
1596016465101348,2:19:11,Dominic Przybylski,Nugent didn't allow time-wasting.
1596016480337257,2:19:27,Sibusiso Zulu,adv Mokhari interject quit often!!!!!
1596016491436666,2:19:37,Pops Rampersad,"@Val Spiers, wake up and smell the coffee"
1596016513047173,2:19:59,ONKE MHLAHLO,DPC Zondo ' Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
1596016523505272,2:20:08,Dominic Przybylski,Zondo you have been wasting time and waffling. You are responsible.
1596016543865095,2:20:30,Val Speirs,I have had many cups of coffee and I am very alert .
1596016548288487,2:20:34,B H,Nathi Nhleko is smart at deflection and expending times allocated.
1596016568881411,2:20:57,Pops Rampersad,"@Val, then you are delusional"
1596016612271806,2:21:38,ONKE MHLAHLO,@Dominic Przybylski yes while he is very smart though
1596016622123036,2:21:48,Val Speirs,Pops... dont be a dork
1596016641556689,2:22:07,David Tuer,"Val-- Listening to this load of tripe, a couple or three whiskeys would be preferable."
1596016673158652,2:22:39,Val Speirs,Absolutely
1596016680250552,2:22:45,Sebastian MoAfrika,the sarcasm of lawyers!
1596016691569815,2:22:58,Martin van der Breggen,1.5 hours if we don't need to listen to Nhlekos duck and dive
1596016701731227,2:23:07,Dominic Przybylski,Hour and a half if the chairperson doesn't intentionally waste time.
1596016705057406,2:23:11,Pops Rampersad,"@Val Spiers, you are actually referring to yourself because that's what all Trump supporter are"
1596016743588637,2:23:50,Sibusiso Zulu,2 hours due to delaying tactics of Nhleko or even more than that
1596016766360253,2:24:12,Gerda 7,Another day will be enough for them.
1596016774527951,2:24:21,Dominic Przybylski,Zondo has been delaying with Nhleko.
1596016806852814,2:24:52,David Tuer,Sibusio-- It was supposed to finish before lunch yesterday.
1596016815285181,2:25:01,ONKE MHLAHLO,DJC Zondo keeps on having those rooaaaaaarr moments like a lion he is lol hahahahhaha love him so polite
1596016817264166,2:25:02,Val Speirs,Must move on to the next Witness this one is not cooperative .
1596016860251881,2:25:48,Val Speirs,Witness telling the Commission what to do
1596016891308124,2:26:17,David Tuer,This witness is now deciding how long the commission must sit!!!!
1596016896179764,2:26:21,Dominic Przybylski,I am now suspicious of Zondo. I don't understand why he has been and still is wasting so much time.
1596016898451382,2:26:23,Gerda 7,Shut up and move on with it!!
1596016901264596,2:26:27,ONKE MHLAHLO,@Val Speirs lol he is used to dedicator-ship
1596016923449358,2:26:49,Val Speirs,Yes
1596016969952417,2:27:36,Lebonetse Cyprian,"he thinks that he can command anywhere,"

1596016992437041,2:27:57,Dominic Przybylski,"This man is addicted to tea-breaks, lunch-breaks, starting late, finishing early..."
1596017021382408,2:28:28,Easy D,The witness gave long distracting scenarios deliberately... avoiding answering the questions...
1596017056119913,2:29:01,Gerda 7,No lunch break and go on till 6pm... that will be enough time for them.
1596017108402414,2:29:55,reggi,The calm that is Harley....
1596017115081436,2:30:01,Gugulethu Xhosans,@Dominic Przybylski . Hayi suka you have a vendetta against Zondo. This is not a court of law nor criminal matter for that matter.
1596017150701779,2:30:37,Dominic Przybylski,@Gugulethu Xhosans I don't like it when people waste time.
1596017167948165,2:30:53,Gerda 7,Answer the bloody question!!
1596017195670680,2:31:22,Eric Belle,unyanisile Gugu
1596017206963526,2:31:33,Gerda 7,Dominic👍
1596017287005438,2:32:53,Sibusiso Zulu,"how was even the""minister""been appointed to head sich ministry if he can't even understand the functions of saps components!!!! political appointees sometimes are problematic"
1596017292323841,2:32:58,B H,THANK YOU MR NHLEKO! Finally answering a question. That is the point. Crime intelligence cannot investigate itself because it's wrong!
1596017325240687,2:33:31,Val Speirs,Hubert..that is why I say it is all Smoke and Mirrors.
1596017419707628,2:35:06,Gugulethu Xhosans,@Dominic of cause time will be wasted because this not a court of law. Understanding that to make excuses that they are sick for example would not put them in jail. Therefore Zondo wants to be fair .
1596017512470077,2:36:38,David Tuer,Fair is not the right word. Try complicit.
1596017534562624,2:37:00,Craven Morehead,Moving at a snails pace as per usual
1596017551698244,2:37:17,Dominic Przybylski,@Gugulethu Xhosans I have been a fan of Zondo for a while but this is taking far too long at huge expense. We need to see results. Two years and not a single interim report allowing corrective action.
1596017648998951,2:38:55,Kevin,It is this dudes opportunity to clear the allegations made against him...he has not done that so give him more rope. This is what JZ is allowing him to do without actually saying it.
1596017734411264,2:40:21,Godfrey Mama,This is a commission of inquiry not a court or kangaroo court.
1596017757579285,2:40:43,David Tuer,"Dominic--I too have been impressed by Zondo, at least I was impressed. His performance here and with Zuma and Zuma's son is making me reconsider."
1596017868371979,2:42:35,Martin van der Breggen,"can this FOOL just say yes or no, he has not done so yet, its either look or i""m hearing you, what answer is this"
1596018009695605,2:44:55,Godfrey Mama,At the end Zondo might recommend criminally to be charge implicated persons and negligent individuals.
1596018070312268,2:45:56,Dominic Przybylski,This is excruciating.
1596018124980259,2:46:50,Pat Kingsley,Ponderous and clumsy. Where is Kate?
1596018145445548,2:47:12,Schalk Van Der Merwe,How do you make the biggest financial scandal in the history of South Africa so boring? Not that anythig is going to come out of this apart from another 7% pay increase for ANC members
1596018174592836,2:47:40,Roy Kisten,this guy got Zondo commission under his finger tips
1596018196138442,2:48:02,Ania Teo,Mr firepool. He can spin any crap to deflect.
1596018292204648,2:49:38,Pops Rampersad,indeed @Godfrey. in fact PROCLAMATION NO. R. 24 OF 2020 allows the the HAWKS & NPA to immediately commence with investigations and prosecutions
1596018380173652,2:51:06,Roy Kisten,but why is Zondo giving this guy so much leeway
1596018383857199,2:51:10,Dominic Przybylski,"""I'm also on the one had... blah de blah..."" ""and yesterday I have made an allegation you have stolen a goat.."" Come on Zondo control your witness."
1596018397833345,2:51:22,Easy D,Yes ... Judge slowly lead him into the pit..... clearly he was crap at his job....
1596018449922757,2:52:16,Easy D,Ah who's now asking the questions...??????
1596018470079437,2:52:36,Dominic Przybylski,about time Zondo
1596018522340669,2:53:28,MIKE DURBAN,Geeeeez....this Nathi fella is really running the show hey....
1596018541362540,2:53:47,Alvino Theunissen,He want to divert by saying its a cultural issue!
1596018552667420,2:53:56,makhosi nobhatyi,I think Zondo is waiting for him at the end
1596018559621343,2:54:05,mandla nkosi,So he must just yes I was instructing him....
1596018572970633,2:54:18,Arian Bester,This guy thinks he is untouchable
1596018601549487,2:54:47,Roy Kisten,cracking jokes aswell
1596018628390954,2:55:14,Barbara Sattler,It becomes uncomfortable when you have to lie.
1596018634830301,2:55:20,MIKE DURBAN,The CJ is entertaining Nathi fella way too much......geeeez
1596018640869191,2:55:28,Alvino Theunissen,Agree Arian
1596018686888172,2:56:13,MIKE DURBAN,Soory to say....but the CJ must catch a wake up......
1596018798786375,2:58:05,Mduduzi Thabede,I think judge Nugent would have sorted out this fellow jeer!!!
1596018824292609,2:58:30,David Tuer,DCJ asks a question and then gives the answer too!!!
1596018836639981,2:58:43,Roy Kisten,this guy should apply for a headmaster job
1596018855165309,2:59:00,Thozamile Yapi,"He is manipulating them! every time things seem to get tense, he cracks a joke to soften the DCJ🤔"
1596018861828884,2:59:07,Alvino Theunissen,David Tuer- hehehe
1596018865836581,2:59:11,David Tuer,ROY--Which one?
1596018897902507,2:59:43,MIKE DURBAN,Zondo is allowing this Bra to run the show....very frustrating......
1596018898972497,2:59:44,Roy Kisten,this police commissioner
1596018905132915,2:59:51,Mduduzi Thabede,"In essence he doesn’t want to answer this question, just move on and hammer him in your findings"
1596018906291131,2:59:52,Alvino Theunissen,@Thozamile Yapi - The chair allowing the diversion!
1596018931788655,3:00:18,Arthur Dell,"His verbal diareha is worse that Covid 19, it kills me!!!!"
1596018936053504,3:00:22,MIKE DURBAN,The untouchable police minister it seems......
1596018963000655,3:00:49,Kevin,JZ is actually being sneaky..he asks him same questions but in another way and also answers his question. Then the idiot disagrees and spins another story...He is contradicting himself poor fool.
1596019022720811,3:01:49,Derek Auret,Is this a Commission of Enquiry or a comfortable fire-side chat?
1596019024393971,3:01:50,MIKE DURBAN,@Kevin ...Geeez...true...but very frustrating etc...
1596019066765081,3:02:32,Samuel Skosana,Judge Nugent should have conducted this interview
1596019079425687,3:02:45,Kevin,@MIKE DURBAN ....its part of the plan Mike..he is being set up and given rope. It is tedious but necessary.
1596019135969130,3:03:40,holeng masemola,i cant seem to get the story line behind this gentlemen here
1596019147736581,3:03:55,MIKE DURBAN,@Kevin .....Man....as long as all this goes to the law courts etc etc.......
1596019183184499,3:04:29,Kevin,@holeng masemola .... nor does the witness know the story line....it changes 😂
1596019190692964,3:04:36,Godfrey Mama,"I also like judge Nugent old dispensation and Zondo new order, indirectly smiling with you but putting you in deep trouble."
1596019197534372,3:04:43,Easy D,he just can't follow procedures..... even now... he's panicking guys....
1596019214670019,3:05:00,Hilton Walbrugh,"what was planned for one day, has become this marathon because this witness knows how to answer yes/no in very long waffle, and then does not answer the question."
1596019301658984,3:06:27,Roy Kisten,delaying tactics
1596019321148826,3:06:47,Sfiso Zondi,"@Hilton, agreed, the witness is totally defensive in his approach. He has a lot to hide"
