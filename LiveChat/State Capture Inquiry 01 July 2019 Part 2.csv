1561982709842880,-1:00,Ndimphiwe Gushu,I hope the technical issues are fixed on Part 2. Last session was filled with glitches & blackouts. Come on SABC.
1561983069265561,4:46,SHAFIQUE KHAN,.

1561983174938613,6:31,Ndimphiwe Gushu,How do you know it's a dress? @Wilhelm5381
1561983231027048,7:28,Dominic Przybylski,Nice to see someone who appears to be competent.
1561983235606653,7:33,Born free,It appears that Mama Dudu Myeni exceeded her fiduciary duties and was running SAA. Sky Chefs will win their law suit but it should be Myeni that's pays them from her very own purse.
1561983290713041,8:28,Dominic Przybylski,The abuse of BEE seems to follow a standard pattern.
1561983322579640,9:00,Born free,This witness is an honourable educated lady. Myeni certainly had all the loyalists removed.

1561983391960385,10:09,Disemi Molta,tendering should be abolished
1561983452446996,11:10,Derek Main,@Disemi Molta I agree it's flawed but what's the alternative.
1561983469315017,11:26,Born free,Tenders should not fall into the hands of the ANC
1561983498483912,11:57,Dominic Przybylski,"Nothing wrong with tendering. The problem is the people who use it in combination with ignorant ""beneficiaries"" who are confounded and manipulated."
1561983509483026,12:06,Joyful Technologies,"I totally agree with you,south Africa was destroyed by these shady tenders . Let them be abolished."
1561983537129487,12:35,Born free,"Yes the, ""peopke""= ANC"
1561983541811844,12:39,Disemi Molta,hiring more youth the better
1561983593080186,13:30,Disemi Molta,"tendering has lot of loopholes which create room for corruption. it was meant to uplift the poor of the poorest, but now viceversa"
1561983601033360,13:38,Born free,Tenders should be procured by qualified people who are not affiliated to any party.
1561983628983391,14:06,Derek Main,I think we need to get much tougher on corruption. Something to really put off the thieves - like the Chinese model of execution for corruption.
1561983658010513,14:35,Dominic Przybylski,Tender is standard procedure for all large contracts private or public sector. It is way to obtain quotes. Without tenders there can be no quotes. The problem is the PEOPLE who adjudicate
1561983661180227,14:38,Disemi Molta,"but the ruling party is not considerate of those qualified people, but takes those with ANC membership"
1561983675340492,14:52,Born free,Bring back the death penalty
1561983686103863,15:03,Disemi Molta,once and for all
1561983687739511,15:04,Ibo Thabo,@Disemi Molta Thank you so much
1561983714800813,15:32,Derek Main,"I'm not really a fan of the death penalty but for corruption, I'll make an exception."
1561983741232105,15:58,Disemi Molta,more money which was supposed to create job is channeled to commissions after commission with no prosecution
1561983759332887,16:16,Dominic Przybylski,"""Radical Transformation"" is the excuse for corruption."
1561983786235885,16:43,Disemi Molta,what is the role of vetting then?
1561983826218907,17:23,KQ-O’ American Lady,This was already on? Not live
1561983830585820,17:28,Magda Seguin,No sound
1561983869310313,18:06,Dominic Przybylski,All SOE procurement is politically skewed.
1561983879696937,18:17,Derek Main,@Born free That's not a bad idea - an independent company deciding on all government tenders so there can be no conflicts of interest.
1561983881155813,18:19,Disemi Molta,of course
1561983883899685,18:21,Born free,The government can carry on with transformation in the government but must leave the private sector alone.
1561983893815562,18:31,Magda Seguin,SABC Digital sound please
1561983901278406,18:38,Disemi Molta,centralise tender process rather
1561983998675634,20:15,Dominic Przybylski,"Government has run out of money and doesn't pay on time anyway so who wants to do business with them, even if they are black owned companies?"
1561984041858780,20:59,Robert Russell,@Derek Main .... there is a wealth of retired acumen in our society.... run pre-awarded tenders past them to see if there is value for money..... before the final awards
1561984071006645,21:27,Born free,This government has destroyed many private companies and small to medium businesses
1561984090110345,21:47,Kapn Krunch,they will never leave the private sector alone without us they have no money
1561984114812316,22:12,Disemi Molta,"more money is wasted on investigations and investigations, comissions with no actions, ho thusang!"
1561984121363078,22:18,gavin dw,It seems like this miss quinana has some questions to answer
1561984122202346,22:19,Kapn Krunch,they are communists they dont understand business they just want its money
1561984159459720,22:57,Dominic Przybylski,@Kapn Krunch That's the gist of it.
1561984165497933,23:03,Derek Main,@Disemi Molta Tend to agree with you. Just look at the farce of an Arms Deal inquiry. It would be funny if it weren't so sad.
1561984213649167,23:51,Kapn Krunch,look at ramaphosa a supposed business man announcing land expropriation without compensation with no plan on how they will do it giving investors cold feet the man doesn't understand business if he
1561984220007834,23:57,Thami Ngwenya,China is a communist country and no2 in the world monopoly
1561984224710402,24:03,Kapn Krunch,did he wouldn't have done it like that
1561984230622523,24:07,Disemi Molta,"Derek, we are waiting to get the results next month about zuma, but case may go on, we eat him peace by peace until we lock him up when he is peniles"
1561984269874783,24:47,Bernard Matolino,@Kapn Krunch You are misrepresenting Cyril Ramaphosa for your own propagandistic end
1561984289231967,25:06,Kapn Krunch,am I wrong?
1561984316436487,25:34,Dominic Przybylski,Lot of skeletons in Ramaphosa's closet. How did he become a billionaire simply by being a token BEE non-executive board member in a bunch of companies?
1561984318721263,25:36,Derek Main,Disemi - I'm with you all the way on that one but Zupta is a wily fox. My cynical side says he will get away with it. Either he will claim unfair it's taken so long or old age.
1561984324772657,25:43,Kapn Krunch,what sort of business man does such a thing he didnt even reassure them and as a result we hit junk status shortly after
1561984330899751,25:48,Disemi Molta,"one issue brings other issues, its not wrong to talk about rotten potatoes in the same bag"
1561984338359848,25:55,Bernard Matolino,@Pastor JJ You are right. It is wrong to misrepresent a President
1561984344534116,26:01,Kapn Krunch,cause and affect
1561984364051322,26:21,Yolo More,Luvo Makasi
1561984370268581,26:27,carnoth ngomane,"@Kapn Krunch yes you are wrong, for it is not CR's decision rather the ANC as a collective"
1561984396624707,26:54,Neville Watson,All Zuma fault
1561984412338175,27:10,Kapn Krunch,was just saying
1561984413257518,27:10,Disemi Molta,true
1561984421955842,27:19,carnoth ngomane,@Thando Nkutha you really hate these essays lol
1561984435268100,27:32,Born free,Where did Ramaphosa acquire the money to Invest in mining and buy all the McDonald Franchises??
1561984443046662,27:40,Derek Main,@Pastor JJ I think these are discussions that need to be had. There are few other areas where we SAfns can engage.
1561984474917156,28:12,Ibo Thabo,since Zuma hijacked the country via hijacking the ANC nearly everyone particularly his followers feel bold to copy him
1561984501899752,28:39,carnoth ngomane,@Thando Nkutha you like it short and sweet
1561984505080970,28:42,Yolo More,These essays murders our eye appetite😋😋😋
1561984513856077,28:50,Dominic Przybylski,"PP vs CR is likely to be very interesting, perhaps shocking."
1561984574008115,29:51,Cerebis,CR was no 2 in the ANC Collective.....All ANC office bearers are on trail in this commision
1561984576916396,29:54,Derek Main,@Pastor JJ I would argue they are largely essential debates. I like hearing the views of other SAfns of the issues confronting us.
1561984588467508,30:06,Wilson Hishono,this leader of evidence also ...seems to be in need of guidance too
1561984626525162,30:44,Dominic Przybylski,Leader of evidence is annoying. Is she a qualified lawyer?
1561984648173004,31:05,Wilson Hishono,if it was Ms hofmeyer shes just sharp ukuthi...
1561984670473566,31:27,Yolo More,Is it gonna be a full day? Buthelezi is for half days testimony.
1561984681942371,31:39,Wilson Hishono,this one is not applying any analysis
1561984690721617,31:48,Disemi Molta,from the 9-15 is zuma
1561984693581296,31:50,makhosi nobhatyi,I don’t worry that much about PP’s findings negative or not negative we will deal with it no problem
1561984699274139,31:56,Born free,It's interesting to learn that Madam Myeni was also the Chairperson of Fly Chefs . Where she would have profited no doubt.
1561984729193650,32:26,Jayden Bango,very difficult to follow at what stage we are in this testimony.....we are being robbed of entertainkment
1561984744352117,32:41,Derek Main,"@Pastor JJ You know where the block button is - if you don't like seeing what I'm saying, use it."
1561984748432099,32:46,clive oconnell,All other leaders are working on 🚿Zuma emails
1561984769743472,33:07,makhosi nobhatyi,Next SABC
1561984775055341,33:12,Wilson Hishono,Ms Myeni is a mastermind or KINGPIN or architect with no signature ...
1561984776756967,33:14,Dominic Przybylski,@makhosi nobhatyi Depends whether money laundering is involved and the extent of it.
1561984839277289,34:17,Yolo More,I miss Maleka and Norman tjooo!
1561984848677025,34:26,Lorna Kavanagh,you cannot pay a third party...
1561984849038935,34:26,Wilson Hishono,Shes not guilty because she did not sign any thing and everything at this point are but just allegations
1561984864920326,34:42,Jayden Bango,@makhosi nobhatyi when?
1561984870798128,34:48,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Dominic Przybylski there was no money laundering there, She can do that but court will prove her wrong"
1561984902090510,35:19,Lorna Kavanagh,saa made a fundamental error paying a third party.
1561984916501353,35:34,Dominic Przybylski,@makhosi nobhatyi I hope so. If CR is proved to be a crook we are in huge trouble.
1561984938788924,35:56,makhosi nobhatyi,@Jayden Bango we are waiting this weekend or next weekend
1561984940031873,35:57,Derek Main,@Pastor JJ Like I said - block me.
1561984942222520,35:59,Norman Zwane,@Wilson Hishono Dudu Myeni was not pulling the strings. I think the Guptas were and Zuma was using Dudu (his concubine ) as an enforcer. It is scary when you see how people were bullied into stuff.
1561984964756681,36:22,Born free,SAA made a fundamental error appointing Madam Myeni
1561984972806371,36:30,Jayden Bango,@makhosi nobhatyi cant wait for hlaudi and faith
1561985010278015,37:07,Yolo More,"Pastor JJ, hayi marn. The Bible says okungathandwa ngumzalwane wakho kuyeke. We as your fellow brothers, don't like your essays.😊😊"
1561985039691220,37:37,makhosi nobhatyi,@Dominic Przybylski you need to understand she enters political space so she is serving particular faction
1561985047929332,37:45,Dominic Przybylski,"Zuma appointed Myeni @Born free, and anyone who tried to get her under control was fired including ministers."
1561985110496637,38:48,Born free,Yes thanks @Dominique.. I was wondering about that.
1561985114254426,38:51,Disemi Molta,Malema reprimanded SA in 2011 about the Guptas and the apoointment of ministers
1561985122447677,39:00,Norman Zwane,@Dominic Przybylski @makhosi nobhatyi Sadly I think CR is not clean and as such JGZ will ensure he is unmasked so they all go down. I think we will soon be looking a new Prezza.
1561985138234018,39:15,Dominic Przybylski,"@makhosi nobhatyi regardless of faction if the evidence of fraud, money laundering, racketeering is there then we only have crooks to govern our country."
1561985211921297,40:29,Magda Seguin,Zuma mentioning names? No sane person will believe a word he says
1561985221492619,40:39,Derek Main,@Disemi Molta I think JZ will find some excuse not to testify.
1561985221865412,40:39,Thami Ngwenya,"Money laundering does not form part of PP. iT IS A SEROUS CRIME, PPspokeperson confirms"
1561985229755549,40:47,Dominic Przybylski,Cadre deployment and BEE has virtually guaranteed that anyone involved will have acted without integrity.
1561985231570808,40:49,Born free,Has the Government had to bail out SAA almost every year since Myeni was appointed??
1561985247695620,41:05,KQ-O’ American Lady,Oh really
1561985266056859,41:23,Siya Dilimeni,uThuli yiDiva
1561985281221755,41:38,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Norman Zwane that won’t happen if it doesn’t there will no more ANC I promise you South Africa need a lead like CR but no space to operate because of the faction and Zuma
1561985291388750,41:49,Prudence Mokoena,mhhhhhh!!!
1561985293228637,41:51,Le MbembinO,Guys when is JZ testifying?
1561985305628913,42:03,Yolo More,"Preach mama Mpshe, preach."
1561985306361452,42:03,Disemi Molta,15 to 19 july
1561985314169672,42:11,Magda Seguin,15th to 19th July
1561985327582204,42:25,clive oconnell,Suicide would be my top reason for 🚿Zuma no show
1561985327811557,42:25,Norman Zwane,@Disemi Molta JGZ has already said he will pick and choose which questions he will answer. i think he will do his best to discredit the Commission and bog it down.He said this to students at UJ 27/6
1561985329384783,42:27,Jayden Bango,@Le MbembinO aint gonna happen
1561985333701152,42:31,Born free,So they could not have had their first gets on the pulse.. we know why now.
1561985350405321,42:47,Le MbembinO,Thank You guys
1561985356443503,42:54,Disemi Molta,"but he must be treated like others, must answer"
1561985379864592,43:17,KQ-O’ American Lady,What a lovely blazer
1561985404278645,43:42,Disemi Molta,there is no way zuma can duck all the evidence that is pointing to him
1561985428135494,44:05,Born free,Zuma will have to answer questions and not pick and choose. Judge Zondo will ensure this.
1561985433200422,44:10,Disemi Molta,maybe at the end we can have a clean governance
1561985455758291,44:33,Norman Zwane,"@makhosi nobhatyi I think the JGZ faction (Ace, Supra, Nomvula, Nosebenzi etc.) will do their best to bring CR through the PP down. I think they know some dirt on CR and is vulnerable. He is going."
1561985460839189,44:38,Yolo More,OUTA must also vome
1561985469141721,44:46,Yolo More,come
1561985478587801,44:56,Disemi Molta,I suspect so
1561985493015431,45:10,Born free,"Zuma is no longer the President, he is a citizen who is a criminal."
1561985518421917,45:35,Disemi Molta,and must be trated as such
1561985523619070,45:41,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I don't dispute he will go to commission but his lawyer will do all the talking. He'll find a way not to testify.
1561985541705067,45:58,Magda Seguin,"I took that plane twice from and to Dakar in Senegal,its exactly as she explains,it was eventually stopped"
1561985594240012,46:51,Disemi Molta,"If Zuma is not careful enough Nkandla will be forfeited by the state, maybe to be used as a university or old age home"
1561985632994062,47:30,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Norman Zwane you know crooks what they are doing trying intermediary CR in fighting this corruption but our president is smarter he is corporate until final they don’t have anything other than thi
1561985637745611,47:35,KQ-O’ American Lady,I knew someone who said there was an African buying up cars to ship to africa. This was in mid 2000’s Interesting she said that.
1561985665428953,48:02,Jayden Bango,speak up buthelezi man
1561985665629167,48:03,Magda Seguin,"The last time I went to Abidjan in Ivory Coast I took the SAA flight via Accra,her evidence is spot on"
1561985737438707,49:15,Magda Seguin,I dint fly SAA anymore
1561985741805101,49:20,Ibo Thabo,With all of these chaos & shambolic in such very important not just organ but symbol of the nation where was the NIA to alarm & advice the government and parliament?
1561985744310565,49:22,makhosi nobhatyi,One day they will fight amongst themselves over the money they steal from us
1561985746534628,49:24,KQ-O’ American Lady,See her infinity symbol on her blazer? is that a pin? or pattern?
1561985771426043,49:49,Dominic Przybylski,SAA is a scary airline.
1561985776670068,49:54,thewormzerjr,youtube has become propaganda mainstream media news
1561985804799936,50:22,clive oconnell,If 🚿Zuma brings all the family the courts not big enough
1561985832389480,50:49,Mike Meyer,this commission should remove adv buthelezi .... perhaps special leave of some sorts .
1561985835579175,50:52,makhosi nobhatyi,Now they are after Gordhan whom not stealing money and leave the corrupt comrade
1561985867771709,51:24,Dominic Przybylski,Problem with JZ is he doesn't understand difference between corruption and integrity.
1561985874054753,51:31,Jayden Bango,@Mike Meyer i second that. its just painful the way she is leading
1561985897457800,51:54,Magda Seguin,"I read that people are collecting money for Zuma supporters are coming to the commission,everything organised by Carl Niehaus and the MK vets"
1561985901346767,51:58,Francois Cape Town,@Mike Meyer How do you expect people to learn/gain experience?
1561985941395957,52:39,Jayden Bango,@Francois Cape Town other platforms not here.
1561985942291211,52:40,Magda Seguin,They even asked taxi associations to lower their fares for his supporters to attend
1561985955532410,52:53,Dominic Przybylski,@Francois Cape Town this is not a training ground.
1561985969342910,53:06,Yolo More,"Mike Meyer, I agree, but September and Molefe must go with her."
1561985983386079,53:20,clive oconnell,@Thando Nkutha you give her too much praise
1561985989064956,53:26,Mike Meyer,not on a forum like this @francois
1561986016560727,53:53,Kay Kay,"Magda Seguin, who's Carl Niehaus?"
1561986029095283,54:06,Born free,It's just that Ms Buthelezi does have this cry in her voice.. 🤣
1561986037822250,54:15,Francois Cape Town,"@Jayden Bango and then somebody on another platform complaining. You think Adv Hofmeyr was fluent in the start of her career? Give everyone a chance, even if it is not up to your rigid standards"
1561986047757302,54:25,Jayden Bango,looooool
1561986051996455,54:30,Derek Main,@Pastor JJ No problem. I'll try to stick to the script but it's difficult. 😎
1561986074557868,54:52,Siya Dilimeni,USEMNCINCI LOMNTANA FOR LENTO BAMFAKA KUYO OOTAT'UZONDO!
1561986096526159,55:14,Francois Cape Town,@Dominic Przybylski Exposure is training ground. We only learn through making mistakes
1561986107239023,55:24,MIKE DURBAN,Carl Niehaus.....happens to be a bitter and twisted Commie..

1561992485389307,2:41:42,Yolo More,Where is the evidence leader?😂😂😂 This is getting out of hand and the chair is enjoying it.😇😇
1561992504739765,2:42:01,Dominic Przybylski,Now I understand what radical transformation means: It means that government should act without any regard for the law.
1561992513183477,2:42:10,LYD online tv,The Judge is enjoying this Mgossy....
1561992523445124,2:42:21,Sihle Charlie Nxumalo,Evidence leader is incompetent

1561992563924024,2:43:01,Magda Seguin,😂😂😂😂
1561992589537308,2:43:26,Siya Dilimeni,Where is my Buthelezi
1561992593362965,2:43:30,Bernard Matolino,The judge must not listen to this with such keen interest. It is really like he is over enjoying it
1561992593957494,2:43:31,Sthakathi Khumalo,Why were they quite hehe
1561992598208459,2:43:35,mxolisi buthelezi,"@Noluthando Gosa hahahaha, I agree"
1561992614377163,2:43:52,Dominic Przybylski,Only 1361 people watching out of a population of 60 million.
1561992632819577,2:44:11,Yolo More,Lex Luger. This is first hand information. What do you mean it's rumour mongering. It is from the horse's mouth.
1561992649218030,2:44:26,Anne M.,"Yes, because data is expensive. If it were on TV more people would watch."
1561992651480849,2:44:28,Sthakathi Khumalo,Dominic Przybylski Its the economic disparities my brother
1561992665581933,2:44:42,Raymond Fitzgerald,the 60 million could not care less trying how to make monies out of SOES
1561992668543455,2:44:45,Jayden Bango,@Siya Dilimeni somewhere in the room
1561992670198110,2:44:47,Bernard Matolino,"@Dominic Przybylski thers are watching on TV, others are working, others will catch up later"

1561992711642804,2:45:29,LYD online tv,Kwinana was there for corruption. Nothing else!
1561992712339478,2:45:30,Bernard Matolino,"@Yolo More This is one sided, so far. You see, now the judge is asking the witness to speculate. That must not happen."
1561992716663907,2:45:33,Magda Seguin,"Very sad,most SAs are not even aware of the evidence here,they listen to populists and looters,just go on Twitter and see the ignoramuses supporting the EFF and ANC looters"
1561992725833977,2:45:42,Jayden Bango,this was one tense meeting
1561992759989457,2:46:17,Bernard Matolino,Every witness will tell the story to suit his or her side. Until they are cross-examined.
1561992760214863,2:46:17,Fred Botha,Not everyone can watch some off us are working
1561992785484835,2:46:43,Magda Seguin,"Tense is not the word,it was ultra bullying going on"
1561992824788380,2:47:22,Dominic Przybylski,My point is that it is only a politically insignificant minority who will have been exposed to this evidence.
1561992826685519,2:47:24,Raymond Fitzgerald,chair cannot believe what he is hearing

1561994782208388,3:19:59,Dominic Przybylski,"Apart from state capture, our unions have captured their industries. Is why our standard of education is so bad."
1561994783019981,3:20:00,Magda Seguin,The tripartite alliance is the worst thing that happened to SA
1561994803811379,3:20:21,MIKE DURBAN,they are a bunch of Commies/Socialists....true

1561994922318760,3:22:19,Dominic Przybylski,True. Karl Marx didn't forsee the establishment of unions. There were no unions in USSR.
1561994975442161,3:23:12,clive oconnell,Or China Cuba N Korea
1561994989717954,3:23:27,MIKE DURBAN,the commies area very clever SOB's.......we gotto be many steps ahead of them....

1561995281060418,3:28:18,Granny Mokwena,Myeni was planted at SAA
1561995325687480,3:29:02,Gareth Davies,ZUPTA is on record as saying that he doesn’t need “clever blacks”.

1561995551183002,3:32:48,MIKE DURBAN,To my mind.....it's either fight...or flight.....
1561995642560730,3:34:20,Jayden Bango,typical breakdown of a working relationship
1561995691653863,3:35:08,Magda Seguin,Could have been @ Raymond Fitzgerald...the SOE looters were always acting in accordance with Zuma and Gupta orders
1561995847028440,3:37:43,Magda Seguin,"Legalitiespolicies and procedures out the window,willing acolytes pit in positions to do the bidding etc etc...true Mafia"
1561995905032553,3:38:42,Magda Seguin,And so institutional knowledge was cast aside to make way for theft

1561999261768961,4:34:38,Moahi Hlapolosa,Some documents were not read into record in today’s evidence because of incompetence

1561999749807356,4:42:46,Dominic Przybylski,What chances for turnaround strategies and new boards and expensive new CEOs to actually succeed?
1561999779520201,4:43:17,Yolo More,So this Jarana was not that smart as is portrayed.
1561999822071156,4:43:59,Magda Seguin,"He had to finally admit that he is not the silver bullet that could turn SAA around,he resigned"
1561999855377005,4:44:32,Norman Zwane,@Dominic Przybylski They best be buying a few Quantums and start driving up and down the highways instead of trying to fly.Either that or all of us are up the creek!
1561999871419163,4:44:48,Dominic Przybylski,I don't think anybody can turn SOEs around within the current political context.
1561999905745595,4:45:23,Magda Seguin,I think Jarana was also influenced by the rotten apples that is still on the Board
1561999930776404,4:45:47,Alirio De Araujo,Why do you think he left in a hurry?
1561999939709450,4:45:56,Norman Zwane,@@Yolo More In seSwati lijaha is a young man but Lijahana is a small small young man- a boy in fact.
