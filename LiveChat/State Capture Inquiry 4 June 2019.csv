1559639830228422,1:16:27,Muriel Haynes,what a great witness let the truth be told
1559639845367239,1:16:42,Magda Seguin,"There are others who will attest to what he is saying,this commission is proof that statements are usually repeated by others in the same position"
1559639853508943,1:16:50,Nelson Musoliwa,Facts are did meetings 4 of them with zuma happened
1559639859026761,1:16:56,Mzalwane Mzala,@carnoth ngomane The judiciary proved to be the light in the dark days of a captured government

1559643022773396,2:09:40,Magda Seguin,It's terrible being made out to be a liar
1559643099829913,2:10:56,Magda Seguin,They must show their faces at the commission and stop writing affadavits to be read
1559643169235341,2:12:06,Magda Seguin,"Thank you Sir,let him come"
1559643226048771,2:13:03,Magda Seguin,They will say the cameras did not work...baskets
1559643303314914,2:14:20,Anne M.,"@lemmy mohale An innocent person would be at the commission demanding to be heard, not so?"
1559643307705610,2:14:24,Magda Seguin,They KNEW they were coming...jirre this is disgusting
1559643366987229,2:15:24,Magda Seguin,"I think forthwith nobody would want to whistleblower,especially after Agrizzi was arrested and also attacked this week without a peep from the Judge"
1559643403877051,2:16:00,Sophia Maholela,"@AnneM, yep, anybody is allowed"
1559643494682985,2:17:31,Magda Seguin,"Agrizzi was robbed and attacked at a garage last week,NOBODY commented,they told him : Stop talking"
1559643495767409,2:17:32,Takalani Luthada,whose statement is the advocate reading
1559643516144124,2:17:53,Anne M.,"@Magda Seguin I also think the whole Agrizzi hold up at the service station is iffy. A question that came to mind was, does he no longer have security."
1559643623072053,2:19:40,Magda Seguin,I am surprised at Judge Zondo's attitude towards the witness
1559643711345335,2:21:08,ACBN,The English on this thread is horrible.
1559643799438226,2:22:36,Anne M.,"I think the quotes which should have been ""my understanding"" yesterday caused some concern. I think Judge Zondo's listened more today."
1559643827246462,2:23:05,Anne M.,@Takalani Luthada Moegsien Williams
1559643829914118,2:23:08,Ben Cole,This witness stood his ground in spite of the necessary interrogation by Justice Zondo. He didn't waver at all. Was prepared to be cross examined. The Justice has a duty to clarify uncertainties.
