1559639500482604,1:10:58,Mzalwane Mzala,@carnoth ngomane Who are those individuals and what did they do?
1559639597847979,1:12:35,Anne M.,@Mzalwane Mzala Agree - we have a world class judiciary. There will always be a couple of bad apples in any large organisation.
1559639604341930,1:12:42,carnoth ngomane,@Mzalwane Mzala if you were following this commission you should know by now that our judiciary was also captured
1559639645053255,1:13:22,Mzalwane Mzala,@carnoth ngomane I have been following it. I hope you know that the NPA is not part of the judiciary
1559639664042985,1:13:41,Cerebis,"Gordhan was in charge of the treasury when some of the bad things like Arms Deal, Nkandla etc happened?"

1559639827016015,1:16:24,Zee Zondani,"his testimony has a lot of red flags, cant believe he did not get his act together today because zondo kept on asking him and going back to his word and the what he used in the book"
1559639830228422,1:16:27,Muriel Haynes,what a great witness let the truth be told
1559639845367239,1:16:42,Magda Seguin,"There are others who will attest to what he is saying,this commission is proof that statements are usually repeated by others in the same position"
1559639853508943,1:16:50,Nelson Musoliwa,Facts are did meetings 4 of them with zuma happened
1559639859026761,1:16:56,Mzalwane Mzala,@carnoth ngomane The judiciary proved to be the light in the dark days of a captured government

1559639976627745,1:18:53,Mzalwane Mzala,@carnoth ngomane I forgive you for thinking that the judiciary includes the prosecutors
1559639984998986,1:19:02,Magda Seguin,The lead advocate is brilliant
1559639998126862,1:19:15,Anne M.,@Cerebis My conspiracy theory - JZ's friends have paid spammers and set up bots to try and distract us from hearing what's going on.

1559643008751738,2:09:27,Solly 12,Magda Saguin I what u mean but I feel like there’s a lot of information we are not getting here
1559643022773396,2:09:40,Magda Seguin,It's terrible being made out to be a liar
1559643099829913,2:10:56,Magda Seguin,They must show their faces at the commission and stop writing affadavits to be read
1559643169235341,2:12:06,Magda Seguin,"Thank you Sir,let him come"
1559643226048771,2:13:03,Magda Seguin,They will say the cameras did not work...baskets
1559643303314914,2:14:20,Anne M.,"@lemmy mohale An innocent person would be at the commission demanding to be heard, not so?"
1559643307705610,2:14:24,Magda Seguin,They KNEW they were coming...jirre this is disgusting
1559643366987229,2:15:24,Magda Seguin,"I think forthwith nobody would want to whistleblower,especially after Agrizzi was arrested and also attacked this week without a peep from the Judge"
1559643403877051,2:16:00,Sophia Maholela,"@AnneM, yep, anybody is allowed"
1559643494682985,2:17:31,Magda Seguin,"Agrizzi was robbed and attacked at a garage last week,NOBODY commented,they told him : Stop talking"
1559643495767409,2:17:32,Takalani Luthada,whose statement is the advocate reading
1559643516144124,2:17:53,Anne M.,"@Magda Seguin I also think the whole Agrizzi hold up at the service station is iffy. A question that came to mind was, does he no longer have security."
1559643623072053,2:19:40,Magda Seguin,I am surprised at Judge Zondo's attitude towards the witness
1559643711345335,2:21:08,ACBN,The English on this thread is horrible.
1559643799438226,2:22:36,Anne M.,"I think the quotes which should have been ""my understanding"" yesterday caused some concern. I think Judge Zondo's listened more today."
1559643827246462,2:23:05,Anne M.,@Takalani Luthada Moegsien Williams
1559643829914118,2:23:08,Ben Cole,This witness stood his ground in spite of the necessary interrogation by Justice Zondo. He didn't waver at all. Was prepared to be cross examined. The Justice has a duty to clarify uncertainties.
1559643873328845,2:23:50,Lesedi,is this a man?😅😅😅

1559644018815544,2:26:15,Ben Cole,"Judge him on the content of his testimony, not his appearance. The next thing is that we'll dabate other prejudices."
1559644037183232,2:26:34,Magda Seguin,"@ACBN stop being snobbish,most people in SA di mot have English as their first language.BTW is it all you can add to the debate?"
