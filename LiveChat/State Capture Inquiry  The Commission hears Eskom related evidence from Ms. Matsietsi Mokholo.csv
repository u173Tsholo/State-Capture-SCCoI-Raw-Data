1610619033936127,2:07:11,Mishack Ngadi,the lady was being used for her brilliance because she so educated but she has to take the blame as well
1610619038625553,2:07:17,TheQueen V,@Godfrey I don't believe there's anything sinister. I think his team let him down on a technicality
1610619042440815,2:07:22,SD CREATIVES,What is it with this meeting?
1610619049667491,2:07:27,Naledi Barron,"@Dr. Chinedu Godfrey nwogo No, it was just a misstep."
1610619067153669,2:07:45,Teunis van Ree,Dr Chinedu I still believe DCJ was given the info about the summons
1610619067286343,2:07:45,Louis C,"@Marcus Mpanyane Ja ,ja. Says he from Mooikloof😀"
1610619100592770,2:08:19,Dr. Chinedu Godfrey nwogo,# Valencia Noted
1610619108329829,2:08:26,Diane Louw,"agree Valencia J and it was on the basis that the next day after the summons issued, he would go and do his avadavat"
1610619125219716,2:08:43,Teunis van Ree,@Valencia J guiding postgraduates
1610619130649059,2:08:48,Louis C,@Thembelani Mangena Interesting nevertheless
1610619154046181,2:09:13,peter ntloge,"I don't agree to Seleka being a genuine mistake he should have been thorough from onset,Koko and Co will get away on technicalities"
1610619155257371,2:09:14,Akhonamandla Gala,I agree with Naledi it was just an oversight
1610619206075824,2:10:04,Louis C,No bugs in the room
1610619210637373,2:10:08,Akhonamandla Gala,"if the mistake was deliberate, then what was Seleka going to gain by doing that?"
1610619226923676,2:10:25,Marcus Mpanyane,@Louis C There are shacks in Mooikloof :yougotthis:

1610619286662635,2:11:26,TheQueen V,"@Gala yes oversight, he shouldnt just take the word of his team he should double check"
1610619293156227,2:11:32,Heather Durr,Non lawyers with respect will have no idea how minor that point was. No self respecting lawyer would take that point. Only the ones in the mud
1610619315530302,2:11:53,Minnib Prince,GA friends. ....i did not DCJ's performance yesterdsy but our Seleka long time forgiven×××

1610619333436604,2:12:11,Teunis van Ree,@Heather Durr it was effective
1610619362078553,2:12:40,Akhonamandla Gala,"@Valentia J ja i agree he should have checked because they are getting paid for that, but he apologized we all make mistakes"
1610619363682408,2:12:42,Quinton van Eeden,"@peter ntloge - Seleka made the mistake of attributing the same level of professional behaviour that he adheres to, to the opposing team - he has learnt that they are not to be trusted"
1610619387706609,2:13:07,Jenny Whitewaves,If there are complaints of bias from DCJ it would be useful to have an incident of pro the thieves and telling of the legal team just saying 
1610619392885305,2:13:11,Lerato Moleke,"@Santa, yup it was about the Commission is a joke and how they are not united, blah blah "

1610619538754687,2:15:38,Dr. Chinedu Godfrey nwogo,"#Gala such oversight is very costly, cos it gives Anoj ample time to cover his loots/masters, and again his new defense attorney is same attorney that got the Bushiris out on bailed before they eloped"
1610619539764864,2:15:39,Lerato Moleke,... and obviously the Koko Hunt cult jumped in about how DCJ takes over when Koko is on the stand because Seleka doesn't know what he is doing

1610619780704698,2:19:40,Akhonamandla Gala,"@Dr Chinedu lol no you are taking this too far, relax. Those guys were just not yet prepared they wanted an extension. Advocate Seleka will deal with them, there's nothing to cover"
1610619808894530,2:20:07,Akhonamandla Gala,@Valentia J 😂
1610619814261496,2:20:14,TheQueen V,@Power GBV is violence perpetrated against the other gender wether it be a man or a woman. People should also learn that psychological violence is also a form of GBV on both genders

1610619901898734,2:21:41,Power Electronics,and lets say a Trans man Identify as a woman and beats up another woman is that gender based violence or a Cat fight
1610619902980465,2:21:42,TheQueen V,"@Power this is not the platform plz. but let me say, be who you want to be... do what makes you happy.. the world will adjust."
