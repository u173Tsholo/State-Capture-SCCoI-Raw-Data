1610619362078553,2:12:40,Akhonamandla Gala,"@Valentia J ja i agree he should have checked because they are getting paid for that, but he apologized we all make mistakes"
1610619363682408,2:12:42,Quinton van Eeden,"@peter ntloge - Seleka made the mistake of attributing the same level of professional behaviour that he adheres to, to the opposing team - he has learnt that they are not to be trusted"
1610619387706609,2:13:07,Jenny Whitewaves,If there are complaints of bias from DCJ it would be useful to have an incident of pro the thieves and telling of the legal team just saying
