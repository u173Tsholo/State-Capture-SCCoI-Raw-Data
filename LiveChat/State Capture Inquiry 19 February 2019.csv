1550566019945729,44:19,Nelson Musoliwa,If government change is well and reasonably explained to the markets(investors) there ant be any economic mayhem as it occurred in Nenegate
1550566042466385,44:42,Mzalwane Mzala,@grant wilkinson She also knows how to communicate her knowledge in a way that is understandable. There are smart people who fail get others to understand what is in their smart minds.
1550566049883647,44:50,Melvict Melbourne,@Yose Human can you please stop with this Zulu crap.
1550566053786186,44:54,Sofia Sofia,Hi @rohan barnard started late today .... 😗

1550566077920883,45:18,Jeremy D,its on lend learn to defend your camp
1550566084603626,45:24,rohan barnard,@grant wilkinson thank you. But even the US owes them a substantial amount of money.... So the US borows their own money from the world bank then?
1550566094469694,45:34,Felix Muyoba,@Melvict Melbourne he likes the zulus that is why
1550566115404760,45:55,Cebo Khumalo,I really am trying to understand this market confidence thing. How much of the banks manipulation (which banks have admitted to doing) is factored on the value of the Rand?
1550566158333459,46:38,Myka'Al Daud,"Prioritize them, their parents were oppressed for 400 years and they have no breadwinners"

1550566191332262,47:12,rohan barnard,"@Cebo Khumalo not long ago, Standard Charter bank actually admitted to manipulate the Rand"
1550566194802446,47:15,Wildthing,Cebo one question would be did that bank know what was going to happen. or did Gupta's know and inform them to trade in there favour.
1550566221251792,47:42,rohan barnard,@Melvict Melbourne just block that troll.
1550566227875570,47:47,Jeremy D,"gps kills satellites cost money,"
1550566253567082,48:13,Melvict Melbourne,@Myka'Al Daud nobody can get to 400 years in todays world. Handouts is not the way to go.
1550566271151925,48:31,Norman Zwane,"@Melvict Melbourne Actually that is an android plant you trying to address, Yose does not exist"
1550566282286450,48:42,Ibo Thabo,Why with all of the astonishing testimonies and proves on the rotten corruption by Mr Womaniser ignorant JC Zuma we still have diehard zumish who still saying 100% Z boy?
1550566287084649,48:47,Frik Brits,"@Anne M., I see here that people have blocked (Yose Human) but I still get his messages. So as I said before the SABC NEWS must appoint Moderators to block people."

1550566317929620,49:18,Felix Muyoba,the lady is educating the commission on economics today..dcj is stunned
1550566318190623,49:18,M T,Melvict - He s like a painful pile!
1550566324089448,49:24,Frik Brits,@Anne M. I think such blockings last for as long as the stream is active.
1550566324367393,49:24,Jeremy D,the ghost holding the scales?
1550566330508112,49:30,Cebo Khumalo,"I am simply asking, recently we were told banks manipulate the Rand, question is this woman’s report how much ignorance that is factored??"

1550566353217058,49:53,Norman Zwane,@Ibo Thabo Bcoz common sense aint that common
1550566360853881,50:01,Carl Theunissen,@Frik Brits you also have to block Yose on your side. I've blocked him a few weeks ago and he is still gone from my message line.
1550566392422534,50:32,PETER STAFFEN,JS Bach did the same
1550566411909857,50:52,Frik Brits,But everyone else sees his messages .......... it does not help mush does it??
1550566429478570,51:09,rohan barnard,"@Frik Brits nope. I blocked human quite a while ago, and he doesn't show up on my feed"
1550566433643498,51:13,Carl Theunissen,@Frik Brits
1550566444410449,51:25,Wildthing,Cebo they came to SA with 1 Million in 1993. And in 2016 bought a mansion in Dubai worth $46 million and can't show where all the money comes from. And bought many places in India.
1550566444868382,51:25,Nelson Musoliwa,Unstable political situation raise uncertainty on markets drivers so they usually reduce their economic operations in such country; simply put no one will invest with unstable countries
1550566456963594,51:37,Norman Zwane,@Thando Nkutha It was wasted breath talking into the echo chamber Zuma was
1550566481964349,52:02,Carl Theunissen,"@Frik Brits if I block him, but you don't, it won't help you. If you want him to disappear, you have to block him yourself."
1550566489786826,52:10,Neil Fraser,There are a minority who write hate messages daily. And I'm yet to see anyone win an argument with emotion and hate speech. Such slow learners.
1550566492191522,52:13,Cebo Khumalo,Michael so did the Oppenheimers/ your Rupert’s and many more!!
1550566494592036,52:14,Willie Makena,@NormanZwane I agree with you the lady should teach and train up coming economists and accountants
