1575363271855679,53:42,The Real SamQ,I wonder how much has been spent on this enquiry?
1575363311009439,54:21,Elvis Malakoane,we must wonder how much was stolen not how we spent to fix
1575363314505060,54:24,Re Al,I wonder how much has been spent on corruption:/
1575363322405143,54:32,Pastor J.J,@anya van loggerenberg ...Please enlighten us all. What is the basis for your views that this is a smokescreen.?
1575363352010572,55:02,Sandile Ndlovu,as we speak more than R40 000 000
1575363367964863,55:17,Robert Russell,@Sam_Q Mbanjwa .....the last I read the cost was R253 MILLION
1575363376969004,55:27,Sandile Ndlovu,on the enquiry
1575363397580760,55:48,Sandile Ndlovu,I am not sure on corruption
1575363398147785,55:49,Elvis Malakoane,Pastor j some people like derailing us to find the truth by critiquing this commission
1575363406908764,55:57,Mario Johnson,mornig they stole everything didnt even leave coim
1575363417183437,56:07,Mario Johnson,coins
1575363426899145,56:17,Re Al,The money spent on this commission could be recovered by the successful prosecution and attachment of assets of 1 corrupt official. So lets not get hung up by such small things
1575363443710810,56:34,Pastor J.J,@Elvis Malakoane ....That is so true
1575363475718055,57:05,Elvis Malakoane,Bianca Arnold morning Bianca
1575363486695425,57:16,anya van loggerenberg,@Pastor J believing that something is being done but no one will do anything to bring criminals too book
1575363538562546,58:09,Phillip Cwazibe,"@Bianca Arnold He said that he was dismissed, he said that he met the Minister at the airport and then a letter that was not received by the minister. Lies and lies."
1575363560165664,58:31,Pastor J.J,The NPA has already said as a fact that they have prepared charge sheets with evidence coming from this Commission. Lets give it a chance @anya van loggerenberg
1575363560447135,58:31,Elvis Malakoane,Jommy Manyi did name dropping and lies
1575363636696782,59:47,Phillip Cwazibe,@ Pastor J ​ The NPA will pursue charges.
1575363690539095,1:00:40,anya van loggerenberg,@Pastor J i know we have to be patient but our patience is running low we need to see some action!!! this process is going too slow
1575363692142482,1:00:42,Pastor J.J,@Phillip Cwazibe They have said that and committed to that already. Adv Hermine Cronje has been appointed totall for that task.
1575363716715407,1:01:07,Phillip Cwazibe,@ Bianca Arnold he said he discussed with Ms Oliphant the removal of another minister. Another lie
1575363736579362,1:01:26,Robert Russell,Advocate Kate Hoffmeyer is so professional and well prepared...... if ever I needed a Advocate it would be her for sure.....
1575363796252543,1:02:26,Zukile Mawisa,"I don't even want to hold my breath, I'll see it when they get arrested."
1575363800819706,1:02:30,Elvis Malakoane,anya van loggenberg Soon something will happen from NPA and the HAWKS I have trust in the current NDPP
1575363819071610,1:02:50,Mshika Mshika,"@Pastor J Most people here comment based on their emotions not facts, and usually emotional comments are baseless"
1575363825443563,1:02:55,anya van loggerenberg,@Robert Russell she is amazing a breath of fresh air
1575363844560020,1:03:14,Phillip Cwazibe,@ Robert Russell ​ Advocate Kate Hoffmeyer is always clear and follows all her arguments/questions in a logical manner.
1575363888271479,1:03:58,معلم هارون الحسن HarunaAlhassan,Nice
1575363898862305,1:04:09,anya van loggerenberg,@Elvis Malakoane i hope you are right but yes we have to stay positive difficult as it seems
1575363905699145,1:04:15,Pastor J.J,@Mshika Mshika ...Yes you are right. I also understand peoples frustrations particularly when corruption was evident and no action during those dreaded 9years@anya van loggerenberg
1575363983703062,1:05:34,Elvis Malakoane,correct Anya
1575364002688505,1:05:53,Pastor J.J,She has already implicated Jimmyboy Manyi in Perjury and lying under oath.
1575364052200058,1:06:42,Phillip Cwazibe,Pastor J ​ She has already implicated Jimmyboy Manyi 5 times by now.
1575364056755275,1:06:46,Mshika Mshika,"@Pastor J people must also note that we a dealing with a network of criminals not individuals, so thorough investigation is required not hear say"
1575364101514993,1:07:32,LED BULPS,",can they deploy a lie deterctor test for this. put it right next to the table of the witnesses...henceforth...re ka lapa maan"
1575364112175840,1:07:42,Pastor J.J,@Mshika Mshika ...That is a brilliant assessment of the status quo of the situation. Well said
1575364157718726,1:08:27,Frago Selamolela,this criminals don't even take this inquiry serious
1575364166809275,1:08:37,Elvis Malakoane,LEd Bulps that machine will give up

1575364244638702,1:09:55,LED BULPS,",i can imagine...but if theres a legal person here..can they advice...is it possible?"
1575364284317186,1:10:34,Pheladi Lamola,"It makes no sense for them to come here and lie. Obviously these advocates follow-up on everything. And Ms Hoffmeyer is busy repeating the question of the letter, so Ms Oliphant had better be sure."
1575364371974093,1:12:01,Kevin Davis,how many prosecutions have started by this man of action rhamaphosa since he has said a
1575364406690077,1:12:37,LED BULPS,",Pheladi you havent been listening. did you get the extremes of the two evidences...its obvious some of them come here to lie,eyeball straight..."
1575364415661248,1:12:45,Kevin Davis,Overland over again he is a man of action then he is astounded by the lack of investment
1575364417305070,1:12:47,Elvis Malakoane,I don't think Ms Oliphant is a lier I think she is going to throw jimmy under the bus
1575364450696905,1:13:21,Pastor J.J,@LED BULPS ...Lie Detector tests are done on a voluntary basis only and cannot be imposed otherwise. Also it is not seen as evidential material in a Court process.
1575364459280564,1:13:29,Kevin Davis,Elvis no busses here only Mercedes Benz
1575364509188985,1:14:19,Kevin Davis,tea with curry served by uncle tony
1575364521864414,1:14:32,Elvis Malakoane,yes it is so Bianca
1575364543657546,1:14:54,LED BULPS,",ofcourse yes Pastor..and the coming of giving evidence is voluntary as well...they are not forced.they can submit an affidavit isnt it?"
1575364552260680,1:15:02,Phillip Cwazibe,@ Elvis Malakoane ​I Indeed Ms Oliphant is not a lier. Mr Manyi is already under the bus and sort of direct to the back wheels.
1575364653618408,1:16:43,Pastor J.J,@LED BULPS ...Evidence from Affidavits only must be lead by additional evidence being led and subjected to scrutiny. Otherwise it is useless like Zuma saying I will send an affidavit but not be questi
1575364672821621,1:17:03,Pastor J.J,questioned about it under cross examination.
1575364718537527,1:17:49,LED BULPS,",but we agree that they come here voluntarily?"
1575364778404911,1:18:49,Pastor J.J,@LED BULPS ...Mostly yes...but implicated parties may be forced to do so via a Subpoena if they dont do so voluntarily
1575364827531665,1:19:38,LED BULPS,",correct..so we must ask why not deploy the detector?"
1575364889906418,1:20:40,Pastor J.J,@LED BULPS ....Because it has never ever been certified to be 100% reliable anywhere in the world.
1575364955177455,1:21:45,Pastor J.J,@LED BULPS ...Even speed cameras have been successfully interrogated in court and cases where won.
1575365047752638,1:23:18,LED BULPS,",aaai ..thats neither here nor there...it is a material factor to evidence giving and question answering...and the speed camera is a matter of consequence not persona injuria..."
1575365087887243,1:23:58,Pastor J.J,It is what it is unfortunately @LED BULPS
1575365562038247,1:31:53,Elvis Malakoane,so Raddy Direko wants to cross examine former President and former President is opposing the application --That is telling for a character
1575365722724509,1:34:33,Marcus Levack,Jimmy manyi is a liar
1575365827511276,1:36:17,Simphiwe Msomi,but I really don't believe Manyie told Lies..

1575365869760899,1:37:00,Pastor J.J,And so say all of us @Marcus Levack

1575366173991268,1:42:04,Elvis Malakoane,he will avoid as much as possible
1575366191508921,1:42:22,Pastor J.J,I feel that this Aunty is not telling the truth. She needs to tell us that she was asked by the Gupta's and Zuma to appoint him after he was dismissed and she was appointed a Minister.

1575366417200730,1:46:07,Mike Meyer,yes!
1575366474245653,1:47:04,Kabelo Katjedi,"Mbuso thats how it is ,whether u like or not.Mention 1 politician already appeared b4 this commission and gave u something 2 prosecute those involved.They all protects themselves if nt friends"
1575366475208937,1:47:05,Elvis Malakoane,pastor j so she is ether lying or delaying the truth
1575366483465687,1:47:13,Pastor J.J,This Aunty is lying and that is the end of my story on her.
1575366507064435,1:47:37,Pastor J.J,@Elvis Malakoane Lying and passing the buck it seems.
