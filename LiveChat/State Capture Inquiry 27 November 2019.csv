1574850303430741,2:18:08,Elvis Malakoane,pastor j How tolerant is that for a person produced by youth league
1574850314960965,2:18:19,Pastor J.J,@redriger ...What control? The police are selling guns for R200 each and R20 per bullet. No control there friend
1574850375285769,2:19:20,Pastor J.J,@Elvis Malakoane ...Tolerance is anongst one of the fundamental traits that Julius doe not possess.
1574850445158349,2:20:29,Elvis Malakoane,so if you fire a bullet in public at the stadium u are called COMMANDER IN CHIEF
1574850554085705,2:22:18,Pastor J.J,@Elvis Malakoane ...After the recent revelations it has now changed to C.I.T a.k.a COMMANDER IN THIEF i think
1574850598790700,2:23:03,Elvis Malakoane,ohk that suits him
1574850625283567,2:23:29,Elvis Malakoane,ohk that suits him
1574850677080748,2:24:21,MSG Rules,Just a side note...So CIT started the EFF to get everything for free?
1574850704057539,2:24:48,MSG Rules,Does that then infer the EFF works for the ANC as they trained him?
1574850743540306,2:25:27,Elvis Malakoane,for a faction in the ANC
1574850764193446,2:25:48,Pastor J.J,"@MSG Rules ....That seems to be the rumour doing the rounds. He was top of the class during his training despite the earlier ""f"" in woodwork."

1574850942293026,2:28:46,Pastor J.J,@MSG Rules ...Sadly for our poor people. The VBS saga does change the status quo somewhat. Does not sound like rumours anymore
1574850947959043,2:28:51,Elvis Malakoane,his behaviour resonates with a certain faction in the ANC of people with less brains and strong hands to steal
1574851010606670,2:29:55,MSG Rules,@pastor very sad the shepherds became the wolves. the only way to get some ort of justice is for the wolves to go to prison
1574851126142005,2:31:50,MSG Rules,Really hope this commission will show the power that it has and that our President acts upon it
1574851169897780,2:32:34,Pastor J.J,@MSG Rules ...Its the new norm. Just look around and see our many Pastors have become wolves. It makes it easier to be a political wolf at times. Deeply saddening
