1605598425438221,-20:34,Kieron Sinewave,i dont think any1 here qualified enough to talk this amount of trash
1605598425815121,-20:34,See Earth,"By all means, but understand this: make claims like that and you are a joke"
1605598481502385,-19:38,See Earth,david ick is a fraudster who is simply making money out of those gullible enough to believe his rubbish
1605598484264090,-19:35,Kelly Jurgens,@ see earth so you disagree that the NWO does not run the world?
1605598496279779,-19:23,Maritime Studies,Free earth - really? Let’s agree to agree on that. You have your views which I won’t say you lost credibility about.
1605598504898611,-19:15,Heather Durr,"Hi @Kieron Sinewave We are discussing the future of the world and conspiracy theories which are, in fact, reality for many in this chat room"
1605598522849302,-18:57,bongile sango,Does this means Zuma is not going to testify at all now. Because he's playing delaying tactics
1605598530016054,-18:49,Kieron Sinewave,@Heather Durr ye i got it 😕
1605598547751885,-18:32,See Earth,"I agree that NWO is indeed a conspiracy theory, with no basis in fact."
1605598595382960,-17:44,Kelly Jurgens,@see earth so do you believe that the 'Pandemic' exist?
1605598634284732,-17:05,See Earth,"@Kieron Sinewave you would be an imbecile to think otherwise. I have lost friends and family, so don't play games here."
1605598643287033,-16:56,M Place,"David Icke is educated man, evil according to the bible has to take a shape or form...9/11, JFK, Princess Diana, Covid 19...all these events with no answers..."

1605598702831411,-15:57,Kieron Sinewave,"imagine if everyone did their job and only spoke about what they know 😆 😆 speculation is awesome, esp coupled with research .. its a game that needs players, obv. but where are the pros? not here"
1605598706362374,-15:53,Maritime Studies,"Yhoo, See earth, are you real?"
1605598706981568,-15:52,Heather Durr,@bongile sango Hi Zuma's applications will all be rejected as per the blatant blackmail by his counsel [altho it is the obvious path]. I hope they have other witnesses tor this week
1605598750356305,-15:09,See Earth,This diversion tactic will backfire
1605598768019948,-14:51,Teunis van Ree,Zuma won't say anything useful
1605598811722715,-14:08,Teunis van Ree,@Heather Durr I agree they should have some spare witnesses lined up
1605598813907356,-14:06,Maritime Studies,"Heather, having listened to Pretorius, I support you."
1605598816716679,-14:03,See Earth,@Teunis van Ree it's what he doesn't say that will be most revealing
1605598866048212,-13:13,Maritime Studies,Mr Place- Spot on
1605598871790733,-13:08,Teunis van Ree,Same as with Dudu. Adv Pretorius's propositions will stand
1605598944943763,-11:54,bongile sango,@Heather I think this week was scheduled for him.I also wish they've maid an arrangements for other witness.
1605599009380633,-10:50,Heather Durr,@Maritime Studies @Teunis van Ree There is no reason not to interrogate Zuma pending the applications. I doubt his counsel will allow it.
1605599016693902,-10:43,Maritime Studies,"I am not agains the. COmmission, but I still believe Law enforcement must do its job."
1605599016832381,-10:43,Heather Durr,Another session of 'non incrimination' will be fun but Pretorius is not as aggressive and quick as Kate and Myburg
1605599051725091,-10:08,FieliesSA,@Teunis van Ree They dont have to say anything usefull. Its about the questions that the commision is putting to whim with proof
1605599104559332,-9:15,Teunis van Ree,@FieliesSA correct
1605599118614350,-9:01,Heather Durr,If they had any sense they would have realised that Zuma would not testify under any circumstances. They should have witnesses lined up
1605599198899061,-7:41,M Place,@Maritime...true..all the SIU reports were sitting with the Hawks before the commission was even thought of...prosecute...rather than waist money.
1605599199808942,-7:40,bongile sango,I so wish the billion has been spent here can't be like waste. we want to see the results
1605599240650523,-6:59,See Earth,"They still have to ask him the questions, even if he doesn't answer. He has to be given the chance to give his side of the story. That is what makes this a fair commission."
1605599293019300,-6:06,Kieron Sinewave,"""if not you, then who?"" tactic will glean more results"
1605599414391095,-4:05,Maritime Studies,"Bongile, Courts have the power to expose everything. This Commission is toothless. Look at it being held into ransom by Zuma and Dudu- who are tolerated by Zondo"
