1582103113943615,57:50,Gabisile Mabuza,you separate from and not to Ms Dlamini
1582103137510445,58:13,wim louw,She is the next PP
1582103158384215,58:33,funicanz,@wim louw 😆😆
1582103192617518,59:08,Pastor J.J,@Eliot Chauke . If Zuma was elected directly by the public and not the ANC NEC I doubt he would ever have been elected to be president. Many dont regard him as their president. U are an exception
1582103202237319,59:17,Hennie Cloete,#Granny-any academic qualification should be seen as a stepping stone-practical exposure gives substance.
1582103215606413,59:32,Jacqui Baumgardt,@Pastor J - agree
1582103217499901,59:34,Cruda Bex,she is the daughter of black south African father who De kerk failed to kill.
1582103223897905,59:39,Thokozile Mokoenanyana,Elliot Chauke keep on dreaming. JZ is the president of his cult NOT SA!
1582103229043881,59:45,Singi Mathebula,The witness is Ms Dlamini from SSA and is responsible for vetting. she is a chief director
1582103257713970,1:00:12,Eliot Chauke,@Pastor J. you forget that Zuma is more popular than Ramaphosa. People love Zuma.. its a fact.
1582103258815575,1:00:13,Dominic Przybylski,Thanks @Singi Mathebula
1582103272930567,1:00:29,funicanz,Ms Dlamini knows her story.
1582103278085429,1:00:34,JJ Elimimian,Against foreign Nationals; balance checks
1582103283936375,1:00:40,Cruda Bex,She is queen Red Dlamini
1582103299150873,1:00:55,Pastor J.J,@Eliot Chauke ...I respectfully but utterly and totally disagree with you.
1582103306988599,1:01:03,Eliot Chauke,Zuma is your President. like it or not
1582103330961724,1:01:26,Hennie Cloete,#Eliot-dream on!!
1582103341657613,1:01:38,Jacqui Baumgardt,@Eliot they also love Dudu Myeni because of her patronage
1582103348694610,1:01:44,Eliot Chauke,Look at how Cyril won Conference. vs How Zuma won
1582103363240419,1:02:00,JJ Elimimian,Raised like parks and recreariom
1582103389791142,1:02:26,Eliot Chauke,ANC went below 60% under Cyril... Zuma was always above 60%
1582103414858941,1:02:50,Cruda Bex,We need statues of Zuma in front of all South Africa prisons
1582103421002884,1:02:56,Thokozile Mokoenanyana,@Chauke thieves masquerading as RET love JZ not us the voters and uncaptured members of the ANC
1582103452541920,1:03:29,Eliot Chauke,We must start with the Murderer De Klerk statues
1582103465188376,1:03:41,Singi Mathebula,@Eliot Chauke. it seems they gave you overdose when joining Zuma cult
1582103474159206,1:03:50,Margareth Waterboer,Can’t handle...
1582103482352345,1:03:58,Pastor J.J,It was a typical case of a fairer sheep leading the goats to the slaughter.They had a smile on their faces sadly whilst being slaughtered. Thats like a cult @Eliot Chauke
1582103499580317,1:04:15,Eliot Chauke,All ANC members are captured
1582103502557111,1:04:18,Thokozile Mokoenanyana,Agreed @Cruda that's where he belongs
1582103513296568,1:04:30,clive oconnell,@Cruda Just goes to show I’m right voters should have IQ test to vote.

1582103558292494,1:05:14,Dominic Przybylski,@Thokozile Mokoenanyana In your estimation how many official members of ANC are not captured as a percentage?
1582103558937808,1:05:15,Eliot Chauke,Ramaphosa is Captured by corporates
1582103574238684,1:05:30,Zukisani Mpahlana,Lo sisi bekumele ucele ukuthetha ulwimi lakhe coz andiqondba uyaziva. Uthetha eziphikisa

1582103617454324,1:06:14,Dominic Przybylski,Ramaphosa is captured by consensus.
1582103633449927,1:06:29,Singi Mathebula,Zuma stole from the poor he claimed to represent.
1582103661506082,1:06:57,Eliot Chauke,Cyril is stealing from you as we speak @Singi
1582103666795558,1:07:02,Jacqui Baumgardt,@Dominic Przybylski - agree - he's caught between a rock and a hard place
1582103723083866,1:07:58,Eliot Chauke,CR17 campaign is the root of State Capture... done in broad daylight.
1582103732136508,1:08:08,Dominic Przybylski,Collective responsibility castrates leadership.
1582103741302094,1:08:17,MIKE DURBAN,@Eliot Chauke ...True...the Commies are trying to capture ...Everybody......
1582103767019081,1:08:42,Margareth Waterboer,Is it really language tripping her up or incompetence to grasp questions...I mean she couldn’t even understand ‘it’s on the spine’.. I’m worried about such people in important work places...
1582103777080568,1:08:52,noko malatji,i think they are political employees since the minister is the employer
1582103779998502,1:08:56,Singi Mathebula,Cyril never and will never stole from me because Zuma never shared a cent with me@Eliot Chauke
1582103811524518,1:09:28,Margareth Waterboer,"Help me today...please dear father, I beg for patience.."

1582108764757954,2:32:00,Pastor J.J,@Oscar N ..You may be right about the talk and embrace approach if it has a positive and amicable outcome. Being antagonistic is not acceptable though.
1582108771672935,2:32:07,Lerato Ramadiro,@ Dave Sinclair... Questions are ambiguous and of legal inclination to get her to agree or disagree when at times she neither agrees nor disagrees with the questions or statements referred to
