1565878868813606,2:17:27,Dumza Maswana,"Lol I'm not upset Buyiswa, I just wanted you to think again. We wouldn't even have this platform under apartheid"
1565878887246720,2:17:45,Kevin Simon,"Zuma, Zwane at al had no idea that the state's income is limited. Why was the State working and paying for private sector plans?"
