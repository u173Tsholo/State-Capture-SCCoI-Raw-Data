1597917535117754,1:52:27,Melvict Melbourne,many ministers in theNP drove themselves.
1597917591577846,1:53:23,DJNaija,"It is proper for retired military officers above the rank of Captain to continue to use their military rank as their formal title (instead of ""Mr"") However that is not the protocol for the police."

1597918001583860,2:00:14,Pheladi Lamola,I don't know why but I'm feeling sorry for this man.
1597918007289637,2:00:19,DJNaija,Mr. P O'Sullivan once went into Alex (Jhb) for an investigation. This was when he was a SAPS reservist. In the course of this endeavor a suspect dropped his partner with a brick to the head.

1597918705833223,2:11:58,Dominic Przybylski,In the military a brigadeer is usually in charge of three to six battalions (1000 per battalion). Does anyone know if and how it differs in police force?
1597918755814023,2:12:47,Ray BarK,Brigadiers take care of the communal beer fridge
1597918792036457,2:13:24,DANIEL MKHABELA,the witness self doesn't know what he is testifying about he can't even find page numbers in front of him.
1597918795422733,2:13:27,Tebogo Sibilanga,In SAPS a brigadier is someone who gets parachuted into a position he/she does not deserve as long as he/she is politically connected

1597919000045597,2:16:52,Ray BarK,Hahaha forgot he took it while getting some cigarettes on Marlboro drive
1597919145077960,2:19:17,watson mutanga,Party cadres have to have jobs and are deployed strategically. There are posts that require the most intelligent but they deploy the least intelligent so as to use them in carrying out nefarious acts.
1597919200640999,2:20:13,Dominic Przybylski,I suspect that high ranking officers in SAPS and SANDF outnumber low ranking officers. Any stats out there?
1597919218917029,2:20:31,Nghamula Nkuna,That is how it works Watson.
1597919228623678,2:20:41,Ray BarK,So no reason for a subpoena ¿ no implication in the crime and they still seized it?
1597919237347071,2:20:48,DANIEL MKHABELA,are you aware that most witnesses before the commission especially those from anc don't remember anything about all corrupt activities they have done. they are in a dream land.
