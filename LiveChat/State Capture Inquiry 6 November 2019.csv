1573028286037750,7:28,Person of interest,looks like they moved
1573028286835223,7:29,Pastor J.J,"@Lex Luger @Yolo More . You are correct DCJ limited and restricted him excessively in interrogating the evidence of Jimmy ""Naughty Boy"" Manyi. It seems that was the reasoning of the fallout."
1573028349034893,8:31,nhlanhla nkosi,it's temporary venue
1573028354554418,8:36,Person of interest,"Hai, I didn't have enough of Maleka."

1573028482668531,10:44,Yolo More,"Pastor J, if the chair was not too restrictive, there would be a festival of chairs between Maleka and Manyi."
1573028546609418,11:49,Pastor J.J,I think that when Maleka was restricted he should have pulled out the Sjambok and sorted this Jimmy thingie staright away. Hahahahahaha
1573028631510350,13:13,Eliot Chauke,Different venue?
1573028644487169,13:26,Yolo More,"Manyi is a coward, he would run away and the chair does not want that."

1573029012727807,19:34,Richard Nyila,Zuma cant handle the state capture its becoming too hot to handle than anticipated. Last time he mentioned his voice going up and down due to flu no wonder what illness does he have now.
1573029073925081,20:36,Person of interest,judge def has respiratory problems ingoung
1573029097948255,21:00,Person of interest,ongoing
1573029110076470,21:12,sechaba Montso,when is Mr Jacob Zuma going preson?
1573029110545349,21:12,Richard Nyila,Lies has short legs it does not travel far. I will advise him to take a shower so that the illness can go away or be healed so that he can attend the state capture commission..
1573029117118017,21:19,Pastor J.J,@Richard Nyila ....But he could have taken a shower for the flu as well. He said that the shower is the perfect cure for everything. Shame on him for still ducking and diving.
1573029221817255,23:04,Richard Nyila,On the 2nd thought Pastor you hit a nail in the head there true indeed.
1573029316338801,24:38,Thapelo Motabogi,"morning guys,has the venue changed"
1573029452967409,26:55,WareWolf,Whats going on
1573029459601647,27:00,Francoise Phillips,The doctor who booked Zuma off 'sick' needs to be investigated. Zuma is a con artist.
1573029487477914,27:29,WareWolf,Zuma is too sick to appear?? LOOOOOOOOL
1573029532479126,28:14,Francoise Phillips,Looking forward to hearing from Manyi how he managed to pay for ANN7 on his meagre government salary.
1573029562587943,28:44,WareWolf,Where is this place?
1573029581908534,29:03,Derek Main,@Thapelo Motabogi Yes - JHB Council Chamber
1573029596460062,29:18,Pastor J.J,"@Francoise Phillips The same skelm who was Shabir ""Tiger Woods"" Shaik""s Doctor. Buggers"
1573029602545114,29:24,sechaba Montso,Is Mr Zuma liable to chances of impresonment at anytime ever?
1573029634312298,29:56,WareWolf,Did the old venue become a security risk? Or why did they change?
1573029666367713,30:28,Pastor J.J,@Shane Aniruth The Landlord is an implicated Party
1573029780093386,32:22,Richard Nyila,@Francois Phillips if i recall the ANN7 was sold to Manyi for half a Billion (R500 M) i just cant remember the term or the agreement that was entered into between Manyi and the Guptas on repayments?
1573029789756664,32:32,Ricus Ellis,"The venue is to be used by the owner of the venue for the rest of the week. Thereafter, the return to the usual venue"
1573029866602357,33:48,Francoise Phillips,@Richar Nyila I clearly remember Manyi stating to the press that he had 'fully paid up' the half a billion. Strange for an ex government spokesperson to have such funds.
1573029886938276,34:09,WareWolf,"Ricus Ellis, that's so odd"
1573029900760782,34:23,Derek Main,@Francoise Phillips Manyi lost his money.
1573029923174577,34:45,Francoise Phillips,Derek Main I doubt he ever had any.
1573030048277260,36:50,Derek Main,"@Francoise Phillips True ""The purchase price is to be funded by Oakbay via a loan it advances to Manyi‚Äôs company."""
1573030078526008,37:21,Richard Nyila,@Francois Jhaaa nhee interesting indeed i thought there entered into some sort of arrangement because Manyi did not have R500 M then i missed that one that he paid in full then he is the loser indeed.
1573030116112240,37:58,sechaba Montso,would the commission supply me with documents evidance of the case at hand?
1573030346756498,41:48,Francoise Phillips,This lady is thorough.
1573030522814285,44:44,Elvis Malakoane,I think commission sent Zuma today's affidavits rebutting his previous testimony and found out that he will further embarrass himself
1573030652651634,46:54,Elvis Malakoane,basically all he said last time was simply not true -i like this Adv's follow ups
1573030658788249,47:00,Edd Dance,Zuma will be coming on 11th November

1573030800131486,49:21,Thabelo Emmanuel,big up Zuma there is no need for you to come here ths is a waste of ur tym
1573030853829275,50:15,Derek Main,@Thabelo Emmanuel I agree with you - he must just go to his corruption case. Whatever he says here is a lie.
1573030895192914,50:57,MIKE DURBAN,No special treatment for him....at all....
1573030954922362,51:56,Thabelo Emmanuel,he will never come coz he protect the corrupt Anc

1573031168798059,55:31,Edd Dance,"I personally think, the citizens should stand up and demand justice, we should do country shut down to demand this arrests"
1573031214788449,56:16,Edd Dance,"rural and urban citizens, all companies, local and international"
1573031252414705,56:54,Derek Main,@Pastor J ü§£ Yep - he's breaking all the records. That's also why he built a chicken run.
1573031261588813,57:03,Rob Nel,"Zuma might appear coming Monday, ala Shabir style. In a hospital bed, wearing a onesie, covered with Rajah, curry powder emblems."

1573031342970193,58:25,Derek Main,@EDWARD LEGONG I agree - we SAfns are far too patient with these crooks. They continue to be in government and continue to steal the money.
1573031404291059,59:26,Armando Andre Vicente,things are going worse and worse
1573031407876018,59:30,Rasheed Maroos,I agree with Edward Legong we should

1573031445512365,1:00:07,Mbuso Ndlovu,Who is in the hot seat??????????????????????????
1573031475866840,1:00:37,Richard Nyila,ESKOM alone owes debtors R450 Billion and it cant even repay interests on monthly basis from that amount because it running at a loss. Spend more money on operations than maintainance and upkeep...
1573031479196611,1:00:41,Derek Main,All these politicians are robbing us blind. They are the only ones not feeling the pinch. They live large.
1573031482593549,1:00:44,Elvis Malakoane,themba maseko
1573031495231989,1:00:57,Dan Brown,The Tea Lady/ Mixer Operator is asleep at the wheel as usual. Jeez Louise. You guys can't get the sound right two hours in a row.

1573031558639488,1:02:00,Pastor J.J,@Dan Brown Check your device and volume settings. The volume has been 100% great since the start
1573031572480501,1:02:14,Derek Main,"@Elvis Malakoane If his lips are moving, he's lying."
1573031601954996,1:02:44,Elvis Malakoane,I hear you
1573031636148394,1:03:18,Elvis Malakoane,badboy he will break that machine or confuse it

1573031660881898,1:03:43,Mbuso Ndlovu,This venue looks strange to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1573031679519333,1:04:01,Thabelo Emmanuel,Edward even Ramaphosa is corrupt himself
1573031741288694,1:05:03,Edd Dance,"Am hurt cos, they eat the money, we pay tax, we suffer while they live luxury"

1573031814951417,1:06:16,Derek Main,@Elvis Malakoane Yes - at least then we know we are not being BSed.
1573031862970661,1:07:05,Elvis Malakoane,Derek Main then we must pray he gets stroke
1573031873753984,1:07:15,Kapn Krunch,if you dont deal with dangers to society it just emboldens other dangers to society
1573031897596582,1:07:39,Derek Main,"@EDWARD LEGONG Unfortunately, we are to blame. We allow the politicians to get away with it."
1573031906336685,1:07:48,Kapn Krunch,our leaders need to have fear or they will never change their corrupt ways
1573031934993425,1:08:17,Edd Dance,"Seriously, we need a country shutdown."
1573031970093684,1:08:51,Derek Main,@EDWARD LEGONG Or a tax revolt. Shut off their funds.
1573031996548530,1:09:18,Edd Dance,"Prosecuting those found guilty now, will make others to crack under pressure and reveal truth and safe us time and money."
1573032018087350,1:09:40,Edd Dance,"Yah, we demand tax cut down"
1573032026520980,1:09:48,Kapn Krunch,tax revolt will just hurt the less fortunate of our country we need to use the power vested in us and just vote properly
1573032101766915,1:11:03,Kapn Krunch,the anc have been looting our country for 25 years and we keep putting them back in power what sort of message do you think that sends them
1573032130160998,1:11:32,Rasheed Maroos,We need to develop a system that will monitor they too much government bodies and it should be by the public through a process done so in public domain or platform we here all public can have a say
1573032190104460,1:12:32,Derek Main,"@Kapn Krunch While I agree with you RE the ANC looting, I think all politicians are the same. How many politicians voted against their own enormous salary increases?"
1573032248779991,1:13:30,Singi Mathebula,i agree@ Robert Nyila
1573032350524652,1:15:12,Kapn Krunch,we need to strip their wealth and put them in the slammer we need them to feel the fear so they can actually do something productive or face the consequences or nothing will ever change
1573032415772231,1:16:17,wendy hardy,Kapn Krunch I agree with you !
1573032498379039,1:17:40,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha You mean to the ANC? You'd have to have rocks in your head to vote for them after hearing of all this corruption.
1573032557783498,1:18:40,WareWolf,"Weed party yay, lets all be hippies and return to nature"
1573032577042557,1:18:58,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha That's not an either-or. There are many other parties.
1573032608902107,1:19:31,MIKE DURBAN,Any party except the Commie ANC and EFF.....really .....I reckon some sort of coalition form of Gov.......
1573032674207958,1:20:36,Kapn Krunch,we must remove race from political parties thats one of our biggest problems its all about race
1573032700235554,1:21:02,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Yes - I do. I think they are fools for voting ANC. We've heard of how the ANC politicians behave from this commission. What on earth makes you think they care for us?
1573032831170168,1:23:13,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Like I've said - there are other parties. The ANC have proven they cannot govern with any integrity. The other parties should be given the opportunity to improve on that.
1573032863033864,1:23:45,Kapn Krunch,all parties should represent south africans not demographics of south africans is all im saying
1573032882907553,1:24:05,Kapn Krunch,how do we unify when government constantly segregate
1573032902345156,1:24:24,MIKE DURBAN,So then they are to blame.........they are then predetermining their own future..........just like Zim.....China........Ven.........etc etc etc....
1573032955577060,1:25:17,MIKE DURBAN,All just sheepal ...I'm afraid..........
1573032968630173,1:25:30,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha You're right - I'm not understanding your point. Are you saying the the ANC voters may vote for DA & FF+?
1573033007210533,1:26:09,Kapn Krunch,ANC are populist and just tell whoevers listening what they want to hear they are like cheap conmen decieving millions
1573033077716173,1:27:19,MIKE DURBAN,If the DA are doing what the ANC have done.....Wound NEVER vote for them.......cannot be Married to a particular party........use da brains.....
1573033104982484,1:27:46,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha You do realise that at the last national elections there were something like 48 parties to vote for.
1573033112642112,1:27:55,Kapn Krunch,madiba didnt tell people what they want to hear he told people what they needed to hear its not just politics its bad politics
1573033204603297,1:29:26,Derek Main,"As long as the ANC is in power, we will continue on our downward spiral. Moody's won't indulge us forever."
1573033279966917,1:30:42,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha You don't have that excuse anymore.
1573033295605027,1:30:57,Singi Mathebula,Revive UDF
1573033306710626,1:31:08,MIKE DURBAN,@Derek Main ......Man......people just cannot or will not.....think further than the nose........true.....
1573033311802086,1:31:13,Kapn Krunch,"he told everyone that all were equal and all south africans, he had to fight against white and black domination many were not pleased about that im sure"
1573033321969026,1:31:24,Kapn Krunch,nobody wanted to hear that
1573033337922701,1:31:40,Kapn Krunch,he stood against vengeance
1573033348038313,1:31:50,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha No - there are other parties.
1573033357058415,1:31:59,Phathu Maqavana,Has the venue changed? ü§î
1573033410938345,1:32:52,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha And most of us were overjoyed then - now we cry when the ANC wins.
1573033445056294,1:33:27,Kapn Krunch,i disagree
1573033482241798,1:34:04,Rob Nel,Love that settlements is only in millions of rand.
1573033505975377,1:34:27,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha So what you are saying is that you are being ruled by fear - fear of the EFF. I never want to live my life being ruled by fear.

1573034505300598,1:51:07,Derek Main,"@Thando Nkutha I ask you with tears in my eyes - if the ANC, after 25 years has gotten us to where we are now, how will voting for them again improve our situation?"
1573034516953541,1:51:19,Karen x,Mbuso Ndlovu pay attention and NEVER suggest a BOMB...the normal place is hired out - simple
1573034622699347,1:53:04,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha You're right - the ANC is definitely not going to turn it around.
1573034719917359,1:54:41,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Karen x How can they hire such important place for the commission; This is a waste of taxpayers money

1573034930284009,1:58:12,Derek Main,@Jane .Blamire I also agree - I think this commission needs to run permanently to continue exposing the corruption to public scrutiny.
1573034947505672,1:58:29,Annalie Elizabeth,Well it is clear that Angus Buchan is not the answer
1573034950241699,1:58:32,MIKE DURBAN,Who noes........maybe the Big Guy In The Sky has a plan for SA...........

1573037064118147,2:33:45,Derek Main,@Suzie Greer Wrong country - he's being extradited to the USA.
1573037082643485,2:34:04,Mbuso Ndlovu,WHO IS JULIAN?????
1573037112385140,2:34:34,Derek Main,@Pastor J No - there was never a charge - he was only requested to give a founding statement. No charges ever laid.
1573037204307987,2:36:06,Aj Otto,Julian Assange 'commited treason' by revealing crimes of government ~ classic tale of Terrorist vs Hero
1573037214611090,2:36:15,Pastor J.J,@Derek Main . I am confused. He holed up in that embassy to avoid extradition on that charge as well as the US charges relative to the Wikileaks issues. I need enlightening
1573037382948694,2:39:04,Derek Main,@Pastor J ... there so that he could be sent to the US for spying charges. The rape charge was simply a ruse.
1573037452598116,2:40:14,Derek Main,@Pastor J He offered to give a deposition in the UK but Sweden refused because that would thwart their plans.
1573037465345784,2:40:27,Aj Otto,"Hmm, scapegoat or fakegoating"
1573037473521817,2:40:35,Pastor J.J,Yoh. All that misery at the embassy because of vindictiveness and anger of some Govt or another. What a messed up world we live in
1573037522360516,2:41:24,Derek Main,@Pastor J Yes - and all because he exposed the truth of what our governments get up to. He's a hero in my book.
1573037568079869,2:42:09,Derek Main,@Pastor J He's now being kept in solitary confinement in UK and is not allowed to prepare his defence or meet lawyers.

1573037953594467,2:48:35,Aj Otto,Are the sa Worker Unions in on the State Capture? that's the biggest question this testimony raised for me so far
1573038080639253,2:50:42,Pastor J.J,@Aj Otto They absolutely are. Cosatu is a member of the Tripartite alliance. Ramaphosa was also the Gen Sec of NUM
