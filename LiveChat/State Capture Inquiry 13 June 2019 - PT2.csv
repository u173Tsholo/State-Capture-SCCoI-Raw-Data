1560428530543068,22:02,DJ DJ,who is speaking now
1560428590844613,23:02,DJ DJ,no arrests will be made like all other problems
1560428596640648,23:07,Ngaletsang Mayet,lot of people in SAA has eaten tax payer s monies
1560428664665963,24:16,Born free,"Yes, SAA always looking for bailouts. The board members of all the State Entities are the corrupt and the implicated."
1560428714902968,25:06,makhosi nobhatyi,Surely we will see people prostituted towards the end of commission
1560428772295145,26:04,Ngaletsang Mayet,Correct Born free its bad that some employees at SAA were given retrenchments packages while politicians are chowing the monies
1560428774960893,26:06,Derek Main,They've already prostituted themselves.
1560428846640992,27:19,Suzanne,"this poor woman tried everything she could to save money and protect SAA, her managers, bosses and other people let her down!"
1560428884902594,27:56,makhosi nobhatyi,NPA is busy now compiling all evidence they might collect and carry on with more investigation to charge those executives and politicians
1560428941213002,28:52,Ngaletsang Mayet,Yes Suzanne those who tried eventually resigned leaving the poor SAA to the hands of looters
1560429004555116,29:56,Suzanne,As citizens in this country we need to keep fighting this anti corruption fight... billions and billions of rands!
1560429082551000,31:13,makhosi nobhatyi,"@suzanne saunders she tried but her voice was ignored, Dudu myeni Zuma was a board chairwoman over powering her, and Guptas and President was interested until FDC strikes which is their plan"
1560429084719211,31:16,Suzanne,"This makes me so angry, the people we trusted with our money and futures and lives have been bleeding us dry because they want to be fat cats while the rest of us can barely afford schooling or petrol"
1560429092328951,31:23,Ngaletsang Mayet,Indeed our infrastructure is collapsing while billions are spend on these SOE s
1560429108771914,31:40,Suzanne,Thats why i am saying... we as citizens should support these people who fight.
1560429161928580,32:34,DJ DJ,truth is so much money is been spent on this commision but yet no-one has been arrested. Is it actually worth it as we all know the truth
1560429180954273,32:52,Suzanne,@makhosi nobhatyi we should help these people. help them fight what they do here is so scary and big
1560429239517554,33:51,Suzanne,"@DJ DJ you can vote for someone else who wont have this power hungry disgusting attitude... and i dont mean a political party. they are all useless, we need to find a different way"
1560429259043486,34:10,Suzanne,Tea time is done... back to work for me 😞
1560429297823372,34:49,DJ DJ,@Suzanne Saunders i did not vote for the ANC
1560429324795674,35:15,Suzanne,Neither did i...
1560429357323427,35:49,Born free,The Guptas had the government in their pockets which led to the enabling and looting of State funds.
1560429379521485,36:11,Suzanne,If we know who funds political parties do you think that it would make a difference? Would you still buy a luxury german car if you know they had given cars to the parliament for something?
1560429489324172,38:00,Sibulelo Marabela,hey mzatsi is very hard here in south afrika
1560429495323455,38:07,Kay Kay,guys don't lose hope let's trust that DCJ Zondo will help all of us by recommending prosecution of those who looted the country
1560429515979672,38:27,Born free,There are more fools out there than there are wise men.
1560429566996586,39:18,Derek Main,@Born free Yes - our elections proved that.
1560429568968702,39:20,Amen Nkosi,i dont think that these commission will help ...
1560429588676537,39:40,Suzanne,"At least people can now see and understand the extent of madness we have been subject to in the last few years. We need to become an educated country and we need to teach ourselves, read and study."
1560429603576435,39:55,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main I doubt that is exclusive derek because on either side of the party divide is a similar sentiment. Maybe both sides can be true simultaneously.
1560429668157363,41:00,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane Perhaps but I base that on the fact the we have heard of all the ANC corruption and the fools still voted for them.
1560429764419127,42:35,Norman Zwane,@Suzanne Saunders You'll be amazed how slow to learn people can be. we lived with a mad apartheid system for decades but there are adults who still have no idea how it damaged everyone. But I see
1560429772848258,42:44,Derek Main,It's not just a thumbsuck or guess - it has been laid bare. Only the ANC fools can't see it.
1560429840524618,43:52,Suzanne,What i can add is that i am always so happy to see people who fight. These whistle-blowers and people like Thuli Madonsela have my utmost respect. These are the bravest people i know!
1560429871839813,44:23,Suzanne,@Norman Zwane why cant you teach people?
1560429899284493,44:50,Born free,This level of corruption has nothing to do with Apartheid but everything to do with Incompetence and greed and a culture of greed.
1560429911597880,45:02,Kay Kay,"Amen Nkosi, why do you think the inquiry will not recommend prosecutions? Are you doubting judge Zondo's abilities to help the country?"
1560430040318774,47:12,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main Yeah. we all take long to learn. Imagine after the Un declared apartheid a crime against humanity and some blunt knives still voted to uphold its proponents, strange slow learners-voters"
1560430050624744,47:21,makhosi nobhatyi,"This commission is different with others that was held before, recommendations Judge will make is binding and goes with prostitution action, that is why NPA is following these proceedings"
1560430106104286,48:17,Derek Main,"@Norman Zwane Totally agree with that - they supported the Nats to the end. So the more things change, the more they stay the same."
1560430144988341,48:56,Derek Main,The ANC have become the Nats.
1560430174508240,49:27,Suzanne,"Apartheid didnt leave anyone unscathed. My dad was stabbed by a protester in 1977 while he was teaching in JHB De Korte street, at a school that accommodated black, white, asian, indian etc."
1560430233900884,50:25,Suzanne,"I still have hope in Ramaphosa, NOT in the ANC, but Ramaphosa as a human being."
1560430261269534,50:52,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi I would love to be able to do that - I just can't see it under an ANC government.
1560430265548462,50:56,Born free,Apartheid remains only with the guilty. Move forward it is nothing but a word of obstruction..
1560430268602301,51:00,Norman Zwane,@Suzanne Saunders Taught experience is trumped by lived experience. Personally my lived experience is to be weary of being in agreement with folks who are not Black.
1560430324420104,51:55,Suzanne,Well perhaps its time to find new experiences...
1560430342719755,52:14,Norman Zwane,@Born free You sure lived on the 'other side of the track'.
1560430350915608,52:22,makhosi nobhatyi,@Moahi hlapolos yes that happened before but this time around things will change those people who have given authority to act law push them to do so. That is why parliament will be investigated
1560430387064735,52:58,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,The makeup artist lady suppose to be in entertainment industry
1560430398663928,53:10,Born free,After 25 years you finally decide to find new experiences. You only live once.. move forward it will lead to progress.
1560430462333937,54:13,Norman Zwane,@Suzanne Saunders Big gamble for me. I have a baggage of experience versus a glimpse of hope. The dice is loaded in favour of my lived experience. wish it was easy to move on.
1560430475108345,54:26,Suzanne,I still have hope in SA - even though we have had a tough past. but you cant move forward if the past hangs like a heavy horrid stone around your neck. @Born free its never to late.
1560430496558762,54:48,Kay Kay,DCJ Zondo is clever he ordered parly to be investigated knowing that by the time his report arrive there isn't watered down
1560430513409256,55:04,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main I am pleading you to watch, support right thing where there is wrong criticize boldly, we are not putting these executives not performing their duties"
1560430514684671,55:06,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane We are all scarred by our lived experience in SA - some more than others.
1560430516136762,55:07,Suzanne,@Norman Zwane i know exactly what you mean. I also have experiences. I think everyone has. Thats what makes this reconciliation so hard.
1560430552903242,55:44,Born free,some people cannot escape their own mental slavery.
1560430565525404,55:56,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Believe me I'll speak my mind. I just feel that we are just kicking the can down the road.
1560430612463968,56:43,Norman Zwane,"@Suzanne Saunders It don't hang like some diamond stone on my neck, it is the very fabric of the life I lived"
1560430651630982,57:23,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@makhosi nobhatyi This brother Derek is in desperate need for help. Find some psychologist please. I am in Cape Town and i guess he's in Gauteng. I would love to help him or connect him with some.
1560430683415992,57:54,Derek Main,"@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU If you have a point to make, please do so."
1560430691366618,58:02,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main from scared to scarred when we start throwing F words around (Fools in your case)
1560430710824369,58:21,Suzanne,"@Norman Zwane not a diamond, a stone... a horrid stone. we all have them somewhere. we all have memories. oh my boss is gonna kill me"
1560430719557772,58:31,Suzanne,ok ok ok back to work now. whahahah
1560430741204998,58:52,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane That was the politetest word I could think of.
1560430775243258,59:26,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main your concern is everyone concerned but we have hope in this administration, Ramaphosa shows leadership when he agreed with what happens was wrong and said we had a chance to fix it once"
1560430786504529,59:37,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@makhosi nobhatyi Its not normal to see someone this negative, everyday! I mean i am not happy at all, everyday about our situation but i don't make noise or spend all day negative like him"
1560430798850868,59:51,Norman Zwane,"@Suzanne Saunders I hate to agree with you, but you are correct. It just gets to me when we lose patience with those who are slow to heal and want to move on."
1560430898803539,1:01:30,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi I'm afraid I don't have your optimism. The rot is too deep.
1560430920946043,1:01:52,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@makhosi nobhatyi Yeah Ramaphosa, never his fan though, has something that says/convince one to trust. I admit. But the BIG problem is, the people around him."
1560430944344935,1:02:16,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main If you are being honest & not sacarstic then I'm afraid you come across as insensitive, but it may just be your lack of vocabulary as you seem to concede yourself."
1560430954741279,1:02:26,Sthakathi Khumalo,Zondo WANTS THE LOO
1560430972502830,1:02:43,Sthakathi Khumalo,hOW IS IT PEOPLE??
1560430982897905,1:02:55,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane What do you think I'm being sarcastic about?
1560430984349252,1:02:56,Felix Muyoba,he is human @Sthakathi Khumalo
1560430992540350,1:03:04,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Derek Main Too deep, thats also my point. But the best is to hope that these fat cats in the governing party will now work. As Ramaphosa wishes or intends doing"
1560431110959597,1:04:25,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main Your application of the word ""FOOLISH"". I doubt that you intended to use it in politenes as you sacarstically claim."
1560431121052641,1:04:35,makhosi nobhatyi,"There is a hope in this administration, minister must clean its own departments and make progress in service delivery that is what president mandate"
1560431162383497,1:05:16,Norman Zwane,@Sthakathi Khumalo 3 Cheers. Umbonile!!
1560431192264782,1:05:47,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane OK - please explain to me how people can riot in the streets against poor service delivery one day and the next vote for the very party failing at service delivery. That's a fool.
1560431286772789,1:07:21,makhosi nobhatyi,"Only one problem I have now Mkhwebane seems she is working for an agent so I don’t trust her she failed twice in her report, wait and see she will fail again"
1560431352148125,1:08:26,Yolo More,"Advocate Hofmeyer is back, which means Maleka is back too. How I missed this pair!!!"
1560431353450922,1:08:28,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane Then they are even more foolish to think those are the only parties they could have voted for.
1560431417571318,1:09:32,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main people protest is our rights to demand these services so that government may improve it, that doesn’t mean we don’t need this government so you need to accept that"
1560431479138879,1:10:33,Derek Main,"@makhosi nobhatyi That doesn't make any sense. Surely you vote for them because you think they are capable of delivering. If they fail, you vote for somebody else. Simple"
1560431480154075,1:10:34,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main well you are correct again, but how futile is all of that because even if you held the elections tomorrow, the outcome would be no different. You have no clue how apartheid scarred folks."
1560431514069440,1:11:08,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane I can definitely see that it messed with education.
1560431516991921,1:11:11,Dean Mtileni,Yo
1560431636099782,1:13:10,Norman Zwane,@Derek Main education? What education? as far as apartheid was concerned we should only have learnt how to take instructions - period.
1560431693190894,1:14:08,Norman Zwane,@Don Johnson Now that slavery is abolished - yes
1560431698741380,1:14:13,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane I agree with you - and the ANC are taking full advantage of that.
1560431795650740,1:15:50,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane Take a look at the education system now. Is it better?
1560431826959388,1:16:21,Born free,",The elections are no different to the elections in Zimbabwe. The ignorant kept voting for the ruling party.. Mugabe's party. despite the fact that their vote made no difference to their lives."
1560431843598138,1:16:38,Muriel Haynes,so was money stolen only came on line know
1560431852678298,1:16:47,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main If I was the ANC I would too, but there some of us who want to show our people that there really is life outside the ANC, that process is slow and is not helped by calling folk FOOLISH"
1560431854840206,1:16:50,makhosi nobhatyi,ANC government is working hard to improve the lives of the poor and better life for all
1560431876756269,1:17:10,Muriel Haynes,really????
1560431910161036,1:17:44,Derek Main,@Norman Zwane I've tried many routes to convince people - I've given up with that. Now I just say it like I see it.
1560431916772109,1:17:52,Norman Zwane,@Don Johnson Lucky fish. In that case are the slaves worth nothing then?
1560431930272244,1:18:05,Born free,In 25 years I have only seen how flawed the ANC is.
1560431976745658,1:18:51,Norman Zwane,"@Derek Main The education, Health, policing, transportation systems are worse today"
1560432007475213,1:19:22,Muriel Haynes,so jow much went into the guptas pocket
1560432028205890,1:19:43,Anne M.,@Don Johnson Go away. Let the adults speak.
