1614344270734954,52:05,Mangalani Mangalani,Zondo is the reason why this commission is behind schedule 
1614344275889559,52:11,Ismail Petersen,"Diane, its understood because doom is the answer for the ants, particularly if the ants hang out in the akward spots inside the pants."

1614344342420956,53:17,Mangalani Mangalani,"He talks slowly, ask repetitive questions. Doesn’t treat witnesses with kid gloves."
1614344416498173,54:31,Victor,@Mangalani Mangalani Kid gloves are only taken off in a court
1614344580283756,57:15,Mangalani Mangalani,@Victor I watched TRC & PIC and others. The chairmen were very firm and straight to the point.
1614344583723912,57:18,Blake Yogi,you werent at your best at being able to deal with yourself??🤯🤯🤯🤯
1614344673794815,58:49,Victor,I guess its differences in personalities..Naturally he wants to be thorough
1614344781146397,1:00:36,xx xx,why is suzanne damiels coming back to testify?
1614344905153492,1:02:40,Heather Durr,'The Peoples President' ugh
1614344906016305,1:02:41,Blake Yogi,@Victor. that aint a guess. thay is a spot on observation
1614344919185106,1:02:54,Stix Mtolo,"@Antoinette Meyer, exactly. Even the return of Tsotsi because most of the evidence sounds repetitive"
1614344952928918,1:03:28,charlie zamile,"@Antoinette Meyer ,l reckoned there're more questions than answers onto her part,a massive of them"
1614344996728592,1:04:11,xx xx,no sanctions when they return for second intervention
1614345009518356,1:04:24,Dan Brown,@Heather Durr - I Tend to Lurk a lot as I am working on many screens at once and only contribute when I am doing a Job boring like watching the paint dry. 😊
1614345062164682,1:05:17,xx xx,sounds like Hamlet's soliloquy

1614345220053720,1:07:55,Jenny Whitewaves,I get the feeling that the legal team thinks ms Daniels is not coming as clean as she could The truth the part truth and the half truth 
1614345311417928,1:09:26,Dan Brown,This Guy is a smoothie at the commission total antithesis of what all the other witnesses describe him in meetings. DCJ is also too friendly with him. The EL is toothless too. Bring Kate back.
1614345358763791,1:10:13,Dan Brown,Nick Lanelle is another smooth Spin Doctor as well IMHO.
1614345366100045,1:10:21,xx xx,"Dan, I echo your sentiment!!!"
1614345451817916,1:11:46,TheQueen V,chair is not satisfied with selekas work

1614345561171485,1:13:36,Teunis van Ree,I believe Seleka's self confidence is slowly eroded by DCJ's interruptions
1614345637512113,1:14:52,Dan Brown,Even Mr Sony 📼😂 Yesterday had more gutzpah !
1614345656052985,1:15:11,Pastor J.J,"@Teunis van Ree Sadly it seems that when ""certain witnesses"" give evidence we tend to see a different side to the DCJ. Am I the only one noticing this?"

1614345854092129,1:18:29,Dan Brown,"He's a lovely guy but too Jovial with some witnesses IMHO, but maybe that's trying to lull them into a false sense of security. He should show some resolve, but then we don't want an aneurysm on TV.🚑"
1614345854600833,1:18:29,TheQueen V,"when seleka is here then chair almost runs the whole show, hardly gives seleka n fair chance to do his work always saying they can move ons or have already covered this and that issue"
1614345861334325,1:18:36,Pastor J.J,@Valencia J That too. Some seem to command more respect than others it seems.

1614345909171242,1:19:24,TheQueen V,"maybe seleka is just a soft guy, people usually take adantage and trample on such people. I use to be a softt until this world made me harder"

1614345946560124,1:20:01,Heather Durr,That is why it takes so long-DCJ interrupts each train of thought leading to a particular point and we go back and round again

1614348421607916,2:01:16,Ndumie Ndlovu,@Pastor JJ let agree to disagree
1614348432622975,2:01:27,Pastor J.J,@Ndumie Ndlovu Hlophe is currently known to be the most untrustworthy Judge. How do you see it differently. I challenge one person on the chat to agree with you.
1614348447752107,2:01:42,Heather Durr,This is not correct subject for re-exam
1614348449994869,2:01:45,Val Speirs,The Gupta's just a family of Conartists.
1614348462097529,2:01:57,Pastor J.J,@Naledi Barron I am on top of it with my Doom in hand
1614348472389605,2:02:07,xx xx,🤕Ndumi
1614348481094056,2:02:16,Heather Durr,The inference is to be drawn by DCJ not subject to re-exam
1614348502696081,2:02:37,Heather Durr,No no no nope
1614348536323740,2:03:11,Heather Durr,He has given his version. THATS IT
1614348554427027,2:03:29,Heather Durr,This is not a civil or criminal court
1614348554876575,2:03:29,Ndumie Ndlovu,@Pastor JJ because that what the WMC does discredit those they can't control classify them as corrupt.. I'm sure as a pastor you familiar with the story of Jesus. they said he was a thief etc
1614348555783679,2:03:30,xx xx,This is all hearsay??
1614348558385502,2:03:33,mkm 23,you they are grilling him

1614348597319125,2:04:12,Val Speirs,Minister Brown
1614348597979739,2:04:13,Heather Durr,No second bite at the cherry on a point that is highly relevant and now he is changing his version
1614348598688366,2:04:13,Gray Lawrence,Thought he only needed 10 minutes.
1614348622530457,2:04:37,Pastor J.J,@Ndumie Ndlovu But Hlophe tried to corrupt the 2 Concourt Judges to favour Zuma. Dont you see that Bro?
