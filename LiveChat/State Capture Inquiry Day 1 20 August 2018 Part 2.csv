1534768687534865,37:22,Mzalwane Mzala,How can this commission be a factional tool against Zuma when he himself has proclaimed it?
1534768729289640,38:04,Stanley Gumza,General Ace is not going anywhere there you are dividing the Anc...
1534768736659460,38:11,Robert Russell,Thiza... Zuma was always the Commander in THIEF....even from the early 70's
1534768737516740,38:12,Mpho Mashigo,yoh yoh yoh... He still is... MK is alive and kicking baba... if a civil war were to break up... ghost will come alive😅😅😅

1534768872567895,40:27,Thiza William,only two commander in chief existed in life of MK Mandela as the first and OR Tambo as the second. MK was disbanded in 1993 before Zuma became a President of the ANC

1534769110372195,44:25,Mandla Norman Krakra,"Too much investigation, doubts and unfinalised verdicts and measures"

1534769134737331,44:49,Thiza William,Zuma is going down..
1534769153856072,45:08,Stanley Gumza,state capture is on indians and blacks not rupert..
1534769170200143,45:25,Thabiso Molefe,some are going to Jail because they know to people to believe on them they must present something near legit. so some will be sacrificed and go to jail
1534769210934645,46:05,Mandla Norman Krakra,Thiza that's true
1534769216492107,46:11,Mpho Mashigo,Gaddafi is hero baba... champion in African development... Africa will be free from economic slavery... the sleeping giant is awakening🤗🤗🤗
