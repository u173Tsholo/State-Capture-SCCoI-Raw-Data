1601979177668149,2:12:49,SanFran Arnold,There was no wrongdoing on any of the exec's part. They just needed Gupta stooges in
1601979189755423,2:13:00,Naledi Barron,True dat @Jenny Whitewaves

1601979346363930,2:15:37,ALTA,what does this guy know🤔
1601979353890749,2:15:43,Anne M.,@Naledi Barron Hello. Nice to see you back on the chat.

1601979390542250,2:16:21,Lezil Lezil,somethings cooking here. DCJ appear very unsettled today
1601979417116483,2:16:47,ALTA,true sanb
1601979435327708,2:17:06,Jenny Whitewaves,It's lawyer training you don't ask the defendant you are defending if they are telling the truth so that they can't say you didn't do your best for them
1601979444491725,2:17:15,Lezil Lezil,breaking news gonna be a shocker
1601979444557347,2:17:15,SanFran Arnold,"The first sign of dodgy dealings, was him being called to fix an Eskimo problem by the SAA chair."
1601979457213257,2:17:27,SanFran Arnold,@Jenny Whitewaves exactly
1601979482165891,2:17:51,Xolani J Masemula,"honestly speaking this is a tough one cause Eskom was always a failing company,"
1601979484548419,2:17:53,ALTA,anne agree
1601979512142193,2:18:22,SanFran Arnold,"DCJ cannot handle the fact that he not only being a lawyer, but a magistrate, could stand by and not ask why am I here. Eskom had a board, he was not needed"
1601979513949592,2:18:23,Yolo More,Nicholas is remorseless
1601979515906485,2:18:25,Xolani J Masemula,"it's hard to say there was no. need for an audit,"
1601979519301107,2:18:29,Lee D. Hendrix,...The pop-up suspensions just happened because the president and dudu were loading their money into varing containers to China.
1601979519998640,2:18:29,ALTA,yessss chair yessss!!!!!@
1601979529562183,2:18:40,Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ,"..btw, what's happening with SAA?"
1601979536574853,2:18:46,Jenny Whitewaves,@SanFran Arnold need to go further back than that there is something about the water dept in I think EC
1601979538976990,2:18:50,Lezil Lezil,minister brown must come back here
1601979556496759,2:19:07,SanFran Arnold,@Xolani J Masemula Eskom was not always a failing SOE. We had the cheapest electricity for years and then it was overrun by looters
1601979569133895,2:19:18,Anne M.,Yes @Yolo More . Pretending that he did nothing wrong.
1601979576238862,2:19:26,ALTA,mr k still waiting saa for buyers
1601979597521158,2:19:46,SanFran Arnold,@Jenny Whitewaves water affairs has everything to do with Nomvula Mokonyane and that has to be answered as well
1601979617213300,2:20:07,Tommygun,@SanFran Arnold Its the old case of SOEsand Municipalities not having the capability/work ethic of running things and calling in consultants to do their job.
1601979631106507,2:20:21,Naledi Barron,"@SanFran Arnold Precisely. Before the looters came along, ESKOM was one of the finest, reliable and dependable service providers in the country, and was a world-class organisation."
1601979631751305,2:20:21,Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ,"No, Eskom - According to my knowledge - sold electricity accross the boarder to Mozambique..which supports China ( I'm still observing here)"

1601979667909203,2:20:58,ALTA,gerhard.... yes
1601979679583068,2:21:10,SanFran Arnold,"@Tommygun exactly. the capacity is not numbers, the capacity is the ability to do the job. So nobody that was hired could do the job. Look at the ANC calling in Bell-Pottinger"
1601979685751492,2:21:15,Jenny Whitewaves,@SanFran Arnold this guy first became an adviser to Dudu in some stuff about water before SAA
1601979698407891,2:21:28,SanFran Arnold,@Xolani J Masemula wise word choice post 94...
1601979698714855,2:21:28,Tommygun,How do you talk about problems with suspended executives?
1601979719111406,2:21:49,Nodza Sigaar,when baba dudu came in can't wait
1601979724241882,2:21:54,Xolani J Masemula,"if you look at the damage to the Grid and the state of the stations, it takes way more years of corruption to get to where Eskom is,"
1601979731299463,2:22:01,SanFran Arnold,"@Jenny Whitewaves yes he was her ""fixer"" in the KZN area water board. He has walked a long path with her"

1601979765976585,2:22:36,Jenny Whitewaves,We need to know what he had to fix for her then
1601979771149141,2:22:41,SanFran Arnold,@Naledi Barron thanks hun
1601979777034346,2:22:47,Tommygun,Argument might be that no sane person specially with legal background would have suspended the board members
1601979788990704,2:22:58,Yolo More,Nic was pushing Atul Gupta's agenda
1601979804875896,2:23:15,Anne M.,Yup
1601979819066926,2:23:30,rohan barnard,he was the fixer and dudu was the blesser
1601979840155384,2:23:50,SanFran Arnold,@Tommygun that is the argument that DCJ is struggling with being the second highest judge in our land
1601979870827857,2:24:20,Sal SA,"@Jenny Linell's brief was to remove the executives, and clear the way for wreckers in chief Me"
1601979874227646,2:24:24,SanFran Arnold,@rohan barnard she was blessed by her blesser
1601979886105143,2:24:35,Xolani J Masemula,"honestly if you look at the amount of electricity that is ""stolen"" there is no way Eskom is generation a profit, not for a long time,"
1601979886790826,2:24:36,Jenny Whitewaves,How important was it that Escom failed to push the nuclear option because of Russian bribes and the Guptas uranium holdings
1601979892663450,2:24:42,SanFran Arnold,@Sal SA hello
1601979903578757,2:24:52,rohan barnard,@SanFran Arnold jacob dudu with myeni zuma

1601979943542714,2:25:34,Tommygun,"@Xolani J Masemula True, but not the issue right now."
1601979983400676,2:26:12,Yolo More,Because they were persuaded by the legal advisor aka mr fixer
1601979996479998,2:26:26,Tommygun,I think Dudu was the fixer and Linnell was the legal rubber stamper.
1601979996703199,2:26:27,Sal SA,@Jenny ... chief Molefe as acting CE and Anoj Singh CFO. They facilitated take over of Optimum coal mine n payments to the Gupta's
1601980062252113,2:27:32,Xolani J Masemula,"@Tommy Gun, I'm just saying that makes it difficult to point this guy as a corrupt ""fixer"" when there was in actual fact a problem,"

1601980557758320,2:35:47,Gerard Victor,@Sal: Indeed-start with his bank account then sell off all his properties and cars. Should be able to make a healthy sum back with interest
1601980560858207,2:35:51,Linda James,My theory is that RET is a FARCE.....It is used to escape culpability for their covetousness @Tommygun
1601980572266611,2:36:02,Rene Ngwenya,Now the electricity makes the pot becoming hot!!!

1601980751527454,2:39:01,Gerard Victor,This man is giving evidence from an empty room with the echo
1601980763485785,2:39:13,SanFran Arnold,@Yolo More exactly he must tell them if he ate the curry
1601980776126833,2:39:26,Samuel Skosana,"Keep up the pressure advocate, he is buckling now"

1601980840299320,2:40:31,Tommygun,"So was it Linnells idea to suspend or was it someone elses? If it was his it was a crap idea, if he was told...."
1601980842215513,2:40:33,Rip Torn,He cooked his own goose
1601980843839299,2:40:34,Tappies Smit,This moegoe is hiding somewhere so that it will be difficult to arrest him..that explained the empty room.
1601980845502120,2:40:36,Xolani J Masemula,"""those people needed to be"" then corrects himseelf"
1601980852009056,2:40:40,Yolo More,He must not breath Advocate Seleka.
1601980861554942,2:40:51,SanFran Arnold,Linnell knows that he was brought in as a farce. The whole thing was done way before by the Gupta's
1601980883981321,2:41:14,Samuel Skosana,Go for the jugular now adv Seleka
1601980891873153,2:41:21,Sal SA,Linell must have made a lot of money from the Gupta's - was aink in the corruption chain at SAA n Eskom
1601980904621121,2:41:35,Sal SA,a link
1601980953643295,2:42:23,Buyani Mhlongo,@Xolani J Masemula Yes Xolani and its bleeding really bad lol
1601980964399821,2:42:35,Tommygun,"Clearly his opinion, clearly a crap consultant/legal mind."
1601980993346378,2:43:04,SanFran Arnold,Dudu brought in a non Gupta fixer so as to cover her trails. He is complicit in the wrongdoings but he is not an exact wrongdoer
1601980996070707,2:43:07,Mondli Nohashe,No waste of time. This one is supposed to sleep behind bars today
1601980998764457,2:43:09,Rip Torn,He is a shoe shine boy

1601981062405646,2:44:12,Henriette Cowley,Tappies Smit 100%
1601981103566094,2:44:54,Tebogo Sibilanga,This country will continue to regress under the corrupt leadership of the comrades.
1601981109234734,2:44:59,makhosi nobhatyi,"Nowonder why this investigation was happening silently and private, surely this was hidden from ANC. Zuma has President should have appoint people publicly not this, he must go to jai"
1601981122045000,2:45:12,SanFran Arnold,Eskom owes 500mil in debt far from being a cash cow. It has been depleted of cash by Zuma and the Gupta's. What we need now is international investment for the betterment of local South Africans
1601981126396263,2:45:16,Rip Torn,@Tappies Smit - I noted that earlier - correct
1601981132218694,2:45:22,Sal SA,@SanFran I think he knew exactly the damage he'll cause. Totally complicit
1601981155867174,2:45:47,Mohamed Mia,@tappies maybe in his bunker🤣
1601981175664346,2:46:06,Tappies Smit,This moegoe is trying to justify his actions to clear his name from wrong doing...he is a looter like zuma and his cronies.

1601981216384937,2:46:45,SanFran Arnold,"@Sal SA he should have asked the questions instead of just doing, but he was doing what he always did for Dudu."
1601981219567849,2:46:50,Sal SA,Services were terminated- job done!!!!
1601981242333704,2:47:12,Henriette Cowley,Mohamed Mia 😄😄

1601981251371601,2:47:21,Naledi Barron,"It's simple. Guptas & Dudu stole Eskom. Zuma had to 'protect' his family from investigation, so he appointed weaklings and compromised individuals. Anyone opposing Zuma got the 'golden handshake'"

1601981255657325,2:47:26,Tommygun,He whitwashed it
1601981262639964,2:47:32,SanFran Arnold,How can they do that if he did not have a contract to do any work at all?
1601981263878288,2:47:34,Will,Adv Seleka = LEGEND!!!

1601981413057567,2:50:03,Anne M.,@Syug Do you mean Dudu Myeni? Yesterday Linnell spoke about his long relationship with Myeni as a consultant.
1601981413237691,2:50:03,Mondli Nohashe,@Sal SA only Dudu can know
1601981416390582,2:50:07,Will,This guy disagrees with everything. No wonder he were not allowed to be a lawyer in zimbabwe
1601981423582266,2:50:14,Pastor J.J,@SanFran Arnold Hello Darling. Is that really your middle name? No offence meant
1601981431607913,2:50:23,Cerebis,Was this guy Myeni's Bag man? He seem to have followed her on her devious project in the SOE's?
1601981432803022,2:50:24,Naledi Barron,@CYRIL NDABA Don't forget ConCourt Judge Kriegler!
1601981435993487,2:50:26,Rene Ngwenya,@ CYRIL NDABA please dont forget Adv Notshe. I simply love watching his absolute competence too at leading evidence.
1601981446041665,2:50:36,R.m. B.,Anyone know what happened to the last hour of ZC streaming yesterday? Censorship??
1601981447104530,2:50:37,Angelo Doubel,@Cyril. no Adv Notshe and Pretoruis. Their cases infront of a judge. Vincent Smith and asbestos

1601981493878283,2:51:24,Pastor J.J,@Thobani Mkananda Thank you my Dear friend
1601981505778046,2:51:35,SanFran Arnold,@R.m. B. it was cancelled due to the storm and technical issues
1601981507451670,2:51:37,Xolani J Masemula,"@Makhosi obviously they no longer had need for his services after firing the execs, but firing him was a premature play on the Zuma side,"
1601981545090830,2:52:15,Pastor J.J,@SanFran Arnold Special. So now I dont have to think about that famous Nanny anymore. hahahahaha
1601981549772743,2:52:21,SanFran Arnold,Linnell was a front for the actual goings on behind the scene
1601981551457522,2:52:23,Rip Torn,Lynne Brown should be next in the hot seat
1601981553956180,2:52:25,Sam Monkoe,@R.m. B. Apparently JHB weather was so bad it interfered with Linnells internet connection so it had to be adjourned.
1601981554799893,2:52:26,Thobani Mkananda,@Pastor JJ 🙏🏾💙😁
1601981564159584,2:52:34,Aubrey De Bliquy,"@R.m. B. No, but if it's SABC News you can be sure they have conveniently timed failures like when Scale of harms evidence was being introduced at the Trial of the Dagga Plant in Pretoria."

1601981635322599,2:53:45,Naledi Barron,@Pastor J.J Just missing @ValenciaJ
1601981643556134,2:53:54,Rene Ngwenya,I think this former Rhodesian advocate is angry at that excommunication especially because he was so actively involved at all levels as the fixer.
1601981652466358,2:54:04,Xolani J Masemula,"give us names Linell, you are a small fish in a big pond,"
1601981671638815,2:54:21,SanFran Arnold,@Sal SA exactly. Brown was told to force his ousting so it could not come back to her and her president
1601981679169068,2:54:30,Aubrey De Bliquy,These parasites hide behind Apartheid racism while they suck the life out of the country hurting the poor the most.
1601981683480152,2:54:34,Thobani Mkananda,@Aubrey De Bliquy are you in way related to the champion for marijuana freedom?
1601981689567324,2:54:38,Pastor J.J,@Naledi Barron I suspect she might just be that Goat that pays us the occassional rare visit

1601981767343023,2:55:56,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Thobani Mkananda Dagga prohibition is the last remaining Apartheid law. WHO cannot find their original document justifying prohibition because it exposes the hand of the Apartheid regime.
1601981767464905,2:55:57,Anne M.,@Rene Ngwenya Probably also the fat pay check he was getting.

1601981827043408,2:56:57,Jacqui Baumgardt,@Angelo Doubel I also want to know

1601982169403342,3:02:39,Yolo More,Long explanations to buy all the time left.
1601982171493905,3:02:41,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Thobani Mkananda It is unregulated predatory capitalism of fiat money. Apartheid was never the main instrument of control. It just co-opted whites into an evil system that still hurts us all today.
1601982174965473,3:02:46,Mondli Nohashe,Zondo is ready for lunch & next witness
1601982216122556,3:03:26,Lee D. Hendrix,...Phone data records are the bindings from persons who wish to be clandestine.

1601982262265583,3:04:12,Rip Torn,Hier kom n lang storie/Here comes a long story
1601982268869301,3:04:18,ALTA,rohan and elvis was earlier here pastor

1601982335658467,3:05:25,Thobani Mkananda,@Aubrey De Bliquy Interesting! Was or is capitalism the main culprit then?
1601982347794016,3:05:38,Tefo Moneri,Bad witness. he is a gonner
1601982356173374,3:05:46,Naledi Barron,That sound (the Hadidas) means that Linell is near a river/water
1601982396699899,3:06:26,Tommygun,"@Lucky Benya Not so bad, hes directly implicated Dudu as a liar and implicated Zuma in proceedings"
1601982432978494,3:07:03,SanFran Arnold,@Tommygun exactly
1601982450669133,3:07:22,Rip Torn,A meaningless role
1601982457165667,3:07:26,Rene Ngwenya,I am glad that suspicions tthe nation had that some loadshedding was unnecessary was true... outages were planned so that the looters could benefit from more diesel consumption at some plants.
1601982477776843,3:07:48,Lee D. Hendrix,...He's a Scribe........
1601982487458207,3:07:56,Mondli Nohashe,@Tommygun. is the implicated Zuma coming back ?
1601982492526932,3:08:03,Owen Nyilika,Waste of our money advices from NICOLA
1601982543836028,3:08:53,Tommygun,@Mondli Nohashe I believe hes been politely asked to come back 🙂
1601982544287590,3:08:54,Andre G,Things were wrong in areas as you wanted to make space for a GUPTA Board at Eskom - you and Dudu...
1601982546921639,3:08:56,Naledi Barron,"In my dreams, I go hunting for all these B*****ds!!"
1601982567065473,3:09:17,Aubrey De Bliquy,The business doctrine is amoral unaccountable profit that gives us Imasi at Pick'n Pay local stores feeding the poorest squatter camps at twice the price I get it from my local Giant Hyper.
1601982573083821,3:09:22,Rip Torn,Zondo is underlying the fact Linnell 's services was a waste of money and time
1601982587769734,3:09:36,Tommygun,He just set up the suspensions and rubber stamped it.
1601982595281064,3:09:45,Lady T,The way the ruling party shredded our country to bits with no valo nogal and only thinking about their greedy selves😥😫😥😌!!
1601982619659976,3:10:09,Tommygun,Once the board had their suspensions and media release they could carry on
1601982632990905,3:10:22,Tommygun,Without Linnell
1601982634927066,3:10:24,Lee D. Hendrix,@SanFran Arnold; yes
1601982636635324,3:10:26,Naledi Barron,@Rip Torn Well observed. Let's bring on the REAL thieving b*****ds!
1601982639790112,3:10:29,roza,mr zondo just tell him he was used as a doormat
1601982640013187,3:10:30,Lady T,Where are my usual suspects to give me the download🙆🏾‍♀️😥??
1601982641981379,3:10:31,Abdul Khan,"I think Zondo wants to see what kink he has to ""Businessman"""
1601982649068495,3:10:38,Aubrey De Bliquy,Unregulated Free Market Capitalism is undoubtedly an evil predator that created inequality by design.
1601982668516810,3:10:58,Rene Ngwenya,"The scourge of capitalist greed! So sad our ""socialist"" orientated state could not care for the poor."
1601982670065562,3:10:59,Mondli Nohashe,@Tommygun. I hope Zuma will come back because he is at the centre of everything
1601982676873552,3:11:06,Andre G,This Linnell is thick skinned as a Rhino - He costed the country millions in packages paid to the suspended guys.....
1601982679977308,3:11:11,Rip Torn,The public is starting to demand retribution - now!
1601982680356262,3:11:12,Lady T,@Naledi Barron where have been moghel and hope you keeping warm in the miserable weather😌😊!
1601982693097220,3:11:23,Naledi Barron,"@Aubrey De Bliquy But when Free Market Capitalism is regulated, then it isn't really free is it?"
1601982703255066,3:11:34,LYD online tv,So he's sitting in ZIM?
1601982709842337,3:11:40,Buyani Mhlongo,@Roza essack True doormat x100
1601982713244835,3:11:43,Angelo Doubel,@Andre Geldenhuys yep. Zuma use Dudu to do his dirty work. thats how mafias operate
1601982726617780,3:11:56,Tommygun,"@Mondli Nohashe We all due, but hes asked Zondo to not be involved....maybe he gets Mogeng instead 🙂"
1601982732023617,3:12:03,Thobani Mkananda,@Aubrey De Bliquy I would be happy to read your opinion piece on those points and more. Would that be a fair desire which you wouldn't mind satisfying?
1601982736783380,3:12:06,Naledi Barron,"@Lady T Sorry darling! Yup, all wrapped up here. You ok?"
1601982764416301,3:12:34,SanFran Arnold,"Capitalism is the payment for services rendered, in a free market to get what you want for a price decided upon. A model that is not evil."
1601982777063185,3:12:45,Tebogo Sibilanga,This one has a number of short courses in corruption enablement
1601982781828852,3:12:51,Angelo Doubel,@LadyT welcome back

1601982836503883,3:13:45,Awdi Maharaj,He was there to strengthen the 30 year service level agreements that the National party signed with the SADC before the end of apartheid.
1601982836611841,3:13:46,Ryan Anthony,"enquiry for what? investigate, charge and prosecute...this is just a corruption talk show"
1601982837621230,3:13:47,Rene Ngwenya,He was not a bystander to corruption. He knew about it and enabled decisions.
1601982837925227,3:13:47,Tay,"“My Lords, then there is the shadowy figure of Mr Nick Linnell, a ‘Mr Fix It’ who in the late 1970s operated in the illegal racist white minority regime of Ian Smith in then Rhodesia…”"

1601982850407242,3:14:02,Andre G,"@SanFran Arnold Not capitalisms fault - it is dishonesty, corruption and fraud. There are many of capitalist countries in the word doing well and socialist countries failing"
1601982855313385,3:14:05,Buyani Mhlongo,Zuma is DONE
1601982861089098,3:14:10,Tommygun,"@SanFran Arnold Not a bad model but needs a fair bit of tweaking, specially for ZA"
1601982864390916,3:14:14,SanFran Arnold,Very interesting as to how he showed things happened. It puts the president in a compromising position - interference
1601982873829082,3:14:24,Rene Ngwenya,There will be no lunch.
1601982880873662,3:14:30,logan nair,DCJ pls do not fall for delaying tactics by some guys.
1601982894467865,3:14:44,Tommygun,@SanFran Arnold Better than the faux Socialism tho!
1601982900878327,3:14:52,Yolo More,Yhooo! This man doesnt want to come out of that toilet
1601982910681013,3:15:01,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Thobani Mkananda That would be my pleasure and privilege. So much better than preaching to an antagonistic audience.

1601982949529138,3:15:38,Tommygun,So often the most interesting testimony comes right at the close...
1601982949900774,3:15:38,Naledi Barron,@Andre Geldenhuys True dat. It is the manipulation of capitalism that causes the damage. And Communism isn't Socialism. Too many labels. Too few grass roots straight shooting!
1601982952130138,3:15:41,Thobani Mkananda,@SanFran Arnold Which means in your capitalism is amoral? What then would you suggest was behind the apartheid spirit? CC: @Aubrey De Bliquy

1601982997151218,3:16:27,Aubrey De Bliquy,I take no joy in joining the witch hunt attacking our leaders. We need them to succeed and we pray for their success even when they are not of our chosen party affiliation.
1601983000739542,3:16:31,Andre G,South Africa must be the MOST corrupt country in the world - nail this guy - he thinks he was the boss of Eskom - Imagine you work for him and he is a bully and demands all the time...
1601983025455760,3:16:55,Rene Ngwenya,Why now wake up at the end when lunch is to be served?
1601983028008736,3:16:57,Thobani Mkananda,@Yolo More is the a media house that would appreciate @Aubrey De Bliquy's views?

1601983051211022,3:17:21,Tay,Nick Linnell was the 'Mr Fix-It' for Dudu Myeni.
1601983053412327,3:17:23,Lady T,@Andre Geldenhuys South Africa is better than Nigeria and Zimbabwe.
1601983068554750,3:17:39,Francoise Phillips,He is very vague about all these supposed companies he has worked for and his actual experience.
1601983069153571,3:17:40,Naledi Barron,@Andre Geldenhuys Been in a situation where I blew the whistle. It was...... interesting to observe the reaction.
1601983071042044,3:17:41,Rene Ngwenya,please go before he calls you back.
