1551781472287304,2:34:52,Indoda Yamaqiniso,More jails and even more money to keep them in jail. You must be special kind of stupid. do you know how much does it cost the state to run prison settlements?
1551781487369478,2:35:08,Desmond Masilela,@Felix Muyoba. Lets hope so because this man is trying to hide the truth.
1551781501579844,2:35:22,Felix Muyoba,"hau, 728 million?"
1551781550331927,2:36:11,Derek Main,"@Indoda Yamaqiniso Besides executing them, what's the alternative?"
1551781555475893,2:36:16,Desmond Masilela,Haiiiboooo!!!! another 728m except 659m!!!!
1551781611490822,2:37:11,Bridgette Kekana,wow so much money
1551781618212939,2:37:18,Indoda Yamaqiniso,Sending a person to prison for stealing money is a stupid thing to do as you will pump more money to maintain him/her.
1551781647780361,2:37:58,Gabisile Mabuza,the 728 million includes the 659 million
1551781659495245,2:38:15,Indoda Yamaqiniso,I bet that's why we chose not to send Apartheid criminals to prison.
1551781690602074,2:38:45,Desmond Masilela,So you mean they must just leave them? with no arrest?
1551781719594139,2:39:14,Talloolah Moon,Indoda what‚Äôs your alternative suggestion
1551781720006724,2:39:14,Indoda Yamaqiniso,"I do not mean anything, I just said what I said without meaning anything."
1551781725024847,2:39:24,TOM√ÅS GAMER,they will never be arrested?

1551781771912873,2:40:11,Desmond Masilela,Then what is this commission for if no arrest will be done.
1551781794032380,2:40:34,Felix Muyoba,"exactly, a CA and senior person?"
1551781794247628,2:40:34,Charles Nkadimeng,He was going to be fired

1551782203766496,2:47:49,Talloolah Moon,Thought
1551782221953242,2:48:11,Indoda Yamaqiniso,While the family rejoices that the killer of Reeva Steenkamp goes to prison and justice is being served; the reality says the killer is being rehabilitated with state money.
1551782223719265,2:48:13,Sthakathi Khumalo,He was indebt and needed money this one!!
1551782234276993,2:48:24,Rob Withers,"No one can say that there was a lack of discipline at Eskom, the bosses were respected and the staff carried out illegal instructions without delay."
1551782237105229,2:48:27,Indoda Yamaqiniso,Just a typical example right there.
1551782243031439,2:48:32,Sofia Sofia,I think if he spoke the truth he might have made sense .....
1551782282845426,2:49:10,welton paulse,@Sofia Sofia very much true

1551782372815618,2:50:43,Sofia Sofia,Did he resign from his position ?
1551782374862654,2:50:45,welton paulse,"@Michael Rijsmus I said it this morning, he looks like Mo Shaik"

1551782391247389,2:51:07,Sofia Sofia,Or did he continue knowing what was happening ?
1551782437320033,2:51:53,Sthakathi Khumalo,He was following instructions he says!!
