1566983619399215,2:11:20,Sindiswa Moolman,I’m with you on that one @makhosi nobhatyi.
1566983654758145,2:11:54,Raven Penny,when you have so many children and and extended families like these in government your pay will never be enough

1566983829792099,2:14:51,Sindiswa Moolman,Did Mxolisi confessed his sins? I suspect he’s not innocent in this whole saga. It’s just that the Guptas stopped trusting him and instructed Ace to fire him.
1566983831797133,2:14:53,Jack Sparrow,Restore the dinosaurs!
1566983844631907,2:15:04,Salmaan Abrahams,you must want the majority to be free from the shackles of poverty

1566983880071545,2:15:40,Derek Main,@Salmaan Abrahams That's what we expected the ANC govt to deal with. They chose to line their pockets instead.
1566983887203549,2:15:47,funicanz,So he is not innocent. That's given.
1566983903419956,2:16:03,Salmaan Abrahams,but you dnt deserve equality @Ryan Smith

1566984563785234,2:27:04,Ruan Niemann,"Salmaan Abrahams, your stance is reflective of an ongoing victim mentality and entitlement culture. willfully ignorant of opportunities given solely to the poor victims of the past."
1566984578529977,2:27:19,Salmaan Abrahams,@MIKE LOCK my own grandparents lad was STOLEN!!

1566984903283188,2:32:44,Derek Main,"@Thando Nkutha How am I supporting racism? I'm not saying the apartheid we have now is identical to what it was previously but right now, whites are being unfairly discriminated against."
1566984903458352,2:32:44,Sindiswa Moolman,Mna would @Ryan Smith.

1566984937430150,2:33:17,Jabu Nhlanhla,penny apartheid has nothing to do with this
1566984948040896,2:33:28,Salmaan Abrahams,@Derek Main have you seen a sign saying blacks only?
1566984952519212,2:33:31,Maria Namulindwa,so interesting
1566984961771744,2:33:42,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I know I'm not racist - I couldn't care less if you called me one.
1566984988939690,2:34:10,Raven Penny,its not about the job its about accountability
1566984989291817,2:34:10,Jack Sparrow,I've seen lots of job adverts saying blacks only
1566984991422774,2:34:12,Salmaan Abrahams,"@Derek Main has your parents been made to address a black child as ""baas""?"
1566985008871490,2:34:29,Derek Main,@Salmaan Abrahams Please see my reply to Thando - I never said the situations are identical - only that whotes are now unfairly discriminated against based on skin colour.
1566985020208018,2:34:40,MmeBosso,@Jack Sparrow LIES

1566985079018964,2:35:38,funicanz,"@Thando Nkutha , phuma pha ke @Derek Main. Khaphe mna lo energy 😉"
1566985091381712,2:35:51,Sindiswa Moolman,For me @Raven Penny... it’s about the jobs and whether they can deliver to all SAns. We have enough institutions that can hold them accountable.
1566985108396605,2:36:08,Salmaan Abrahams,@Derek Main it only seems so because we look from where we at not how we came here
1566985126428678,2:36:26,MIKE DURBAN,@Jack Sparrow ....isn't that Racist........
1566985144780339,2:36:45,Derek Main,"@Salmaan Abrahams I have no issue with restitution and agree that it must happen. However, white children, who were never part of apartheid are now at a disadvantage because they are white."
1566985163400075,2:37:03,MIKE DURBAN,So who are the Racists now.........thought we were over that .....
1566985181023946,2:37:21,Jack Sparrow,@MIKE LOCK there are currently more racist laws in the country than there were in the apartheid days
1566985204629794,2:37:46,Salmaan Abrahams,@Derek Main this is an unfortunate predicament but those kids are still born into an advantage brought about by apartheid
1566985233003904,2:38:13,Salmaan Abrahams,@Ruan Niemann 34
1566985261223381,2:38:41,MIKE DURBAN,@Salmaan Abrahams ...Shame Bra...can see you bitter and twisted....Get Over It Bra........live going forwards.....it's the Only way...ne..
1566985261639922,2:38:42,Derek Main,@Salmaan Abrahams So you are justifying unfair discrimination based on race. That's what apartheid was.
1566985261935871,2:38:42,Thulani Bukani,"that's what we did in '94 @Ryan Smith. well at least the blacks did, I'm not sure how much the whites meant it."
1566985263654082,2:38:44,Jabu Nhlanhla,yes abel
1566985273162824,2:38:52,Jack Sparrow,"People in america are also ""born into advantage"". Let's destroy them all"
1566985277156793,2:38:57,Salmaan Abrahams,@Ruan Niemann one does not need to be old to learn objectively
1566985281495608,2:39:01,Ruan Niemann,i thought so. virtue signalling social justice warrior greedy for what you can get.
1566985315927734,2:39:36,makhosi nobhatyi,Thabo Manyoni when is coming to testify?
1566985324104257,2:39:44,Pastor J.J,Racism in any form is hurtful and shameful. Indulging in racism is equally shameful. Discussing the impact of racism is another issue altogether but must be constructive and progressive.
1566985344522765,2:40:05,MIKE DURBAN,But Salmaan.......You don't seem to be Learning......ne
1566985382066794,2:40:42,Salmaan Abrahams,@Derek Main im saying that the majority do not have the most basic amenities and those who are born into advantage still wants to cry fowl at an attempt to rectify
1566985382390542,2:40:43,Wildthing,you all fighting each other while the employees of government are stealing peoples future and each time they want to divert attention they push the race thing. start focusing on good and bad.
1566985397464292,2:40:57,Ruan Niemann,i get on with all people who take responsibility for their own lives.
1566985408070901,2:41:09,MmeBosso,@Jack Sparrow they dont say designated...they say disadvantaged papi

1566985447248992,2:41:47,Jack Sparrow,"No, @Gugulethu Makhalemele, the say ""designated"". I sit on many selection committees"
1566985477986899,2:42:18,Raven Penny,is there only two races in sa
1566985486350570,2:42:27,Cerebis,BEE Laws identify all South africans excluding white men as previously disadvantaged.
1566985522097212,2:43:02,Derek Main,@Salmaan Abrahams My problem is that you try to paint all whites with the same brush. There are many whites who want exactly what you want - that poverty should be dealt with. That is racist.
1566985537521101,2:43:17,Sindiswa Moolman,Some of us will do anything to make sure that our kids get the best education. The question to all involved ... the Morakes and then now is whether it was worth it.
1566985554229320,2:43:35,MmeBosso,"@Jack Sparrow But to my knowledge black ppl are not the only race out here... they are indians, coloureds not black only. Never will there be a blacks only thing."

1566985852213808,2:48:32,Singi Mathebula,nothing left? where did Ace get the money?
1566985863140428,2:48:43,Salmaan Abrahams,@Ryan Smith go learn my brother
1566985871099229,2:48:51,Salmaan Abrahams,please go learn
1566985921053815,2:49:40,Salmaan Abrahams,@Ryan Smith you need capital to become a successful entrepreneur

1566986020640568,2:51:20,Wildthing,Salmann that is not true you need a good business case to raise money from investors or banks. not the other way around.
1566986036057521,2:51:36,Cerebis,Some headlines in SA today: SA EXPRESS CANCELS SEVERAL FLIGHTS FOR OPERATIONAL REASONS
