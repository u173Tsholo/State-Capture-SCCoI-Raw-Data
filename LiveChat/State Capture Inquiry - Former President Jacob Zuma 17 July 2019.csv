1563349661372768,-16:56,Joseph Akwa,No surprises here - you remember the taped conversation btwn him and the former Public Protector - which he had always denied did not happen? Well take your pick.

1563350290678085,-6:26,fefe Mtshokotsha,some people act as if spies/enemies were never there or given post before Zuma became president.I wonder National Party members who end up being part of Anc.Under how's watch did that happen?
