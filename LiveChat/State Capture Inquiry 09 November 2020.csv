1604914929186374,1:40:28,Jenny Whitewaves,@Mike Clark I don't think he will use the Dudu method His lawyers are much better to let him incriminate himself by not answering. He will talk and talk and say nothing
1604914931182067,1:40:30,Pastor J.J,@Barnie Huysamer No. They were born close to each other but thats were the similarities end. It was definately Elvis. hahahahahaha
