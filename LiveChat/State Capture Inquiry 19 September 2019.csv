1568881821489784,49:49,Sthakathi Khumalo,Zondo is not fair to this woman indeed and it’s obvious. In the spirit of gaining experience this is not how it’s done!! The viewers can see iit also!!
1568881922882918,51:31,Paul Buchel,"@Manzi Iznam, in every department, SAA, Eskom SABC, and all town counsels. The HR departments are employing cousins , uncles, with no knowledge at all. False CV's, that's why this country is stuffed."
1568881976945290,52:26,Derek Main,I think Zondo is a bit harsh on Adv September but she also seems to be quite feisty too. Maybe they have some kind of history?
1568882160956838,55:29,Francoise Phillips,More SABC sabotage with the sound. The SABC is corrupt and useless.
1568882203339718,56:11,Keith Hodgson,SABC competency is zero.

1568882376483177,59:05,Derek Main,"@Sthakathi Khumalo I agree - not pleasant to watch or dignified. Perhaps if she just bit the bullet and didn't react, he would calm down a bit."
1568882440283012,1:00:08,welton paulse,SABC is like that one special uncle which we all have
1568882448488686,1:00:17,Mangalani Mangalani,Adv September & Adv Norman are both not Zondo’s favorites
1568882531697759,1:01:40,Derek Main,"@Mangalani Mangalani I think Adv Norman gets nervous and starts bumbling when Zondo criticises her. If he didn't do that, she would probably perform a lot better."
