1543480383202959,25:20,les gp,"I like how this enquiry is focussed only on the last 10 years. Carolus forgets that Coleman Andrews is the very reason why the SAA is what it is today, and that was during Saki's time."

1543480419283911,25:56,les gp,And that was during the Mbeki years

1543480749945528,31:27,Munyaradzi Nherera,A well structured intro that harnessed me from going to the next you tube video. Oppressors were wrestled and defeated only for the country to be handed over to the Guptas.

1543480918968292,34:16,Lihle Sokapase,Fils needs urgent psychological help. He is seeking attention in the wrong places. I think (s)he grew up as a homeless orphan who was deprived of parental affection and attention.
1543480922178384,34:19,Lihle Sokapase,"He needs professional help from a psychologist as a matter of urgency. Guys, feel free to make recommendations. Save the poor and forlorn."
1543480939080072,34:36,MAFU NDIKI,Investigation of state capture should start on the year of negotiations codesa 1&2 or earlier than that.
1543480996566290,35:34,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Thando Nkutha hey ANC was divided that more corrupt people were most vocal and powerful, whoever speaks the truth will be crushed to death until no ground to raise points"

1543481174409254,38:31,ST James Rama,Cyril won't do anything to japardise next years elections because he wants to be president 1st then we will see his real colours
1543481181052794,38:38,Frans Phala,@makhosi nobhatyi i remember when they would say they going to lead till jesus come or say to their members it is cold outside of ANC.... cocky ANC
1543481185071866,38:42,happy matshego,zuma is running away
1543481190970104,38:48,Solly 12,"Why are these advocates busy with other cases at the same time, instead of focusing on this commission until its work is done???"
