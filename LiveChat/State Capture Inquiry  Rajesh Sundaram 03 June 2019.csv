1559556101609404,1:41:49,Howard Hughes,Zuma is no 783 and counting...
1559556156305001,1:42:43,Wildthing,another way of saying it is Brown nosing .
1559556170800871,1:42:58,Tee Makara,@Big vinny thank you for the clarity was wondering what no 9 is
1559556179907947,1:43:07,Piet Madimetja,"Gangster,no9,snake more is still coming. Names are still coming. Watch space connects the dots."
1559556195847233,1:43:23,Magda Seguin,🤣Zumanomics
1559556197622178,1:43:24,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Zuma has got himself to blame... he's so or such a domkop @Simon Davies
1559556198268377,1:43:25,makhosi nobhatyi,I am waiting those guys who run away for 2 years to hide after they expose them
1559556216982016,1:43:44,Caron Hill,🤦Just popping in to say hello to my dear Brother @ KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU 👋
1559556221488277,1:43:48,Jabu Mkhwebane,@piet
1559556229857080,1:43:57,Howard Hughes,agreed Keith 100%
1559556294163655,1:45:01,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@makhosi nobhatyi Zuma economics were about involving business chaps to loot. Mbekis was to involve business leaders to employ citizens and help grow the economy.
1559556311275521,1:45:18,Mashudu Tshikororo,Brother Rajesh
1559556333621454,1:45:40,Magda Seguin,Mbeki is an economics graduate from Sussex University
1559556342981109,1:45:50,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Caron Hill Wow. Thought you've decided to be offline totally. Glad to chat with again... Are you goog?
1559556384709035,1:46:32,Howard Hughes,correct Keith. The country was moving forward under mbeki. Now its currently a basket case with hatred everywhere
1559556467074858,1:47:54,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Keith S. Dinabantu 😃😃😃 we must protect the sitting president, the old man started already to attack Ramaphosa not paying his legal fee where mbeki was doing that, say he doesn’t have money 😳😳😳"
1559556471955680,1:47:59,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Magda Seguin Yeah anyway, thats why he instead, captured the business leaders, and captured Zuma back, as some kind of revenge. Not a joke this anyway."
1559556485777946,1:48:13,Magda Seguin,All the politicians who pushed for Mbeki to be ousted and went to Polokwane to have Zuma instated as president are all complicit in his theft including supporting him for 9 years
1559556539388293,1:49:06,Nash Dube,@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU give us scoops bru
1559556543850961,1:49:11,Magda Seguin,And Malema was the most vocal in support of Zuma
1559556553946128,1:49:21,Zee Zondani,@makhosi nobhatyi 😂😂
1559556562983394,1:49:30,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,I always maintained @Magda Seguin .. Spot on!
1559556577467315,1:49:44,Wildthing,because he is the biggest puppet
1559556591820664,1:49:59,K,Julius “flip flop” Malema
1559556598820011,1:50:06,Howard Hughes,"Zuma taught Malema well, including how to steal"
1559556600521403,1:50:08,Zee Zondani,"Zuma last week said he is clean, he does not understand why people wana see him in jail and he does nt understand why Ramaphosa is not giving orders for the state to pick up that bill"
1559556642298898,1:50:49,makhosi nobhatyi,@Magda Seguin I think Zuma courts everyone in surprise coz they didn’t expect this to happen but were given him to much space to do whatever he wants so were too scared
1559556653131221,1:51:00,Magda Seguin,"EFF is in serious financial trouble,Manuel was vindicated,they owe him R500k with court cost"
1559556658067897,1:51:05,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@makhosi nobhatyi Hence he never pitched up on his inauguration right?
1559556666849946,1:51:14,Zee Zondani,Who trusts what Malema says? the man praised zuma for years and claimed his blood is blue and green and how he will never form a political party against the anc 😂😂 who can trust that?
1559556676146058,1:51:23,Magda Seguin,And another R109k for Afriforum
1559556699793607,1:51:46,K,@Magda the EFF took it on review. More costs
1559556703770969,1:51:51,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,lol. Malema is funding FF-PLUS and AfriForum
1559556733183976,1:52:20,Howard Hughes,Malema's mouth was always gonna get him into trouble...
1559556742404904,1:52:30,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,EFF assets were seized right?
1559556757205803,1:52:44,Sipho Swallow,Leave juju alone and talk about what we hearing here
1559556790499363,1:53:18,Lehlohonolo Dire,"Lol. It has never been possible that 1 manis more guilty than others. Im interested to see all names, and how they will be judged."
1559556802488991,1:53:29,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Simon Davies Big reckless mouth indeed! Was expecting more of trouble than the existing for Malema.
1559556810697536,1:53:38,Magda Seguin,News reports said over the weekend they have until Friday this week to pay Afriforum else they will seize assetts
1559556815478748,1:53:42,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Keith S.Dinabantu he read everything old man knows that going there is like supporting Ramaphosa, he wants the man to be out before he go to jail. They so glad when DD postpones his swearing in"
1559556830429584,1:53:57,Howard Hughes,"Sipho, I'll talk about who I want, when I want, and where I want..."
1559556843416507,1:54:10,Mzalwane Mzala,@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU The EFF has until Friday
1559556859319289,1:54:26,Magda Seguin,"Fact is,Zuma is the mastermind behind state capture.He sold the country to the Guptas"
1559556917328334,1:55:24,Howard Hughes,Myself too Keith. But there's much more coming for this clown
1559556946967083,1:55:54,Magda Seguin,And then the PP closes the Estina case and says she found nothing wrong
1559556952610153,1:56:00,makhosi nobhatyi,"They are attacking Gordhan because the man is a machinery to fight corruption and state corruption, I will rally behind Gordhan he is bold fighting corrupt elements"
1559556960438556,1:56:07,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Zikhona Zondani I think AfriForum is going to seize EFF assets this week. Watch the space.
1559556967486716,1:56:14,Zee Zondani,"how ironic that while zuma is on the hot seat, so is malema and his creche"
1559556983923771,1:56:31,Sipho Swallow,No.9 you in trouble
1559556991835665,1:56:39,Howard Hughes,I think you could be right Keith
1559557006272986,1:56:53,Magda Seguin,Manuel said he will donate the R500k to the VBS victims
1559557015726995,1:57:02,makhosi nobhatyi,Manyi buy new Age

1559557032525931,1:57:19,Andries Kgwax,makhosi nobhatyi : GORDON FIGHTING CORRUPTION THAT IS A LIE COLLECTIVE DOES
1559557047650425,1:57:35,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@makhosi nobhatyi They hate Pravin for exactly that. I can't understand why media can't show both sides of the story on this..... especially press.
1559557050736031,1:57:38,Magda Seguin,He said he wants no agents or middlemen involved in the distributing the money
1559557068373024,1:57:55,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Andries Kgwax Not Gordon maarn
1559557109640522,1:58:36,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,😂 I specifically waited for this day at the commission
1559557110084684,1:58:37,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Andries Kgwax Pravin was a hindrance to Zupta corruption...why he was removed and why van Rooyen was installed?
1559557122404974,1:58:49,Magda Seguin,"The EFF hate Gordhan,they want to hide the SARS problem"
1559557138298478,1:59:05,Andries Kgwax,I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE PRAISE ONE MAN FOR FIGHTING CORRUPTION
1559557155385989,1:59:22,Cassius Mngomezulu,Jimmy manyi's name will come sooon
1559557189409439,1:59:56,Magda Seguin,"There are many being praised,Manuel,Ramthlodi,the list is long...all decent honest men"
1559557212267669,2:00:19,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Andries Kgwax Its the reality. He was my boss for 7 years at SARS. Some people didn't like him cause he was strict on expenditure... He did the same with the corrupt Zuma crew and got fired overnite
1559557234048774,2:00:41,Cassius Mngomezulu,this chaula
1559557237799109,2:00:45,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Andries kgwax Gordhan he spoke out when there was allegations level by NPA, the man is a hard worker asked Zuma son too scared of him. Tried many times to block him not to talk about corruption"
1559557239631497,2:00:46,Zee Zondani,"I wonder what the party with social media votes is going to do this week, its going to be hectic. vbs is no longer available. their money pit closed down a while ago"
1559557256456981,2:01:03,Pheladi Lamola,Mara Zuma was and is an imbecile. The Guptas were actually laughing at the country (with Zuma) after the Waterkloof drama. Some unknown guy took the fall but Zuma knew!!!
1559557278842168,2:01:26,Zee Zondani,where is facebook and twitter inaugurating malema?
1559557311142391,2:01:58,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Andries Kgwax Don't be a denialist of the reality pls... Pravin hindered or prevented all the corrupt Zupta deals. He even gave Malema's funders a lot of problem on cigarette smuggling.
1559557325991044,2:02:13,ofhie Muofhe,malema's inauguration on youtube will be held on friday @ 12h00
1559557336407211,2:02:23,Ben Cole,There are politicians and officials who give credence to this saying/proverb: “Empty vessels make the most sound.” Will eventually catch up with them.
1559557346067372,2:02:33,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Zikhona Zondani 😂😂😂😂😂

1559557352171367,2:02:39,makhosi nobhatyi,This state capture mustn’t divide us instead unite us to fight any action of corruption and state capture no more that we allow to happen
1559557368667087,2:02:56,Andries Kgwax,that is lie
1559557377999403,2:03:05,Derek Main,Yep - only the ANC fools couldn't see that Zuma is a crook. Their votes caused all these problems for SA. And they are still being fooled by empty promises.
1559557389802441,2:03:17,Ditiro Mawai,what more evidence is required now??? to me this is enough evidence to jail the implicated ppl
1559557394658717,2:03:22,Andries Kgwax,I am ANC not Gordonist
1559557415466984,2:03:43,Magda Seguin,"Yes,people are suffering,28% unemployed,petrol increases,VAT at 15%...I can go on and on"
