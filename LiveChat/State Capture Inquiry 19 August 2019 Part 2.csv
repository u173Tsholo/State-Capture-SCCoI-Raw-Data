1566217317725960,23:11,Ibo Thabo,@Thando Nkutha most of the time most of the people here are not following the full time so it might be hard to update you
1566217382390248,24:16,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Nothing to do with Estina - it's about how Nxasana was axed by Zuma and how Jiba & Mwebi plotted to get him fired from NPA. They supported Zuma's enquiry on his fitness to hold office.

1566217844826262,31:58,Derek Main,@Ibo Thabo I don't think so - he wanted to reinstate charges against Zuma and hence he was pushed out of NPA
1566217913153378,33:06,Born free,Definitely Not one of Zumas Keepers.

1566218025966907,35:00,Lorraine Naidoo,Diss he was interviewed on tv nd told his story
1566218042427788,35:16,Anne M.,DCJ was able to study law with the help of an Indian shopkeeper who provided his family with food every month.
1566218054368047,35:27,Sindiswa Moolman,You are missing som zeros@Lorraine Naidoo. You must also note that that handshake was taxed. The taxes went to SARS. So he owes us the difference
1566218092774525,36:06,Pastor J.J,@Lorraine Naidoo U are absolutely right. It was a Muslim shopkeeper in Ixopo. They still run a scholarship programme together.

1566218371642757,40:45,Marc Tison,"My issue with this guy as a witness, regardless of how truthful he might be, is he ""lost"" the R17m he was paid. This will entirely make him a bad witness in a cross-examination."

1566218447423774,42:01,Pastor J.J,@Anne M. Definately so. Pain. Anguish. Anger and a very deep sense of loss. They were an amazing couple who I new closely and very personally. A deeply loved couple

1566218519190996,43:13,Magda Seguin,We Africans always fight against each other.Nothing changed in 25 years.This is a perfect example.

1566218920114601,49:54,Pastor J.J,@Diss & Dad They received bonuses for special tasks.
1566219031860312,51:45,Pastor J.J,@Diss & Dad They never did hence the lingering and continued anger by so many people

1566219355269312,57:08,Magda Seguin,The DCJ will never expose himself to be seen to be partial. whomever thinks he is biassed is not au fait with judicial ethics.
1566219485667841,59:19,Born free,Many people paid the ultimate price.
1566219531227637,1:00:04,Pastor J.J,@Diss & Dad Absolutely. The regime was ruthless and there was no hesitation to eliminate any level of threat. Even a non violent person like me suffered some very painful moments
1566219568186308,1:00:41,Born free,Yes and look at the country today.. is it any better off??
1566219663651656,1:02:17,PETER STAFFEN,my opinion the country is in a worse state than it was
1566219667928135,1:02:21,Pastor J.J,@Born free You are right my friend. A lot of sacrifices for the nonsense we have now makes it feel somewhat useless at times. No one knew better
1566219671228616,1:02:24,Magda Seguin,@Pastor J I often think what my life would have been if it was not for apartheid and how I had to flee the country as a very young woman
1566219724100840,1:03:17,Pastor J.J,@Magda Seguin At least we can tell the difference but painful
1566219754452092,1:03:48,Magda Seguin,I had so much hope in 1994 when I returned to SA but now find myself again in another continent.I am so homesick its not funny

1566220807840501,1:21:21,Magda Seguin,Joining the ANC after fleeing the country was a problem a lot of people were targeted and branded as spies hence a lot of us were rejected even with spotless credentials
1566220846711334,1:22:00,Born free,I think he was fit but he was pushed because Jiba wanted his position. Zuma and Jiba enabled each other.

1566221246611621,1:28:40,Born free,Nxasana was fit enough and not politisized. This man was and is a stand up man. We know Zumas faction had everything to do with his dismissal.
1566221286829640,1:29:20,jasper dougal,"No news about Zuma coming back again . I thought he was going to have a short time answering written questions and then would be back, lol"
1566221298621544,1:29:32,Magda Seguin,The ANC will implode eventually...the writing is on the wall
1566221311391933,1:29:44,Sofia Sofia,"I would really like to know when they sit down to talk ""business"" how do they speak .... do they sound DOM like this ?"
1566221327180501,1:30:00,Born free,It was Jiba and Mwyrebi
1566221336641979,1:30:10,Daud Musa,People should come to this commissions to tell the truth not to save their skins

1566221513117404,1:33:06,Magda Seguin,@Diss & Dad we also spent many feels in safe houses
1566221525983494,1:33:19,Sindiswa Moolman,Hope the commission will ask Zuma to pay back this R10m instead of this guy. This man went through a lot in few months he was there.
1566221544266200,1:33:37,Daud Musa,Yes Chair dig the truth because Pretorious has his own agenda
1566221549266402,1:33:43,Born free,"I believe that Nxasana could not go against the Zuma faction, he could not continue under that pressure to oust him."
1566221607761835,1:34:42,Nelson Musoliwa,Nxasana never asked the president(Zuma) to approve his vacating of his post at NPA;
1566221643249945,1:35:16,Daud Musa,Zuma baba phola this boys are playing.
1566221677195317,1:35:50,Born free,This was in 2014. State capture began in 1994 but escalated when Zuma became President in 2008/2009
1566221714124066,1:36:28,Magda Seguin,"In Botswana we used to pick-up ANC cadres who crossed the border, under hartowing conditions & some of them were badly tortured and a few committed suicide"
1566221737423583,1:36:50,Daud Musa,Malema already said we will die for Zuma
1566221739905206,1:36:53,Sofia Sofia,"It funny that Zuma had ""Death Threats "" while he was on here ... But he is still alive .... Assassins have let us down ...."
1566221755937980,1:37:09,Nelson Musoliwa,Zuma was clever to leave evidential trails in his dealings suspecting even that Xnasana will record him so his reluctance to meet him
1566221781803844,1:37:34,Magda Seguin,Even though the ANC didnt recognise many if us we still continued with the struggle ans helping our compatriotes
1566221791419284,1:37:44,Born free,"Yes Malema said "" We will kill for Zuma to be President ""."

1566221927011882,1:40:00,Magda Seguin,"I extricated myself from the ANC when Zuma came to power ,the destroyed the ANC.I never voted again."
1566221935898858,1:40:09,Ntembeko Mabuya,"makhosi nobhatyi Zuma's answer is one"" √è can't recall saying that'"""

1566222241419364,1:45:15,Ntembeko Mabuya,makhosi nobhatyi that's how stupid our former president is. When asked question they were connecting the dot's based on what was said by the people who were asked to come forward to testify
1566222247895038,1:45:21,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Magda Seguin it is long overdue saying CR must wake up and try to fight, he relaxed too much willing these people will be able to work together well but now he noticed that is not working last time"
1566222265604591,1:45:39,Magda Seguin,"Diss &Dad üôèMy late husband and I did it for the future of the children of the country,we didnt even consider our safety...we were a blip on the radar to be part of something that was bigger than us"
1566222307460307,1:46:21,Francois Cape Town,The Zuma years seem worse than Apartheid?!
1566222363146127,1:47:17,Mfana Dyasi,"Whatever happens, truth must just be revealed. We cannot afford to continue with corrupt activities in this country. There must be no holy cows!!!"
1566222369387587,1:47:23,makhosi nobhatyi,@ ntembeko mabuya he think he will dodge the lawsuit as he used before surely no forest to hide himself now
1566222465505994,1:48:58,Francois Cape Town,@Tholithemba Ntsele Zuma keeping previously disadvantaged people as currently disadvantaged?
1566222516493409,1:49:49,Magda Seguin,It pains me that so many honest people were hounded out during the Zuma years to make way for looters and Gupta acolytes..their lives and livelihoods was destroyed
1566222619399105,1:51:33,Magda Seguin,@Diss & Dad I completed the manuscript for my book but my first attempt to have it published was rejected but I may publish it myself
1566222622154794,1:51:35,Francois Cape Town,"@Tholithemba Ntsele That is not the point. Zuma created a new apartheid. The connected few, and then the rest"
1566222639004940,1:51:52,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Diss & Dad I fully agreed with you
