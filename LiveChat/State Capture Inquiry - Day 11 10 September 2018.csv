1536577094704451,2:47:24,Marvel Mushavhela,All DGs and CFOs of all departments must come and testify.
1536577096736717,2:47:26,Desmond Masilela,"@david jacobs, then he need to do something about Jacob Zuma's cabinet. because that cabinet is very corrupt."
1536577129287746,2:47:58,Tiny Nontulo,He should have done something already
1536577136878384,2:48:06,makhosi nobhatyi,Agree with Marvel
1536577142815779,2:48:12,david jacobs,@Desmond Masilela the problem is that CR doesnt do anything

1536577219770098,2:49:29,Robert Russell,All the CR comments are without foundation... you have to know it's the ANC before the Country.... that's why he has done nothing.
1536577223815589,2:49:33,Lucky123 Thwala,Lol
1536577235702898,2:49:45,Marvel Mushavhela,"They (DGs and CFOs) are the ones who need his to this point, without their approvals, we wouldn't be here."
1536577265678213,2:50:15,makhosi nobhatyi,Lol agreed with you Twala that one he must come really
1536577287817622,2:50:37,david jacobs,Tom Moyane is a bird from another stock yoh yoh yoh

1536577378049902,2:52:07,Desmond Masilela,@david jacobs. In my view David I think the man (CR) is waiting for next year to elect his new cabinet.
1536577385798418,2:52:15,Robert Russell,"Tom, Zwane, DD, ACE, Supra..... and more at every level in Govt...."
1536577387155065,2:52:16,T.S Mokoena,aaah mara Zondo n numbers
1536577437838853,2:53:07,Marvel Mushavhela,"Cyril must reshuffle now, we can't wait for next year. He can choose any midnight he wants to do it"
1536577440211801,2:53:10,david jacobs,@Desmond Masilela then he should listen to this commission to be taken seriously as this will hang on his doorpost come 2019
1536577504171860,2:54:14,Desmond Masilela,So the judge want to tell me that when his finish with this witness is over for today? he only started 10:00am and he wants to finish now at 13:30? it cant be.
1536577535715639,2:54:45,Marvel Mushavhela,"@Mokoena - Numbers will humble you, judges don't do stats in their training. Zuma knows that he won't mess with numbers😃😃"
1536577551671543,2:55:01,makhosi nobhatyi,Shame our best president CR has carryover all Zuma budon in his shoulder it is not on guys
1536577560340399,2:55:09,Desmond Masilela,😁😁😁 @david jacobs.
1536577617605778,2:56:07,T.S Mokoena,"lol but Maleka has already established the amount was 5.6 million, now the judge stops him and asks if it's close to 6 million... 😁"
1536577628021575,2:56:17,Tiny Nontulo,I don’t feel sorry for CR bcos when all of this happened he was there.
1536577636396560,2:56:26,Nokwazi Shongwe,"He was there as Deputy president, he shouldered this since he become a deputy president."
1536577661521129,2:56:51,Robert Russell,Zondo applied for a 24 month extension so he can work half days...... and charge the Tax payer 280 Million... for the pleasure of his company.
1536577671856058,2:57:00,T.S Mokoena,But I do agree with you @marvel
1536577703877688,2:57:33,Marvel Mushavhela,"I hope Manyi has bought new shoes this time. Cyril was there all the time, so does that intire top ANC top 6 and its structures. They can't fool us anymore, we aren't dumb."
1536577704880301,2:57:34,Desmond Masilela,You correct @Tiny Nontulo. He was there and he did nothing. even when Malema raised all these in Parliament they all kept quite.
1536577783255377,2:58:52,Tiny Nontulo,Yes hence I’m not surprised that he is still working with a corrupt cabinet. I don’t see him reshuffling them
1536577785688875,2:58:55,Desmond Masilela,It doesn't matter where CR is the president or not. I think he also need to come and testify.
1536577814784614,2:59:24,makhosi nobhatyi,Nontulo nothing you can do alone many people with majority surounded president and hawks and NPA was control by Zuma and all branches of the ANC in favor of Zuma what else you may do
1536577825308525,2:59:34,Wesley M,its true makhosi. Jocob Zuma was a disaster. he had now honest intensions with his presidency. now he wants to put together groups to overthrow Cyril. he will fail. he had the opportunity to serve SA.
1536577829335734,2:59:38,Serepa Le Mabona,Can you also say CR is responsible and complicit in the meeting that Ace held with Zuma because CR is in the same leadership with Ace?
1536577877887279,3:00:27,Siba Mfabe,"@Desmond Masilela , CR's deputy pre mandate is determined by the President, as he has done with DD, thus curtailing his influence on any kind of influence."
1536578000888875,3:02:30,Marvel Mushavhela,"if Cyril was serious about corruption during Zuma administration, he should have resigned the moment state capture was alarmed, instead he kept quiet like a sheep. He have all"
1536578006812067,3:02:36,david jacobs,@Nokwazi Shongwe the beauty of democracy must also put you in jail if you corrupt like these guys
1536578029267524,3:02:58,Desmond Masilela,Zondo wont have question I think his hungry now.
1536578047114899,3:03:16,david jacobs,Zondo is South AFrica's Barry White
1536578055517044,3:03:25,david jacobs,He should try singing
1536578056459186,3:03:26,Robert Russell,"@Nokwazi Shongwe sorry you wrong.... """"WE"""" don't a point a person to fill a roll in Government... we vote for a party and that is where the problem lies..."
1536578064978664,3:03:34,Nokwazi Shongwe,yes people are going to go to jail
1536578086160500,3:03:55,Siba Mfabe,"@Marvel Mushavhela , it may have been better for him to remain, can you imagine the upper hand team NDZ could have had."

1536578214743328,3:06:04,makhosi nobhatyi,Mushavhela you can’t do that just leave someone who run away is cowards if he did that Zuma was going to have more control and we can now have another Zuma such as Dlamini-zuma to defend him
1536578232025392,3:06:21,Marvel Mushavhela,But he could have at least make noise about it than to keep quiet
1536578256110646,3:06:45,Siba Mfabe,"@david jacobs , he is playing safe so far, Zuma's really rotten eggs, Dlamini; DD and Dlamini Zuma are quiet because they are kept in check with no budget control, they need presidential approval."
1536578256214955,3:06:45,Nokwazi Shongwe,"Robert Russell, it starts with the wrong leadership and filter down staff members, the power is with cabinet as you can see from this commission."
1536578279395495,3:07:09,Fils de l'homme,bantus are 3/5 human beings
