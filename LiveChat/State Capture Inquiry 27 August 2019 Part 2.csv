1566914103488984,1:53:53,Derek Main,@Manfred Nkonki But that is my whole point. Surely the constitution should make it impossible for the cadres to defend and protect a constitutional delinquent?

1566914493743977,2:00:24,Manfred Nkonki,@Derek Main That is on the shoulders of the NPA. The couts cannot force the NPA to institute chargers or not to drop chargers. Zuma is facing his charges as we speak.
1566914547085424,2:01:17,MIKE DURBAN,Poor soles.....the ANC has brainwashed da peoples.......true story..
1566914572937264,2:01:43,Derek Main,@Manfred Nkonki Then the constitution needs to be changed so that the NPA can be compelled to take up some cases and not fob them off like Abrahams did.

1566914633998794,2:02:44,Derek Main,"@Manfred Nkonki As for Zuma, my point is that he has worked the justice system so that he effectively escapes punishment. When he is eventually found guilty, he will argue old age as a defense."

1566914730942106,2:04:21,Manfred Nkonki,@Derek Main No doubt. I fully agree. Zuma appointed people in powerful positions. NPA. So maybe if the JSC appoints the NPA?
