1561365876797945,42:05,Felix Muyoba,this lady was involved in money laundering or her business was used as a money laundering entity..

1561365944545706,43:14,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane Everything the ANC touches turns to s**t.

1561366079236938,45:28,Born free,The previous witness has implicated her and the Investigator
1561366088771794,45:38,carnoth ngomane,@Derek just put up with that s****t for five year and come up with a strtegy to oust them

1561366232158665,48:01,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane My strategy would be that all the criminals be charged and sent to jail. That should get rid of most of the ANC officials. Corrupt to the core.
