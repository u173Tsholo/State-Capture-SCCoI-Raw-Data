1551352698442188,3:17:40,Kapn Krunch,the reason Kevin is because they keep lowering the amount of Mark's you need to pass to please the masses

1551353789117967,3:35:51,MANDLA DLUDLU,The only problem I am having with what Trevor is saying right now about skill set for government officials is that he was in government how come he did not push such ideas when he was there......
1551353823819655,3:36:26,Indoda Yamaqiniso,"Yes, and all our problems were created 300+ years ago by white settlers."
1551353834809259,3:36:37,Thami Mak'nyiwe Mhlanga,"With that been said, the ANC is doing the same thing by excluding majority of people and serving less that 200 000 people and enriching about 5 families over 50 million people,"

1551353884873782,3:37:27,Thami Mak'nyiwe Mhlanga,"is no accomplishment but rather unwise and short sighted. One beautiful point Manuel raised is that, there is no oversight within the ANC, no accountability and therefore, defaulted to anti-policing"
1551353886764176,3:37:28,Mzalwane Mzala,Local government is a local state and it cant be outside of the state capture
