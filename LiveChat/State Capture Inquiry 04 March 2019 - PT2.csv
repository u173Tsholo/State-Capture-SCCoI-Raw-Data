1551702041656333,20:53,Anne M.,Probably didn't sleep well last night knowing he would be appearing at this inquiry
1551702099348479,21:51,welton paulse,His game plan is to talk in this tone to put Zondo to sleep
1551702117638728,22:09,Willem van den Berg,lol Welton

1551702166183015,22:57,welton paulse,Or he wants the commission to have pity on him
1551702280100092,24:51,Anne M.,"@welton paulse His job might be on the line, if the new board possibly decides to suspend him pending the outcome of the inquiry."
1551702317217579,25:28,welton paulse,"NO NO NO, my dear sir, dont give us that I didnt know where to draw the line, Secret to doing something Excellent is to do it right from the beginning"

1551702405132700,26:56,welton paulse,@Anne M. i am wondering how many of these crooks at ESKOM got employed via the legitimate way of employment
1551702542264802,29:14,Anne M.,"@Thando Nkutha Yup, he might have under estimated both the advocate and the judge"
1551702587165874,29:57,Anne M.,@Thando Nkutha The correct thing would be for him to be suspended
1551702618307055,30:29,Chris Bard,Thisman is innocent
1551702727133024,32:18,Thamsanqa Zulu,"when the say external entities, they are normally lying."
