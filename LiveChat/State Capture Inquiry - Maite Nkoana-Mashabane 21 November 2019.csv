1574328974880550,1:31:44,Pastor J.J,"@Rob Withers ...Do you remember an episode called ""Infogate"" or a Dr Herschel Rhoodie?"
1574328991925181,1:32:01,Rob Nel,"@Pastor J Do so, the difference is, all SOE were productive and solvent"
1574329023037305,1:32:32,Kevin Simon,Witness leaves me with a sense of unease. Haven't quite put my finger on it yet.
1574329037232214,1:32:46,Pastor J.J,@MSG Rules It is relevant when we talk Corruption holistically and not selectively
1574329062920831,1:33:12,Pastor J.J,@Rob Nel I do agree with you

1574329109697250,1:33:59,Yolo More,"Immanuel, the chair is strategic. The Minister has a stuttering problem. If he does not act, this evidence will take forever."
1574329125298141,1:34:14,Kopela Mohohlo,"Maite Nkoana Mashabane is very useless imbecile and dont know what is she still doing in Parliament as she is only best at sleeping, she is a sleepist on note😀😀💤💤"
1574329154130293,1:34:43,Pastor J.J,@MSG Rules You are absolutely right. My question was explorative and from a simple point of interest. Nothing else.
1574329169110417,1:34:58,Rob Nel,How did this lady become a minister & MoP??
1574329174244098,1:35:03,Makwa Choma,She has low esteem very useless

1574329384275298,1:38:33,Yolo More,"Sboniso Sabelo, her constituency speaks louder than capacity in the ANC."
1574329385306504,1:38:34,Kevin Simon,DCJ has been through this evidence before and he knows there are gaps that must be exposed. I think there was interference in Koloane's redeployment.
1574329387850510,1:38:37,Makwa Choma,I honestly cant gather why people vote for such
1574329388505319,1:38:37,MSG Rules,Zukile - don't think she is cautious. she has no clue what she is beign asked

1574329767626291,1:44:56,Francoise Phillips,She thinks she can 'smile' her way out of this.
1574329771852426,1:45:01,Elvis Malakoane,when she talks generally her voice is loud when specific answer is needed her voice go slower
1574329772801927,1:45:02,Thulani Bukani,What is a fine diplomat? And what value do they bring to regular citizens?
