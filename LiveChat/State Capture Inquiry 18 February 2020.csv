1582013867977027,35:09,Pheladi Lamola,You're absolutely right @mxolisi buthelezi. I've been asking myself why they didn't notice the movement of monies that big.
1582013889715622,35:30,anya van loggerenberg,he has a right to an interpreter regardless if he needs on or not
1582013900486208,35:42,Maryann Diamond,cuz they got a cut

1582014477054356,45:17,FieliesSA,She still sounds tons better(flcomfortable) than the Afrikaans interpreter for Basson(state capture inquiry) and even the other guy at Neil Agetts inquiry
1582014482146404,45:23,Mabutho Mabaso,"@Tholithemba, the interpreter is far out of her linguistic depth. Since yesterday she has been doing a less than desirable job at interpreting with her ‚Äújoburg Zulu‚Äù"
1582014534943632,46:15,Jabu Malinga,"The water truck companies and guys selling water tanks are minting it, while it is simple to put in pipes and pumps and taps.its not rocket science"
1582014625714818,47:46,mxolisi buthelezi,So even amaZulu are 'discriminating' against their own. Uyabona nje i-tribalism is dangerous...
1582014632497716,47:54,Jabu Malinga,"water is flowing into the sea while daily, all over SA, yet we hear that SA is water scares. Go to Dubai in that desert, they hav no water problems. that is water scares, not SA"

1582014645241999,48:06,FieliesSA,@Tholithemba Ntsele You mean morphed Zulu. A Zulu prevalent amongst urban/ younger blacks. The same has happened to afrikaans. Even English...

1582014691624608,48:53,mxolisi buthelezi,@Sthakathi Khumalo hahahahaha you're funny. I agree
1582014739675970,49:41,Mabutho Mabaso,@Mxolisi Buthelezi you have completely missed the point. It‚Äôs been explained very clearly.
1582014778546315,50:20,Musa Mabunda,"@Eliot Chauke yes he does, he confirmed at the start of his evidence yesterday, he just prefered to testify in Zulu"

1582014875914146,51:56,mxolisi buthelezi,"@Mabutho Mabaso trust me I get it. What you don't get is that languge/culture is not static. With urbanization, languages/culture are bound to mix hence her speech flow...what you call Joburg Zulu"

1582014926655225,52:48,Anne M.,@Gee Peex1 Mr X stated he can read and write English. He prefers to speak in his mother tongue while giving evidence.
1582014929462274,52:51,Musa Mabunda,@Mtokozisi Baleni then he chairperson of the commission and courts will decide
1582014939045477,53:00,Musa Mabunda,@Mbuso Ndlovu he's the next witness
1582014939640157,53:00,Sibusiso Mthokozisi Dubazana,Isnt he supposed to testify next?

1582014984825647,53:46,mxolisi buthelezi,@Tholithemba Ntsele fair enough...
1582014992447632,53:54,Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 ...It is perfectly legal. But in a Court of Law it needs to be Qualified to ensure that the Interpretation was done correctly.
1582014999739146,54:00,Zibuyile Luthuli,Mr Majola will testify today
1582015007866182,54:09,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Apparently chair slipped and called Mr X - Majola, now who is majola really??"

1582015031076892,54:31,Mtokozisi Baleni,@Musa the chair understand and speaks original zulu not this Jo'burg mixture
1582015066820166,55:08,Nkateko Vukeya,these numbers are killing our interpreterüòÅ
1582015097634924,55:38,Jabu Malinga,"Dudu is the crime boss, these guys were just d runners."
1582015101273747,55:42,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Zibuyile Luthuli Majola will probably not remember much like Mr MyeniüòÄüòÅüòÇ
1582015118611468,55:59,Jabu Malinga,"Zuma was Dudus boss, in crime n bed"
1582015128701146,56:09,Mtokozisi Baleni,@Sthakathi Majola is the key/star witness
1582015139503844,56:20,Jabu Malinga,"Gupta was Zuma boss, in crime n curry"
1582015150480084,56:30,Anne M.,@Gee Peex1 I have no idea
1582015176345659,56:57,Pheladi Lamola,Why don't they show us Ms interpreter today instead of that empty chair?
1582015191649901,57:12,Jabu Malinga,"Gee Peex1, Inkatha or Buthelezi party ?"

1582015236008851,57:57,Anne M.,@Pheladi Lamola Maybe the interpreter saw the nasty comments about her hair yesterday and asked not to be filed.
1582015241597674,58:02,Anne M.,*filmed
1582015243364842,58:05,Jabu Malinga,"I don't think many of u are really following the evidence, just commenting for free. hehehehe..zuma laugh"
1582015244073933,58:06,Mtokozisi Baleni,@Pheladi am sure the hairstyle sold her out or camera pressure
1582015251561537,58:12,Siya Manukula,mamela isivuno trading tjoooooooooo
1582015325398214,59:26,Pheladi Lamola,Yeah people can be nasty to others sometimes.
1582015355175201,59:56,Mtokozisi Baleni,@ Jabu easy to follow its money laundering and corruption
1582015358340758,59:59,Jabu Malinga,"it is clear that this witness, unlik son of dudu, is incapable of lying, so I, as the judge and jury, accept his evidence.. hehehehe"

1582015501567871,1:02:21,Pheladi Lamola,"If Mr Majola is listening to this he'll just say I never gave such instructions, especially if there are no records of any such instructions"

1582015531503789,1:02:52,Mabutho Mabaso,"@Mxolisi Buthelezi reads like you agree, we can‚Äôt have a diluted Zulu for such a serious matter. Furthermore, the Judge on numerous occasions has corrected the interpreter, that‚Äôs concerning"
1582015536817012,1:02:58,Musa Mabunda,@Pheladi Lamola then the chair will make his findings
1582015541773164,1:03:02,Jabu Malinga,"Pheladi, that is why ter is a judge, to decide who is telling the truth"

1582015772517242,1:06:53,Isaac Mutasa,Africans will be concerned about an interpreter speaking diluted Zulu and not millions of Rands looted by the ANC kleptocrats who you keep returning to power.
1582015789966606,1:07:11,Anne M.,"@Mtokozisi Baleni Yes, similar to Gavin Watson"
