1580991672275796,3:42,Sibusiso Hadebe,I just wonder what will happen at end of this commission
1580991695861021,4:05,clive oconnell,SAA money already gone on Gupta magic carpet to Dubai
1580991709853156,4:20,Person of interest,@clive is medical treatment better in Cuba than here?

1580991763967417,5:13,Walter Christon Kawara,The chi√ßkens have come home to roost
1580991801282702,5:50,Sibusiso Hadebe,"Yooo ESKOM, SAA, PRASA, all gave the Guptas free money, Ohh Jehova"
1580991872904075,7:02,clive oconnell,@Person No! 20yrs+ behind. Press don‚Äôt bother you comrade
1580992128092974,11:17,clive oconnell,India cheaper on Teeth and many other üí∞üí∞operations
1580992189301830,12:19,Abdul Kader S,Zuma and Cuban cigars any connection?
1580992207823283,12:37,Person of interest,"I am trying to understand why ministers seek medical treatment outside SA. or do they? is it press Mischief, or was there a report that JZ is sick outside SA?"
1580992227668451,12:57,Dominic Przybylski,Though I'm not so sure now. I was last in Thailand 5 years ago when 1Rand = 3 Thai Bhat. Now can only get 2 Bhat for a Rand.
1580992245405854,13:15,Person of interest,oh OK thanks!
1580992321818857,14:30,clive oconnell,@Dominic Your correct Baht very strong
1580992326835933,14:35,Person of interest,This is an interesting witness. gives us a peep into how things work in the industry.
1580992374557353,15:24,Dominic Przybylski,@Person of interest Yup the difference in exchange rate is proportional to the amount of Rands which have disappeared into Dubai.
1580992382007881,15:31,George ashwood yaw owusu,Yes Africans are up and coming we need to come to together as one people
1580992502951452,17:31,Kevin,"Is BB-BEE not meant to be ""broad based"" ? So its quite cool for 1 person to be the BB-BEE component in a multi million dollar deal and that 1 person gets all the benefits ?"
1580992521158624,17:50,Dominic Przybylski,"Some Africans are up and coming eg. Rwanda, Etheopia but I don't think they want to come together with a failing state like South Africa. They don't want to be dragged down by us."
1580992809014091,22:38,Person of interest,did we learn anything from Rwanda?
1580992844840118,23:14,Person of interest,lol
1580992873192757,23:42,Dominic Przybylski,We too busy trying to learn enough to get 30%. Don't have enough time or energy to learn anything else.
1580992943775591,24:53,Manfred Kaanjosa,any info from sadec on the Namibian fishrot case
1580993000123113,25:49,Person of interest,we don't have the patience of the Zimbabwean people. but we learned to not trust our mainstream media
1580993070765024,27:00,Dominic Przybylski,We have a government who believe communism is the answer to all our problems. They haven't yet heard about the collapse of the Soviet Union.
1580993213674099,29:23,Dominic Przybylski,Zondo so far has spent R350 million. NPA got R1.5 billion. Still not one conviction for corruption.
1580993364390597,31:54,Person of interest,wuttt????
1580993461253925,33:30,Angel55,I'm in.

1580993537803337,34:47,Person of interest,"me too, but I'm a short person..."
1580993670024059,36:59,Wildthing,Stay on the subject of the day. what they talking about. it's not a general chat room. its about today's topic.
1580993725246471,37:55,Person of interest,"yes boys, interesting witness here"
1580993752105472,38:22,Pastor J.J,"A blessed afternoon to all of you, my Precious Friends."
1580993971795730,42:01,Anne M.,Hello @Pastor J
1580994013792832,42:43,Immanuel,"@Pastor J blessed afternoon to you too, üôèüôè"
1580994054413318,43:24,Pastor J.J,Hello my Dear Friend@Anne M. ...@redriger ...@Michael Wild .....@Immanuel and anyone else I may have missed.
1580994066234471,43:35,Dominic Przybylski,Who/What is AAR?
1580994089530681,43:59,Pastor J.J,Greetings @Dominic Przybylski
1580994110708397,44:20,Dominic Przybylski,Hi
1580994183832487,45:33,Anne M.,AAR was the company that yesterday's witness was involved with
1580994210445870,45:59,Dominic Przybylski,Thanks @Anne M. I missed yesterday.
1580994224367783,46:14,Anne M.,AAR wanted the supply contract with SAA Technical
1580994232748240,46:22,Pastor J.J,They are an American based Aircraft and Aviation Related Repair Company @Dominic Przybylski
1580994282244867,47:11,Wildthing,Hello Pastor
1580994294419892,47:23,Dominic Przybylski,So AAR has no BEE connection?
1580994320414837,47:49,Kevin,I think JM (local BB component) for AAR who won the tender under dubious circumstances. AAR is an American company I think
1580994347838446,48:17,Pastor J.J,"Yes. They were tightly attached to a local company. Therein lies a lot of ""fun"" to come. JM Aviation"
1580994390850580,49:00,Pastor J.J,Correct Kevin
1580994509332281,50:58,Kevin,1.8 billion contract that does not function....incredible
1580994566362659,51:55,Dominic Przybylski,@Kevin seems to be standard procedure in public sector.
1580994603592272,52:33,Truth Is,government is mind control
1580994627025232,52:56,Dominic Przybylski,@Stronger together It seems you underestimate just how big a billion is.
1580994648420926,53:17,Anne M.,@Stronger together This is not the only fishy contract at SAA.
1580994873622778,57:03,Kevin,so in short...the local BB component gets 53 million for doing fakkal....just to aid in a corrupt deal and spend the money
1580994929846338,57:59,Dominic Przybylski,"17 million social grants is peanuts compared to what we are giving to pay for ex-presidents' and retired MPs benefits and pension payouts to Molefe types, apart from the Guptas and their ilk."
1580994973515283,58:43,Anne M.,Which makes all this graft and corruption all the more atrocious
1580995047279258,59:56,Kevin,Imagine if we could recoup just 50 % of all stolen money....We could settle ESCOM and SAA problems and have change left over
1580995117010765,1:01:05,Kevin,I spoke to a guy the other day...a very very clever dude.....he says the following
1580995142644317,1:01:32,Dominic Przybylski,"We will recoup nothing of the stolen money. It is long gone, converted into $ and squirreled away in Caymen Islands and Dubai."
1580995195880426,1:02:25,Kevin,Assume SA receives R 10 inntax revenue using the current tax legislation....if we scrap the current tax system and replace it with the following
1580995264450658,1:03:33,Kevin,Every bank transaction is taxed 2 % and payed into one government tax account we would generate R25....
1580995338021222,1:04:47,Kevin,no SARS offices required. No paperwork...Everyone pays 2 % irrespective of earnings and spending
1580995359429259,1:05:08,Dominic Przybylski,@Sipho The Xing Agreed. Government already owns more than the rest of us combined yet still want more. Cape Town sitting on R18 billion while introducing extra taxes and levies.
1580995428550374,1:06:17,Dominic Przybylski,They have more than they can spend (underspent by R4 billion) last year but they still try to take even more from the citizens. DA are even worse than ANC.
1580995563362736,1:08:32,Kevin,Redriger it's simple....may paycheck is taxed 2%...I spend my paycheck and taxed 2 %....all controlled by the banks....
1580995606432486,1:09:15,Dominic Przybylski,@Sipho The Xing What planet are you on? Our government is a communist government.
1580995633807292,1:09:43,Dominic Przybylski,@redriger Join Capitec.
1580995699370560,1:10:49,Kevin,Everyone just pays 2 % tax on each bank transaction....no VAT....no paye...
1580995782212159,1:12:11,Dominic Przybylski,@Stronger together I get 9.5% interest on 5 year fixed deposit. British banks give from 0% to .02% interest on balance.
1580995833658172,1:13:03,DJ DJ,but if rand keeps getting worse your interest in ponds if more
1580995845919065,1:13:15,DJ DJ,is more
1580995943202613,1:14:52,Dominic Przybylski,@redriger Always had fantastic service from Capitec. Only bank which opened an account faster was one in Thailand. 15 minutes from entering a branch to having a card and drawing from ATM.
1580996160024888,1:18:29,Kevin,I came into some significant capital back in 1990 and bought us dollars and invested overseas. Usd to ZAR was then 2.50.....now its R 14.82
1580996262478728,1:20:12,Kevin,Now Donald Trump is the boss....I will never win
1580996286897410,1:20:36,Dominic Przybylski,My first car cost me R450.
1580996303865111,1:20:53,Kevin,I got married in 1990üòÇ
1580996434176653,1:23:03,Anne M.,@Stronger together Geography?
1580996518380023,1:24:27,Person of interest,Franceland?
1580996618484402,1:26:07,Wildthing,Sipho I only got my business degree at 31 so never give up.
1580996631899541,1:26:21,Person of interest,Run if you can. I am from Botswanaland
1580996712882591,1:27:41,Dominic Przybylski,Bill Gates dropped out of university in 2nd year. Richest man in the world. Degree means nothing if you don't have self-discipline.
1580996762162048,1:28:31,Person of interest,Try Namibia
1580996762686710,1:28:32,Dominic Przybylski,Don't look for a job. Look for an opportunity.
1580996784285366,1:28:54,Kevin,well said Dom....no true word spoken
1580996845834366,1:29:55,Phillip Cwazibe,"@Dominic Przybylsk Indeed and goes together with ""Self-motivation"""
1580996863287159,1:30:13,Wildthing,like the guy that started a sandwich business on a st corner and now has a a big business and turns over a good living and employs others.
1580996897078318,1:30:46,Kevin,Discipline...respect and willingness to work
1580997021334195,1:32:50,Dominic Przybylski,When I started working I told employers I just wanted to work on things that interested me and what they paid me was not important. I almost always got the job.
1580997099973436,1:34:08,Victor,This transaction puzzles me
1580997124207952,1:34:34,Dominic Przybylski,@redriger exactly.
1580997202711121,1:35:52,Pastor J.J,A blessed and safe evening to all of you.
