1536222882863156,38:28,Desmond Masilela,Can someone help me please. The submission that they presenting here. is that a closing argument? are they still going to call more witness or what?
1536222955729989,39:40,hub.grasstruths,@Desmond Masilela the establishment doesn't want to allow cross examinations because it will kick up too many names they want to hide

1536223082420520,41:47,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,lifestyle audit????? does he owe taxes? been bribed? stolen??? shedding tears cannot be equated to being emotional on a commissioners stand
1536223105075609,42:10,Marvel Mushavhela,I hope Zuma doesn't expect us to pay his legal fees for proceedings during this commission.
1536223132392557,42:37,Joseph Thobejane,we waste our data to listen the letter from the criminal

1536223178671779,43:24,hub.grasstruths,@Desmond Masilela I think the publisc will support the commissioner denying cross examination - this wouid be unfortunate. The establishment wants us to buy the narrative of blaming foreigners..

1536223404434469,47:09,hub.grasstruths,@Desmond Masilela I believe he is a lawyer and his submission is calling for the opportunuty tyo cross examine a witness
1536223426091747,47:31,hub.grasstruths,It seems ridiculous that anyone should have to submit an argument for something so obvious
1536223469405073,48:12,hub.grasstruths,This submission will be denied. Itis a means to swep the real story under a rug
1536223483131403,48:27,Louis Germishuizen,Nomthetho it's like that...all experiences proof it. Very sad in these times.
1536223503616471,48:48,Desmond Masilela,I think that will be fare too @Steemit OneAzania . but also they need to call Ajay Gupta and hi brother to come testify and call Jacob Zuma too. dont you think so Steemit?

1536223697993732,52:03,Norman Zwane,may draw a blank here. The accuser's version must be tested. But the implicated must also their version across as well.

1536223780304017,53:24,Norman Zwane,@Bronx Wavy I doubt if Faith has a version since Pottenger is no more.

1536224087803631,58:32,hub.grasstruths,this is a whitewash just like the esidimeni inquiry
1536224090103660,58:35,Santjie Ntuli,this is just time waisting
1536224143177624,59:28,Joseph Thobejane,There is no justice in South Africa
1536224144634263,59:29,Paul de Bruyn,"he is requesting ""The milk of human kindness"" for the guptas! Bwahahaahahahahahahaah"
1536224154413534,59:39,Norman Zwane,@Steemit OneAzania So you following this whitewash by choice. Why?
1536224158402815,59:43,hub.grasstruths,No one can be captured unless their minds are weak. These guys sold the people out. Simple. Capture is an excuse
1536224185733797,1:00:10,Mpumelelo Hlatshwayo,This Guy is Wasting time
1536224187508523,1:00:12,kenneth mampa,Actually this guy should start by telling us when is he returning our land
1536224194222138,1:00:18,peter pott,"Hellens sc, is quite correct. this matter should be tested in court of law. not this story of applying for cross examination"
1536224199700294,1:00:24,hub.grasstruths,@Norman Zwane just like you I follow it. Would you like me to stop following it?
1536224212685557,1:00:37,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Paul de Bruyn Hahaha. Though, he's our own, and knows what Guptas did was not right. But he's a lawyer, thats his job."

1536224246638611,1:01:11,Desmond Masilela,I think the only way to get people arrested its only when people can appear in court of Law. That we can say yes people will be arrrested. @Steemit OneAzania
1536224254381822,1:01:19,hub.grasstruths,"If his submission wins the day, iut will work in the interest of truth not only for one accused."
1536224255655795,1:01:20,Nomthetho Nokwakha,yes sellout is the right word not state capture
1536224287369622,1:01:51,hub.grasstruths,@Desmond Masilela that's correct. The prosecuting authority doesnt want to build a case against their own people

1536225281962818,1:18:26,Enoch Dipela,Maybe we need to give them the benefit of doubt this time around because they are aware of the impact of state capture and looting that has and continuing to take place in our country.
