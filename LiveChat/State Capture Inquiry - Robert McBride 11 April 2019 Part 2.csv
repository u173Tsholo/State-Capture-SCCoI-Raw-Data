1554986367773658,35:58,Kapn Krunch,they believe order trumps justice
1554986382984568,36:14,Danie Nilsen,see again a block
1554986388588591,36:19,peter sikoshule,is there any explosive evidence mcbride said since he took the stand?
1554986428650705,36:59,Danie Nilsen,no nada zilch kuafela
1554986437969170,37:08,Dumile Mateza,@Bongumenzi Nxumalo This evidence is led to demonstrate how state security agencies were weakened and repurposed to serve a particular purpose. Therefore it does not belong to the Mokgoro commission
1554986462524715,37:33,Mhlekase Leepile,Who send white jail when they were eating RSA money?
1554986473382646,37:43,Mzalwane Mzala,He confirms how crime intelligence fabricated a case against the national and Gauteng heads of Hawks.
1554986523338199,38:32,Bongumenzi Nxumalo,Pheladi Lamola It was to probe the fitness to hold office of suspended NPA Advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi
1554986532977087,38:42,Philani Madlala,That idiot parody bary roux spoke about this
1554986540665797,38:49,Kapn Krunch,not prosecuting government officials isn't just a south African thing it's a world wide thing here in africa we are more blessed because over here they are too stupid to go about their business with
1554986543265785,38:52,Kapn Krunch,tact
1554986578810926,39:28,peter sikoshule,but now fabrication of 1 case does it forms part of state capture?
1554986617361653,40:05,Bongumenzi Nxumalo,"Dumile Mateza True, but why I say so.. it lays a background that would have settled the tone to probe the so called bots. But I agree with you."
1554986634328524,40:22,Magda Seguin,@peter read the Amabhungane article...it is very long buy explains everything
1554986637365460,40:25,peter sikoshule,we no longer on state capture. we on rendition case about mcbride friend sibiya

1554986698082332,41:26,Johann Botha,same
1554986706809661,41:35,Mzalwane Mzala,The head of Hawks was targeted because they had started to investigate certain connected people so they had to be booted out of the service
1554986759487359,42:45,Magda Seguin,It shows how McBride and Dramat was being falsely implcated as they were deemed hindrances
1554986822540592,43:47,palamang ntai,No Mhle corrupt people must be tried and be jailed if fund to have performed any wrong doing by the african courts not by the ICC
1554986856753876,44:20,Danie Nilsen,is this ipid same as old russians KGB ?
1554986858293899,44:22,Magda Seguin,"Those against state capture was flushed out...just like at the SOE's...they were either suspended,sacked,asked to resign"
1554986877961967,44:42,Born free,Is this the Terrorist McBride who murdered all those innocent people at Magoo's. Yes of course it is
1554986901553288,45:05,Mhlekase Leepile,I was in school 80s I know what I'm talking about.

1554986955370572,45:59,Kapn Krunch,the first time I ever went to a court to bail a friend the schedule wasnt up so I asked a judge walking by the first thing he said was ask for a bribe corruption even in courts is that common place
1554986957639012,46:02,Anne M.,@Danie Nilsen IPID is not the same as the old KGB. I think it's State Security (could be wrong)
1554986958752319,46:03,Cyril Nyiko,val speirs it is him the freedom fighter himself.
1554986968852919,46:13,Magda Seguin,@mvubu 1234 my sentiments exact
1554986997942355,46:42,peter sikoshule,mc bride is so bitter and desperate
1554987030696642,47:16,barbara broadbent,IPIID is the department that looks into Police corruption
1554987030747309,47:16,Magda Seguin,You are right Anne M...IPID oversees SAPS
1554987031896912,47:17,Danie Nilsen,i know it is him he was braging about in durban head office amonst his comarads of the scteaming like pigs and chaos
1554987047877560,47:32,carnoth ngomane,@peter sikoshule why are you saying that
1554987049650280,47:34,Derek Main,@peter sikoshule Seems like he is more honest that the entire ANC combined.
1554987059838540,47:44,Cerebis,"@Danie Nilsen No, IPID is the authority that focuses on SA Police crimes and corruption. Not a secret service type. Probably more like the USA internal affairs Cops."
1554987066984016,47:51,Magda Seguin,@Peter why do you say so?What do you know?
1554987079815624,48:05,Mzalwane Mzala,@peter sikoshule He was proven right on the case that he is testifying about now
1554987105146792,48:30,Kapn Krunch,I'd bet my last dollar everyone watching this has paid a bribe before
1554987124853141,48:49,Thapelo Motabogi,"so i just want to know,all these things of state capture including the year 1994 on wards,it is Jacob Zuma's mess,how did zuma capture everyone,whites and blacks"

1554987169834263,49:34,Anne M.,@Kapn Krunch Then you will lose your bet
1554987178626690,49:43,Magda Seguin,@Thapelo it's all in the public domain for 10 years
1554987183411339,49:49,Danie Nilsen,"@Anne M. i do not see the function they had or that they knew what they were suppose to do, was it spying on gov officials if so then it is likeKGB"
1554987191938039,49:56,Frik Brits,"@Kapn Krunch , I've never paid bribes before and never will"
1554987212735747,50:17,Norman Zwane,@Mzalwane Mzala McBride has his own agenda. I wish I understood him. I reather like how he is blowing lid off some holy cows - wonder he might want to hold back however?
1554987215462945,50:20,Kapn Krunch,not even for drunk driving ? dont lie
1554987241102980,50:45,Anne M.,"@Danie Nilsen IPID investigates complaints against the police, not the same as spying"

1554987287667496,51:32,Kapn Krunch,I've bribed a cop with a coffee because it was all I had back when I used to drive without a license
1554987288463782,51:33,Briony French,"Then you are apart of the problem, accepting a bribe and giving a bribe is the same thing.... Dont let Policticians aka Criminals bribe you."

1554987294852932,51:39,Bongumenzi Nxumalo,But McBride as much as he is spilling beans.. He must mention names that were behind this attempt to capture everything by any means!! Agrizzi set a tone that all should follow
1554987297351492,51:42,peter sikoshule,I know he will be cross examined so u guys will understand why I say he is bitter and desperate. Let me not talk too much
1554987308822643,51:53,welton paulse,Is he saying Mrs Mbeki?
1554987320199745,52:05,Mzalwane Mzala,"@Norman Zwane This is case number 1 that he is testifying on. I do not want to speculate on what is still to come. On this one, we need to know how did it happen that the head of hawks was implicated"
1554987332595754,52:17,Magda Seguin,That is why it is called Independent Police Investigation Directorate...Nd Bride was the Director until his contract was not renewed recently by Cele
1554987378062859,53:03,Magda Seguin,He is mentioning names!!
1554987438584011,54:03,Norman Zwane,"@Mzalwane Mzala yeah I agree one needs to not speculate but let this play itself out, we may yet be suprised."

1554987482137723,54:47,Mzalwane Mzala,It is a fact that Mcbride did for IPID what Thuli Madonsela did for Public Protector ofice.
1554987491187318,54:55,M T,"#Briony French ... Yip, the problem is real 🤦🏼‍♀️"

1554987522314779,55:28,Mzalwane Mzala,He fought for the independence of IPD and took Ministers to court for meddling in IPID's work
1554987522371012,55:28,Briony French,@Moira T I have already reported his comments and his channel with nothing on it.

1554989613527162,1:30:18,carnoth ngomane,@Fils de l'homme but you never explained to me what is the freedom of transvaal

1554990186008763,1:39:51,Magda Seguin,I really honour the people of Sudan in the way they took so Bashir down...they came out in their hundreds of thousands since December 2018 until he resigned today

1554990403201756,1:43:27,Fils de l'homme,@Val Speirs what d u mean?
1554990403665919,1:43:28,Mzalwane Mzala,"The demise of the ANC was proclaimed since its formation in 1912 and the ANC still here, winning elections."
1554990405469825,1:43:30,carnoth ngomane,@Bongumenzi Nxumalo not the demise rather a wake up call
1554990414705409,1:43:39,Derek Main,@Val Speirs I guess it's a matter of opinion.
1554990446930769,1:44:11,Danie Nilsen,is it possable for them ever wake up and to what
1554990456812915,1:44:21,Magda Seguin,@Cerebis follow AOC and the Young Turks on Twitter and you will get a picture of Trumps madness
1554990495168888,1:44:59,Born free,Freedom of Transvaal sounds like colonies for different races or what?
1554990523379016,1:45:28,Cerebis,@Anne M. No Watson has be charged or prosecuted in SA yet in regards to this commision. Most of us however hope that they will!!??
1554990528965561,1:45:33,Bongumenzi Nxumalo,"Mzalwane Mzala Its not the total loss or collapse, hence, weakening... The truth is, slowly ANC is loosing its touch/detaching away from what it was founded on!!"
1554990529826904,1:45:34,carnoth ngomane,"@Mzalwane Mzala its only a wish for may people but it will never happen, in fact this commission will only strengthen ANC"
1554990539424186,1:45:43,Born free,I think this testimony is boring.......
1554990558261856,1:46:02,Dumile Mateza,I am actually surprised that there are two or thre discussions taking place on this platform. The whites are talking to each other and blacks talking to each other.
1554990561091926,1:46:05,Bongumusa Mabika,"These subtitles though 😂😂😂 what language are some of the words they are writing here. Appreciating that they are doing it for the deaf, but meaning is lost in many of these words"
1554990573626388,1:46:18,Derek Main,@Bongumenzi Nxumalo Correct - the ANC is a shadow of what it was before.
1554990607947808,1:46:52,Danie Nilsen,i think we the people of south africa should think of a federal state wher each one can decide in what state he or she will be comfortable
1554990622240176,1:47:07,Cerebis,@Magda Seguin I stay away from Twitter....it is mostly for Twits. I however believe that Trump is an unstable liar that proves that anybody can become POTUS.
1554990669071691,1:47:53,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main and thanks to this commission ANC will go back to basics and redress
1554990674603505,1:47:58,Robert Russell,@Magda Seguin ... I don't want to be personal.... but if i may ask where do you live and what do you do for a living... or your background... your knowledge is indeed impressive
1554990702315987,1:48:27,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane Don't hold your breath. The ANC is too corrupt to self-correct.
1554990711442224,1:48:37,Magda Seguin,I am only on Twitter for the credible academic work I am involved in but I also take note of world affairs as I need to know the political dynamic to do my work including the financial markets.
1554990720386262,1:48:45,Danie Nilsen,"trump is the best president the WORKD have ever experiance, maybe a bit of script but efective send him to us plz"
1554990723984465,1:48:48,Born free,Trump is the greatest President the US will ever have. There economy is booming and Trump is not bought by the beurocr
1554990748775662,1:49:13,Magda Seguin,@Robert I can't sorry
1554990752953310,1:49:17,Eslon Eslon,"@Derek Main, ANC wouldn't be what it is today had it not made JZ its president"
1554990759601713,1:49:23,Sindiswa Moolman,Some people’s names here give an impression that they are intelligent until they say something. It’s really disappointing.
1554990777789143,1:49:42,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main it will eventually the passed 10 years must be a warning to many of us
1554990781966668,1:49:46,Magda Seguin,@Robert thanks for the compliment.
1554990810658263,1:50:15,Derek Main,@Eslon Eslon That is true but I think the rot started before him. He just took it to it's logical conclusion.
1554990829214193,1:50:34,peter pott,political prisoners must go for trauma counseling. they still carry lot of scars.
1554990830557345,1:50:35,Mzalwane Mzala,@Bongumenzi Nxumalo I responded to the word 'demise' and I believe I was correct.
1554990839807984,1:50:44,Lew464,"Sindiswa Moolman , well said!!!"

1554994178494250,2:46:23,peter pott,"my disappointment with president CR is that he never brought us a new face. only recycling.batohi was a prosecutor, kieswetter worked at sars, mboweni too is back . bring someone black or white new"
1554994183112841,2:46:27,Pheladi Lamola,I agree @Mzalwane Mzala. If the recommendation was to keep them CR wouldn't really need the two's thoughts
1554994196906558,2:46:41,Albert Noah,Why doesn't the Commission give a raised chair for the evidence leader. Standing for the whole day is like they are punishing the evidence leader....
1554994206498206,2:46:51,Mzalwane Mzala,@Pheladi Lamola My point exactly
1554994244098653,2:47:28,Magda Seguin,Amen...it's the only commission where the evidence leader stands the whole day!
1554994260676688,2:47:45,peter pott,"@noah, lol! he must stsnd, he made us wait for six weeks for this evidence.lol"
1554994284235223,2:48:08,Magda Seguin,The venue is not accommodating
1554994285591407,2:48:09,Eslon Eslon,The only person that openly supported CR17 is uncle Gwede Mantashe
1554994349407655,2:49:14,Magda Seguin,Gwede goes where the wind blows...he was an ardent Zuma supporter
1554994359515376,2:49:23,Mzalwane Mzala,Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi have until Tuesday to make representations to President Cyril Ramaphosa in response to a report into their fitness to hold office in the (NPA). (News24)
1554994393997222,2:49:58,Wildthing,here we go
1554994460514630,2:51:05,Corrie Botha,......😎
1554994470640074,2:51:15,EDDIE ZONDI Masilo,end game for Snake and Snail😁
1554994488174702,2:51:32,Mzalwane Mzala,@Eslon Eslon That on its own reduces @Cerebis' 4
1554994531925600,2:52:17,peter pott,"@eddie zondi, big name you carry here"
1554994552969206,2:52:37,Eslon Eslon,Since we are left to speculate. I would assume perhaps judge Mokgoro decide to leave option dismissal solely for the president to do or apply his mind independently
1554994568664596,2:52:53,Maleke Matshingwane,"Robert must be accountable for the office he occupied as the head of IPID by then, that is a big office important for our country why was he quiet all the times and trying to justify today!??"
1554994598713263,2:53:23,Cerebis,Nope it does not....I agree with Magda on hashtag Mantashe
1554994686418901,2:54:50,Maleke Matshingwane,"People like him are playing more political games, trying to mislead the commission."
1554994702673885,2:55:07,Mzalwane Mzala,I give up @Cerebis . Some of us were not watching from a distance bu were involved in the campaigns.
1554994704341381,2:55:09,Musa Bakiti,do not let him out he wasted our time
1554994717536752,2:55:22,peter pott,"common sense must just prevail. the is a new sheriff in town. both jiba and mrwebi cannot work with this sheriff. ie Jiba relegates willie to backbenches, batohi place him back to frontline. 1st fight"
1554994745729287,2:55:50,Andre Gerber,Makgoro report will only be released after Ramaphosa let us know whether Jiba and Mrwebi is staying/going
1554994774689437,2:56:18,Magda Seguin,Mc Bride was interviewed but obviously IPID being founded on confidentiality he could not shout it to the world...most of the people who came forward didn't make a noise
1554994804886006,2:56:49,Magda Seguin,If they made a noise it would have given fuel to fire to vilify them more
1554994819865625,2:57:04,Magda Seguin,Context in this commission is crucial
