1553679837199577,1:43:03,Neil Fraser,@Cameron Kim That's the job of this commission and not mine. Seems that there are many commenting here who know more than the lawyers int his inquiry
1553679841683889,1:43:08,Derek Main,@Cameron Kim Yep - they have too much baggage too.
1553679847096443,1:43:13,Cameron Kim,@Mapoto Ntuli YES brother - trust NO politician

1553679900387273,1:44:06,Thulani Bukani,I wonder why Fils and the guy from yesterday with the EFF pic are never online at the same time. Im sure it would be quite entertaining to see them go head to head. Perhaps they are the same person?
