1603800888433306,16:06,Mzalwane Mzala,I don't know @Anne M. but this does not end the instability. Tshwane does not have a mayor the 3 biggest parties are all fielding a candidate so no one will get a 50% plus one support.

1603800996983240,17:56,Anne M.,@Mzalwane Mzala So the municipal elections will have to be held for a possible solution?

1603801119109054,19:58,Mzalwane Mzala,The DA's case was against the city being run by an administrator and the court agreed with them.
1603801129681863,20:07,Hub Grasstruths,Every operative in the state organs has gone through a rigorous process to ensure they are sufficiently parasitic and without any signs of integrity. If they blow a whistle ask only one thing:..
1603801139224893,20:16,Anne M.,@LionView Correct plus she has not been found guilty in a court. Only the boy who thinks he's the prosecutor and judge.

1603801152605415,20:30,Hub Grasstruths,how and why did you find yourself in a position to observe the theft and how long did you wait to bloow the whistle
1603801166464955,20:41,Mzalwane Mzala,@Anne M. If there is no compromise elections will be the only option.
1603801236837212,21:56,Simphiwe Kubheka,"@Thando Cezula, no of the above!"
