1607339793570030,-1:00:16,Diane Louw,Ms Daniels should have legal presentation at this enquiry.
1607340136546342,-54:33,Heather Durr,@Diane Louw Not sure what they are getting at-that is standard wording for a minute/submission. Very often not 100% accurate esp in non essential matters
1607340174158628,-53:55,Heather Durr,wonder if there have been complaints re Koko and that she is not being handled strongly enought
1607340389347401,-50:20,Naledi Barron,"@Heather Durr I missed the ""kerfuffle"" with Koko. Can you recall what day it happened, and I'll go and check it out?"
1607340460941438,-49:08,M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily,It's up to her to seek an attorney to try protect her from hanging herself with the rope offered by Zondo and Seleke. The perjury that she's committing here will lead to her being arrested for perjury
1607340508381372,-48:21,Heather Durr,@Naledi Barron 3 December Evening session Mentioned under Koko
1607340509332019,-48:20,Diane Louw,@Heather Durr the only thing that i can assume is that they know she did not write those reports/memos and they are trying to find out who did and hopes she reveal it
1607340530318353,-47:59,Naledi Barron,Thank you @Heather Durr !! x

1607346222816970,46:39,Bongane Lephatsoa,This Daniels......üôÑüôÑ. Something fishy here

1607346225422755,46:41,Edward Baloyi,Ms Daniels is showing some incompetency in answering questions
1607346227395289,46:43,ALTA,@Sanfran Arnold exactly
1607346239583847,46:56,Margareth Waterboer,@Diana Louw...a secretary prepares what is DICTATED to her.. It‚Äôs not her decision!

1607346265351770,47:21,Diane Louw,lol @Naledi Barron
1607346267644905,47:23,les gp,"@Angelo Doubel She will be left with the sack. Remember that Boards are constituted by multiple disciplines. Entrepreneurs, and any other skilled individuals required for a board to function."
1607346275880644,47:32,Angelo Doubel,@les gp okay point noted
1607346289007113,47:45,Heather Durr,@les @Diane Louw I am stunned by all these obligations and powers Cosec has
1607346289799806,47:46,SD Gudunkomo,@Bongane I said that this one is a liar
1607346308425510,48:03,Brightwell Kunene,"Diana Louw, she is company secretary as in legal and compliance, not just a recording secretary"
1607346310306903,48:05,Diane Louw,@Margareth Waterboer hence all the questions about who made the changes...
1607346316261429,48:11,les gp,"@Angelo Doubel It's going to be a tough sell for courts to place the blame at ""Dudu Myeni"" if there is a Company Secretary on the Board. They have enormous powers. Even to report boards."
1607346327648936,48:23,Kido Kids,She's s not just a secretary she's a company sec and give guidance to governance issues
1607346327754608,48:23,roza,Naledi dont forget my juice plz
1607346332421761,48:29,Kelly Mpande,This lady was used to do dirty for same ppl
1607346335353159,48:32,Diane Louw,@Heather Durr we learn daily of these changes - mind boggling....
1607346356380611,48:52,ALTA,@Naledi Barron a tripple pleeeeeeze
1607346361282449,48:58,Naledi Barron,@Roza E No worries! Mango?Orange? Apple?
1607346362707436,48:59,les gp,"@Angelo Doubel Board members and especially the C.S. is expected to be a strong individual who is empowered to ""Protect"" the board, and by implication the Assets of the shareholders."
1607346365462952,49:01,dee dee cocroft,for the board to function 100 % all on board must be corrupt.
1607346375292207,49:10,Naledi Barron,@ALTA Coming up skat!
1607346392500309,49:29,Sal SA,Why was she meeting people if she was Company Secretary
1607346396680725,49:32,ALTA,@Naledi Barron ü§ó
1607346398879131,49:35,Bongane Lephatsoa,Daniels came with mentality to come and implicates others as scapegoats. She didnt see this kind of questioning coming her way
1607346409967808,49:46,Brightwell Kunene,"At best she is complicit to the wrong things that happened at ESKOM, as company secretary, she has significant responsibility"
1607346412836860,49:49,Angelo Doubel,@les gp tjo üò± so we have a long way to go. before anyone will goes to jail.
1607346413855039,49:50,roza,Naledi apple plz
1607346421775819,49:58,les gp,"This lady was clearly a AA candidate... at least thats what she wants us to believe. Like she was a ditzy blond... Unfortunately as a Prescribed office, she has no defence. Dudu Myeni has better odds"
1607346433391998,50:10,Diane Louw,and why was she then sent to a meeting to take minutes if she is a company secretary - thats then beneath her..... imho
1607346437969223,50:14,Naledi Barron,"@Roza E Fresh for you, with a sprig of mint x"
1607346438319306,50:15,M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily,She so much hopes to not be asked extremely difficult and self-implicating questions - and she's currently winning.
1607346448194339,50:24,Heather Durr,@Angelo Doubel A claim for damages depends on many more things than resolutions-it depends on fraud or negligence
1607346448375524,50:24,Cooler Cat,Guys a company secretary is a company's lawyer let's be clear on that please
1607346457272442,50:33,Ndivhuho Maxwell,"Is this a credible witness? I just don't see her as someone who's helping the commision, all she's doing is trying to save her skin."
1607346457295343,50:33,roza,Nalediüòò
1607346462588256,50:39,les gp,"@Angelo Doubel I don't think anyone will anyway. Perhaps she may, but unlikely that this farce will lead to anyone of real authority."
1607346465653803,50:41,SD Gudunkomo,DCJ will be active on Friday
1607346481493029,50:57,les gp,@Heather Durr Agreed
1607346481696904,50:57,Las Raxis,"Will all this processes reach prosecution, and if so, will everyone found guilty still be alive to serve their times?"
1607346490070567,51:06,nicholai Draai,I'm a Bad liar! Bad Liar! Now you know. You're free to go
1607346493527529,51:10,SanFran Arnold,@Ndivhuho Maxwell that is exactly what she is doing
1607346512863359,51:29,Naledi Barron,@Cooler Cat Is that a given? Can a Company Secretary NOT also be a lawyer. @Heather Durr - your opinion please?
1607346547491768,52:03,les gp,"@Heather Durr @Angelo Doubel However the C.S. in this case has her goose cooked. She's at the scene of the crime, she did nothing to mitigate the risks.. She can't cry wolf. She's a definite gonna!"
1607346556998015,52:13,Angelo Doubel,@Heather Durr so we have a long way to go. before anyone will be prosecuted
1607346562264079,52:18,Edward Baloyi,@Roza E its nice being here
1607346571699339,52:28,Heather Durr,@Naledi Barron @Cooler Cat Yes they can be as they are two separate functions
1607346580125541,52:36,Ndivhuho Maxwell,"@SanFran Arnold, I've noticed that's where she is going with this. Anything that may incriminate her, she tries her best to avoid it.."
1607346586980623,52:44,roza,Edward u welcome sir
1607346594181696,52:50,Naledi Barron,Thank you @Heather Durr x
1607346597872789,52:54,M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily,@Ndivhuho Maxwell And Shamila Batohi will help save her skin - she will not go after her - the colour of her skin makes her deserve to not be further investigated
1607346610856979,53:06,Sal SA,In my opinion a CS is not the legal advisor to the Board. Even if he/she is a qualified legal person
1607346639128477,53:35,Angelo Doubel,@les gp tjoüò±üò±üò±
1607346654379955,53:51,roza,is ms daniels not here to give direction on the emails nd letters
1607346659969863,53:57,les gp,@Heather Durr Explain..hahaha
1607346662783474,54:00,Naledi Barron,"@Sal SA Exactly, as @Heather Durr explained earlier."
1607346666445911,54:04,SanFran Arnold,"@Ndivhuho Maxwell the parliamentary committee said so, that she is only giving this evidence to cover her tracks"
1607346686971603,54:23,SanFran Arnold,@Sal SA correct
1607346696311973,54:31,Brightwell Kunene,"Sal SA she has that responsibility, to ensure the board act only legally, she is also delegated by the board to obtain legal opinion on board matters. You want to absolve her and pin this on others"
1607346701792597,54:38,Sal SA,@les gp. Legal opinion is not a CS duty as per the Companies Act
1607346704429326,54:40,Richard Evans,@Sal SA a CS is definitely not a legal advisor to the board
1607346710059081,54:46,Ndivhuho Maxwell,"@M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily, I also think that Mr Seleka is weak or soft. Or maybe he is doing that because she's supposedly helping the Commision to get the ""culprits""?"
1607346715041200,54:51,SanFran Arnold,The COSEC does not sit on the board in any function
1607346730428083,55:06,Angelo Doubel,@Heather Durr why articulate this about @les gp?
1607346756443960,55:33,Ndumie Ndlovu,Praveen your heroes knew nothing and now this traitor as well
1607346760001247,55:36,les gp,"@Sal SA Per the act, their roles are briefly the following: Provide directors with guidance as to Duties, Responsibilities and Powers. Those are all legal"
1607346771207066,55:47,Heather Durr,@Sal SA Exactly-you have a Group/Senior Legal Adviser and Cosec only sits in board meetings to take minutes and not give advice
1607346805104441,56:21,Brightwell Kunene,"If you were listening earlier she said so herself Sal SA, she had that responsibility at eskom"
1607346822577044,56:39,Sal SA,@Les gp. yes only in implementing the law

1607346880265199,57:36,Heather Durr,@Angelo Doubel He has overstated the role of Cosec to that of a Board Member

1607346925134010,58:20,Naledi Barron,"@Cooler Cat A succinct difference. But I hear you, thank you !"
1607346925979049,58:21,les gp,@Sal SA.. to know of which laws... Corruption for instance. The use of and meaning of the PFMA in SOE's etc. Those are all legal laws they are expected to at least understand enough to ADVISE
1607346926698892,58:22,Gugulethu Dube,Any one who doubts state capture with so much evidence presented is not ignorant but an collaborator or enabler. There is too much evidence & the involvement Koko and Daniels the question is of degree
1607346954216722,58:50,Sal SA,@Brightwell Kunene. Definitely not
1607346961536571,58:57,Angelo Doubel,@Heather Durr what's role of Cosec?
1607346967960495,59:03,les gp,@Sal SA ... That makes that role very very legal heavy. It's not a position to be held by someone who is not at the least prepared to learn of the legislation that governs that industry.
1607346976595481,59:13,les gp,@Sal SA Can we agree to that?
1607346997004715,59:33,Minnib Prince,hahaha....anniversary. ..Lol Mr Seleka

1607347123786326,1:01:40,Angelo Doubel,@Heather Durr can miss Daniels be held accountable for these deals?

1607347254989715,1:03:52,Heather Durr,@Angelo Doubel No unless they prove fraud or gross negligence on her part and even then the Board is the responsible party as they sign off on it
