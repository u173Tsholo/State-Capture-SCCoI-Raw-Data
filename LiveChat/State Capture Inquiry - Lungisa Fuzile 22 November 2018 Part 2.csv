1542895664216018,2:03:19,dawie botha,vote eff and loot another bank and your comrades are stealing your goats
1542895719384088,2:04:14,Tumi Molale,even scarier than TN's suggestion
1542895738515261,2:04:33,Syanda Ntozini,@Thando tell me of one country that was a democratic country and is now back to the olden days of oppression because of new leadership?
1542895796550749,2:05:31,Syanda Ntozini,"Mayor Herman Mashaba revealed affordable housing for the people of Gauteng yesterday, that’s the work of the DA by the way."
1542895865622877,2:06:41,Syanda Ntozini,"So @Thando, Cape Town has apartheid laws?"

1542895964579331,2:08:19,Syanda Ntozini,It’s sad but that’s what’s happening now @Leon
1542896033360091,2:09:28,Leon Van Zyl,"All i can say is toe the line my fellow south Africans, we all win or we all lose."
1542896075624567,2:10:10,Syanda Ntozini,Another thing...I would not want my son to behave like the EFF does in Parliament. They resort to noise and violent if better points are raised against them mxm.
1542896098134591,2:10:33,Leon Van Zyl,if we tolerate this then your children will be next.
1542896126496779,2:11:01,Syanda Ntozini,Lol Thando go ahead do that. I don’t get why for me 2 be black means I should associate with the hooliganism of the EFF?

1542896274394472,2:13:29,Syanda Ntozini,EFF is the most racist party I’ve seen so far.
1542896325294440,2:14:20,Syanda Ntozini,"Typical EFF, resorting to swearing and violent."
1542896332167621,2:14:27,Tumi Molale,will never vote for DA and will never support anybody in bed with DA.
1542896388194426,2:15:23,Syanda Ntozini,"Tumi’ if u stay in PTA, Gauteng or Cape Town, you’re ruled by the DA"
1542896439533453,2:16:14,Syanda Ntozini,"Just like in 2019 the party for all people will rule, the only party ran by a pastor."
1542896463021500,2:16:37,Leon Van Zyl,The more we fight the more we loose.

1542896959973152,2:24:55,Syanda Ntozini,It saddens me that the EFF is led by people who are educated and intelligent but act barbaric in Parliament. I feel sorry for my fellow brothers who see nothing wrong with their behavior 😒😒
