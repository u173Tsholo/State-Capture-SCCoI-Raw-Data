1538568309044351,2:07,mfumo walter maluleke,where is the volume
1538568571895942,6:30,Andrew Mabele,contradicting statements...this guy must be charged immediately.Purgery
1538568744217286,9:22,MASAMBAG,which contradicting statement are you on about Andrew ?
1538568837420995,10:56,Danie van Rensburg,Andrew is a BLF agnet
1538568944533203,12:43,sbusiso mzobe,where is Dali Mpofu he would have fun getting sharp answers from Nene
1538568974352254,13:13,Giftlebohang,"Nene- In April, 2017 had an interview where he indicated that he never met Guptas but bumped to them. Today, apparently, he conceded to meet Ajay Gupta after being invited for tea."
1538569010550278,13:49,The Vuka Experience,He‚Äôs being more honest that previous statements. I think he understands the outcomes will have harsh implications on him.
1538569027231622,14:05,Wesley M,"look we had the freedom struggle, apartheid, disadvantage, white monopoly etc. but Jacob Zuma was a disaster!!!!!!"
1538569078601248,14:57,Wesley M,he does devious things for fun.
1538569089426975,15:08,Alex Mbontsi,@King Vuka....so basically Mr Nene lies depending what outcome suits him?
1538569144669771,16:03,Desmond Masilela,They ask him question then he respond by reading from his script.....
1538569156494812,16:15,ndieni rasikhuthuma,Minister Nene saved this country period
1538569200105441,16:58,The Vuka Experience,"@Alex Mbontsi basically ewe, it seems like he lied under Zuma to protect himself and keep face. He is no longer under Zuma so it‚Äôs in his best interest to be honest."
1538569288734818,18:27,Alex Mbontsi,I still think he is being selective to ensure that he is not implicated
1538569345037521,19:23,The Vuka Experience,"@Alex Mbontsi that might be the case yes, at least he‚Äôs admitting to things he previously denied knowledge of like meeting the Guptas and favours."
1538569351149317,19:29,Alex Mbontsi,Yes he repented that I believe but he must not come play us to imply that he was not part of the group
1538569404080520,20:22,Teboho Khiba,why is he selecting information he thinks is important to us.
1538569419868556,20:38,The Vuka Experience,"Well there are more people to come and testify, his testimony will be tested."
1538569455241623,21:13,The Vuka Experience,Remember Duduzane also agreed to appear and testify. This is gonna get hotter.
1538569464087026,21:22,Alex Mbontsi,I‚Äôm still to understand what he considered the Guptas as before they were a ‚Äúhot potato‚Äù and my assumption is he would say we were friends but saying that now would put him in a bad light
1538569619332860,23:58,Kingsley Mathe,"If you want to save your skin do like they did during the eskom inquiry, blame it all on the Guptas..."
1538569639297535,24:17,Alex Mbontsi,As I see it...Mr Nene was part of the clique until the Guptas took it too far and he knew that he was in too deep and he started being uncooperative
1538569739071188,25:57,Desmond Masilela,Whose next after Nene? because i dont see where we are going with Nene..honestly
1538569823625660,27:21,Alex Mbontsi,Let‚Äôs be honest...The South African government is rotten so as the private sector
1538569853883495,27:52,Alex Mbontsi,State Capture goes beyond the time of Zuma
1538569869901176,28:08,Aijaman Pirlo,When GUPTAS was chowing money with Zuma like nobodies business. Petrol was cheaper... BRING BACK GUPTAS
1538569889282118,28:27,Aijaman Pirlo,Petrol iyadura bakithi
1538569899560727,28:38,The Vuka Experience,Aijaman üòÇüòÇüòÇüòç
1538569921264724,28:59,Desmond Masilela,Yes @Wonga Masiza
1538569956757017,29:35,abraham rambuda,oh my... that young lady that is seating near Mr Pretorius. Can someone get me her number please. lol
1538569989885862,30:08,Alex Mbontsi,@Wonga Masiza ...I fully agree but after this we have to go back before Zuma because the issue with SA is structural
1538570035320175,30:54,Delphin kapeta,Who knows the girl sitting next to counsel?
1538570040042042,30:58,Piet Madimetja,the course of expensive petrol and tax is because of Zuma and his friends
1538570052180674,31:10,Skhumbuzo Nkosi,@abraham she's hot
1538570077274449,31:35,abraham rambuda,@Wonga Masiza even if I promise the position in cabinet you won't give me her name and number?
1538570118564782,32:17,abraham rambuda,@Skhumbuzo Nkosi yes broer don't wanna lie. she is too hot
1538570124581870,32:23,Aijaman Pirlo,Peit you lie
1538570137079703,32:35,Mpho Mashigo,This NUCLEAR program has the potential to power half of Africa... and this fool has delayed it... coal is running out in mpumalanga and we have huge deposits of uranium üò≥
1538570146339900,32:44,Aijaman Pirlo,Bring back GUPTAS and Zuma..Petrol was cheap under them.....
1538570172388327,33:11,Slindile Ngcobo,"She's what you call :BEAUTY and BRAINS"""
1538570187471101,33:25,Auti Mjita,@Aijaman Pirlo Are you stupid or just trying hard to sound stupid?
1538570223570187,34:02,Mbudzeni Mphaphuli,"We owe Nene a great deal for not signing the Nuclear deal, our children would have been left with the debt that they would have to service."
1538570223966148,34:02,abraham rambuda,Yes @Slindile Ngcobo it's so true
1538570241271259,34:19,Auti Mjita,"@Mpho Mashigo And who would have paid your social grant? the country would have been broke, goes to show who bought data for you"
1538570266448893,34:45,Aijaman Pirlo,Everthing is expensive these days yet we are still blaming other people. When you corrupt squandering money. You immidiately suffer because the money is not properly channelled. Whe we only suffer now
1538570293201257,35:11,Thiza William,if we go back preZuma era till when its the cut time of investigation?
1538570324594850,35:43,Auti Mjita,@Aijaman Pirlo The fact that you don't recognize continuity in policy and governance disqualifies you from commenting on ish you are clearly ignorant about
1538570326411410,35:44,Aijaman Pirlo,They say petrol is expensive because of Zuma. Why it was not expensive that time because Zuma was corrupt with his friends including Nene.
1538570347042833,36:05,Aijaman Pirlo,Why we only suffer now? Why now not at that time when Guptas were taking everything
1538570366308472,36:24,Crispian Gallon,We definitely need to thank Nene. Otherwise we would have been downgraded even further. And the next generation would have to pay as well
1538570388462417,36:46,Auti Mjita,"@Aijaman Pirlo Ask your Zuma why PetroSA sold our strategic fuel reserves, he approved it, at below market rates, even when oil prices where at their lowest"
1538570400596850,36:59,Aijaman Pirlo,Rand lost value more than it was during the corruption of Guptas and Zuma. Why it never lost value that time?
1538570411967505,37:10,abraham rambuda,@Wonga Masiza are you serious bro?
1538570438686846,37:36,Mpho Mashigo,BRICS was going to fund it... that's why Zuma joined BRICS... The IMF is RAPING AFRICA
1538570450902131,37:49,Aijaman Pirlo,Auti irrespective of Zuma selling PetroSA strategic what what. Fact is Petrol was cheaper as compared to now. Why it was not expensive at that time?
1538570461065109,37:59,Thokozani Malgas,"That's my wife you guys talking about, just focus on pretorious & nene"
1538570501717533,38:40,abraham rambuda,@Thokozani Malgas oh you wish broer
1538570519332872,38:57,Auti Mjita,"@Aijaman Pirlo FACT is you are ignorant about fuel prices, don't comment on things youknow nothing about, it makes you sound DOM bra, ask and we will explain"
1538570520527595,38:58,Aijaman Pirlo,"I warn South Africans, this inquiry is just a smokescreen to confuse people"
1538570540906594,39:19,Thiza William,There's no fiends but intetests if you think China is our saviour unless you don't understand international relations or outright gullible
1538570557408941,39:35,Nhlamulo Ngonyama,sabc 404 needs audio please.
1538570560409254,39:38,Dimakatso Nwandula,"@Aijiman Pirlo the intellectual incapacity of your statements shock, I hope your paid to be this dumb"
1538570588081395,40:06,Auti Mjita,nywe nywe fuel prices where lower under Zuma but you forget that they were even lower under Mohlanthe and Mbeki
1538570590681220,40:09,nhlayisi owen magayisa,i wonder if we still have people who are ground standing the corruption of zuma's administration..
1538570598629145,40:17,abraham rambuda,No @Wonga Masiza my wife would kill me if she sees this. I am just joking
1538570615612124,40:34,Mpho Mashigo,Petrol is expensive because the USA has sanctioned IRAN and BRITISH PETROLEUM (BP) GETS ITS OIL FROM Iranüò≥
1538570619155891,40:37,Aijaman Pirlo,"Auti Mjita - I've been driving since I was 23 now I am 39. I can easily tell the difference on petrol price. Under Zuma, petrol was cheaper compared now. Ndiyaxoka nhaa???"
1538570670187816,41:28,Auti Mjita,@Aijaman PirloIt is sad to see an old man without an ounce of brains but let me clarify
1538570685571506,41:43,Thiza William,"surely before Zuma the bread was cheaper, inflation was lower, petrol was lower as standard as was petrol in 1994"
1538570689461769,41:47,Aijaman Pirlo,This inquiry is just a smokescreen to play dirty politics. We won't benefit anything out of this nonsense
1538570695381002,41:54,Aijaman Pirlo,Mark my words
1538570697122509,41:55,Mpho Mashigo,SAA is in trouble because they stole it's planes ... tell people the Truth Neneüò°üò°üò°
1538570712241019,42:10,Auti Mjita,"1. No president sets fuel prices, they are determined by market forces and whatever tax the nation picks to have included in the price"
1538570742457131,42:40,Thiza William,Some need to understand economics its so sad to witness such ignorance
1538570745555953,42:43,Desmond Masilela,Fully agree with you @Aijaman Pirlo
1538570753171436,42:51,Auti Mjita,"2. Check where the ZAR was irt the dollar during Zuma years, and before you sound dom again, the ish that Zuma got up to in office let to the state we are in today"
1538570776703257,43:15,Desmond Masilela,This Inquiry is just like TRC..
1538570784453828,43:22,Thiza William,litre of petrol in 1994 was three rand
1538570786896080,43:25,Aijaman Pirlo,True Desmond
1538570791210519,43:29,Mpho Mashigo,THE DOLLAR IS A SCAM. NOT GOLD BACKED NIX
1538570791861624,43:29,Auti Mjita,"3. what made things worse now is that the orange man in the states has decided to cut off IRAN, from supplying oil to the rest of the world, pushing up crude oil prices"
1538570808749873,43:47,Desmond Masilela,Thank you @Aijaman Pirlo
1538570819353093,43:57,abraham rambuda,@Aijaman Pirlo actually you are not lying but exposing your stupidity and ignorance. There are many circumstances that play into the issue of petrol as like international oil prices and the rand
1538570856090128,44:34,Aijaman Pirlo,Auti Mjita might think he is smart thinking that we will benefit something out of this nonsense. Mark my words. 2019 will come and go and nothing will have been done by that time
1538570856334455,44:34,Nhlamulo Ngonyama,audio on Sabc 404 is still not coming through and data is still expensive. production team please help
1538570898194913,45:16,Auti Mjita,@Aijaman Pirlo Are we still talking about your hero zuma or have you moved on to 2019?
1538570908689253,45:27,Aijaman Pirlo,Black people do not fly all the time. We use buses when we cross country. I do not care about SAA.
1538570933687963,45:52,Aijaman Pirlo,I did not fly for 15 years yet black people are made to be so concerned about SAA and forget the major issues
1538570959664094,46:18,Auti Mjita,"@Aijaman Pirlo Black people do fly, you don't fly, and we all do care about SAA because it is a national asset. Maybe the blacks you know do not fly"
1538570971619021,46:30,The Vuka Experience,"@Aijaman, what bus goes to Brazil?"
1538571007296014,47:05,Aijaman Pirlo,Not even a single Airbus which fall off the sky yet we so focused on it. Lets talk about Jobela buses and City to City buses and their standards because people die all the time on the road
1538571037797946,47:36,Crispian Gallon,@Pirlo even if we dont use SAA we the taxpayers paid for it.
1538571062955614,48:01,Auti Mjita,"@Aijaman Pirlo It seems you have a lot of issues to raise, I wish you would focus on one, educate yourself so you don't sound like a stupid old man"
1538571064618183,48:03,Aijaman Pirlo,We are black lets be concerned about issues which hit the poorest. Some-1 in Alexandra doesn't even know where is OR Tambo in JHB but that person is made to worry about SAA not City City
1538571073965576,48:12,The Vuka Experience,@Aijama if there is a link between the state capture and buses we‚Äôll hear about it. You are too woke!
1538571124339328,49:02,Auti Mjita,"@King Vuka He is a sleepyist bra, you know these people who get free data to say nonsense on public plaforms"
1538571171804844,49:50,Aijaman Pirlo,"Lets all come back here after this hearing and debate. Believe me, there will be nothing to debate about just like the inquiry of Marikana massacre. This is waste of time and resources"
1538571186075712,50:03,Aijaman Pirlo,uZuma uyityile imali uyityile. Akangowokuqala!!!!
1538571188283076,50:06,Auti Mjita,"@Aijaman Pirlo Tell that to your Zuma who was in power for over 9 years, what has he done for those people you talk about?"
1538571222024434,50:40,Aijaman Pirlo,He did nothing just like the presidents before him. Just like Ramaphosa is doing now
1538571227572930,50:45,Auti Mjita,"@Aijaman Pirlo FYI, the Marikana commission did it's work, however your BFF Zuma shelved the report"
1538571253808864,51:12,Crispian Gallon,@Pirlo. in simple terms buy now pay later
1538571296984990,51:55,Thiza William,Something doesn't add up with reasoning capacity of Zuma supporters
1538571309474948,52:07,Auti Mjita,"@Bongile Sibali We are trying to educate those that receive free Zupta data so they can go around sanging Zuma praises, thinking that the rest of us have boloko in our heads like them"
1538571341964629,52:40,Aijaman Pirlo,The widows of Marikana mine workers are yet to be paid anything till today. Now you say BFF is holding the payment
1538571344242433,52:42,Aijaman Pirlo,yhoooo
1538571378696683,53:16,Auti Mjita,"@Aijaman Pirlo Your BFF did not act of the report, ask him why not."
1538571482432767,55:01,Aijaman Pirlo,So BFF got powers of holding governments payments?
1538571489784419,55:08,Aijaman Pirlo,hehehehehehe hay yhoooo
1538571525244438,55:43,Aijaman Pirlo,"I am repeating, nothing we will gain out of this. So many commisions we saw before this and nothing was ever done"

1538571527457377,55:46,Auti Mjita,"@Aijaman Pirlo Not payments bra, he received a report, with recommendations from the Marikana commission, what did he do with that report?"
1538571542507574,56:01,Xhanti Silvester,I came to sabc streaming to ask for the lady sitting next to the advocates 10 digits at enca they dont have
1538571557284763,56:15,Auti Mjita,"Plus his government promised the Marikana widows cash, did he follow through with that promise?"
1538571575766380,56:34,Aijaman Pirlo,I remember when Andries Tatane passed on. There was a commision. What happened after that commision?
1538571577778857,56:36,Aijaman Pirlo,Nothing

1538571712062132,58:50,Aijaman Pirlo,Auti Mjita - you think you smart as a result you don't look at reality. Mbeki squandered the FIFA money under the disguise of African diaspora. Mandela and his group of stellenbosch was corrupt
1538571740652544,59:19,Rose Gadibolae,ijooy zupta

1538571775842284,59:54,Thiza William,Once beaten twice shy. Sua forces must be fought in all platforms of our open society and exposed for how destructive they're
1538571778442691,59:57,Aijaman Pirlo,Every president we once had was corrupt. De Klerk funded the killings in Boipatong and PolaPark..No commision ever established to look at these previous presidents
1538571821703778,1:00:40,Auti Mjita,"@Aijaman Pirlo now we are on Mbeki and 2010, pick one and stick to it so we can educate you...these whataboutism that you keep bringing up will only confuse you further"
1538571834917469,1:00:53,Aijaman Pirlo,but Zuma was corrupt just like them. There is commision. Why because 2019 is around the corner and this commision is just a smokescreen
1538571844843036,1:01:03,Zwelethu Ayanda Sodwele,@Aijaman...Can we just catch the fish we can for now

1538571877436238,1:01:36,Thiza William,Bringing the past shows a poverty of discussion. Engage on the current narrative being presented than diversionary tactic
1538571885752822,1:01:44,Sindiswa Moolman,He is earning his normal salary. This is not extra for him.

1538571917046334,1:02:15,makhosi nobhatyi,Zuma uses white as they are capturing treasure where he wants to push them away and capture state by himself
1538571924161429,1:02:22,Auti Mjita,@Aijaman Pirlo THE ONLY ONE CONFUSED HERE IS YOU BROTHER
1538571926760127,1:02:25,Mkitlane Simon,Zulu and English

1538572000791336,1:03:39,Zwelethu Ayanda Sodwele,Im sure some politicians are crossing fingers that their names aren't dropped
1538572002155181,1:03:40,peter pott,"when people are in trouble, they throw in Zuma names to save their skin. why didn't you resign since you refused to sign nuclear deal"
