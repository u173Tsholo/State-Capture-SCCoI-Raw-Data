1562569198961885,-1:04:06,Jason Manganyi,Ambassador Bruce koloane
1562569447823147,-59:57,PETER STAFFEN,are they starting at nine or ten
1562570049831933,-49:55,Jason Manganyi,According to the website they'll start at 10
1562570239260291,-46:46,MJ,They must declare a national holiday when Zuma appears before the commission!
1562570697252598,-39:08,MJ,I Agree Yin Yang!
1562570748229049,-38:17,Sindiswa Moolman,It’s gonna be a chaos on 25 July with all Zuma bussed-in supporters making noise and blocking roads outside the venue
1562570915288315,-35:30,MJ,My favourite food to eat while I watch this mess unfold is biltong and avo.....no popcorn!
1562570998674498,-34:06,Pastor J.J,@MJ Odendaal Jorgensen On crispy toast and some salty bacon just forkicks. My all time favourite
1562571182168828,-31:03,MJ,"Pastor J, you take it too far!"
1562571454498232,-26:31,clive oconnell,Why can’t this court do a full days productive business
1562571932655220,-18:32,Maxwell Sibiya,"@Yin Yang, MJ, Pastor J, when Zuma comes, he will deny everything like he always does. blame white monopoly capital, blame ppl fighting corruption, And every1 corrupt or stupid will be supporting him."
1562572106314590,-15:39,Pastor J.J,@Maxwell Sibiya .You are spot on and indeed very right. Sadly everyone that has come to testify before him seem to tell the truth about him whilst he will chose to deny it all.
1562572651696676,-6:33,Magda Seguin,My mind was just refreshed that Mac Maharaj who was Presidency spokesperson at the time of the Gupta landing denied that Zuma gave the orders for the plane to land
1562572854313667,-3:11,Magda Seguin,Proceedings starting at 10:00

1562573000143555,-0:45,Mandy Pannack,"unless those found guilty of corruption have actual written or documented evidence that Zuma instructed them to implement state capture, Zuma will get off scott free."
1562573082622650,0:27,ACE MABEKA,yes he must mention names
1562573117591690,1:02,Mandy Pannack,"remember, he's a strategist...... he'll claim he wasn't involved directly and without direct evidence, everything will be heresay on the part of the accused"
1562573123150286,1:08,Thulani Bukani,today should be interesting

1562575234715351,36:19,Derek Main,@Yose Human I hate capitalism - it's a system for sociopaths.
1562575256658849,36:41,Derek Main,I rest my case.
1562575256691681,36:41,Magda Seguin,Zuma is a thief period.It has nothing to do with capitalism
1562575258949468,36:43,michael mbatha,I also thought Kholoane was to testify today. What is Matjila's role or position back then in the Gupta landing gate?
1562575262988332,36:47,Phindile Mbonani,@ Busang Tsotetsi Tsotetsi his full names is Jerry Matthews Matjila

1562575297466863,37:22,Joburg CEB Lion,"those who experience low volumes, go out and use another view"
1562575312592395,37:37,Magda Seguin,Why dont they address him on his name like any other witness
1562575344875381,38:09,Zamuxolo Mbangcolo,"I like this guy, he is a story teller. I would listen to him the whole day."
1562575370475816,38:35,Derek Main,"@Yose Human So in your opinion, capitalism is serving us just fine?"
1562575415760763,39:21,Derek Main,@Yin Yang Sounds like a kindergarten argument.
1562575451803807,39:57,peter pott,This is a waste of tax payers money. how come we fly two ambassadors home just to answer one question. we can just bring koloane to table to answer who gave him thumbs up for the landing
1562575457094591,40:02,Derek Main,@Yin Yang I'm not looking at just SA but the entire planet.
1562575484242784,40:29,Derek Main,@Yin Yang Like Is said - juvenile.

1562575648092063,43:13,Zola Pinda,This man must go teach this to international relations students. How did he allow Guptas at our army base.
1562575691180899,43:56,clive oconnell,Zuma enjoyed trips to Russia for bribes for Atomic power plants 💰💰💰
1562575731407442,44:36,Sindiswa Moolman,It’s not him who allowed that @Zila Pinda. That one is next.
1562575761848938,45:06,peter pott,"if we question landing, we chasing wrong dot. we need to inquire what did they offload?"
