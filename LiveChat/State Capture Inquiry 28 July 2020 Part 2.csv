1595937921053625,4:11,Roy Kisten,they should also have a body language specialist in the commission to see weather this idiot is lying
1595938017962523,5:47,Arthur Dell,Roy Kirtsen we all can see he is lying!!!
1595938090788316,6:59,Marcus Mmola,"The witness knows his story ,why not just charge him in a normal court of law."

1595938917764363,20:45,Xolisa Ndevu,this person is arrogant
1595938942051322,21:10,Dominic Przybylski,Sounds like he did no work at all.
1595938977675495,21:46,Richard Masigo,Arrogance won’t work here he must answer
1595938983790993,21:52,Gabisile Mahlangu,So arrogant!

1595939215385370,25:44,Bruce Thackwell,what an embarrassment to have a person like this in a senior government post. He has nothing but contempt.
1595939227062144,25:56,Cerebis,The fire pool guy is so arrogant because he knows he will walk Scot free from this whole thing. He is protected by Ace and his gang.
1595939292661327,27:01,Marcus Mmola,"Apologies,but the DCJ does not seem the right person to chair this commission,he is too accommodating to witnesses,waste of time,money!!"
1595939313107432,27:21,StarManRSA,@Marcus Mmola this is not a court of law
1595939361937056,28:12,Peet Venter,clearing your throat so persistently is an indicator of lies. As a police fundi you should know this but
1595939430663721,29:20,Zamile Hina,his style is working for now
1595939432603418,29:22,Dominic Przybylski,@Marcus Mmola It would be such a pleasure to see the judge walk over to witness and give him a snot clap whenever he wastes time or doesn't answer a question properly... afternoon fantasy.

1595939466027191,29:55,Moonchild,This Nhleko is ducking & diving & Judge Zondo is being too accommodating.

1595939523582768,30:53,StarManRSA,@Alvino Theunissen how is Zondo protecting Nhleko?

1595939590876070,32:00,Alvino Theunissen,by not letting the ADV completing his questioning and hurrying him up
1595939597389435,32:06,Bruce Thackwell,what a bla bla bla cover up
1595939617684542,32:26,mohapi mphatsoe,I think the chair is doing well in directing the proceedings

1595939632920134,32:42,Craig Johnson,Clearing throat is a sign of not telling the truth as his throat starts tightening up.
1595939646772461,32:56,Craig Johnson,The police service is a joke
1595939648518615,32:58,Alvino Theunissen,Correct @mohapi mphatsoe
1595939664084016,33:13,Moonchild,He's trying to creat rapport between him & Zondo & then pull the wool over his eyes. I sincerely hope Zondo can see through this!!!
1595939676552665,33:25,Cerebis,Zulu to Zulu jokes???
1595939692338817,33:41,Alvino Theunissen,Agree @ Kerry van Schalkwyk

1595939724803026,34:12,Hein de Wit,Body language says this guy is lying his ears off
1595939769919694,34:58,constantin buzdugan,it's all a parody of truth.....
1595939771080908,34:59,Bruce Thackwell,Never forget the trillions that have been defrauded from the South African Tax payer.
1595939776385212,35:05,Danie Vorster,i can go to the circus
1595939780402040,35:09,farouq,@ Hein de Wit ha ha ha. yep you got that right
1595939785199895,35:14,Moonchild,He continually will not answer the question in a straightforward way!!! This is really irritating now & I'm getting angry.
1595939788991359,35:18,Martin van der Breggen,Time for being civil is over - answer the bloody questions
1595939796279430,35:26,Cerebis,Was his water blessed by the so called Doom guy?
1595939812129220,35:41,Gift Mazibuko,trying to get Nhleko to tell the truth is like trying to draw blood from a stone
1595939820599811,35:49,Alvino Theunissen,@Mohamed...he is not actually intelligent but diverting it
1595939833736726,36:01,Moonchild,@Gift Mazibuko - absolutely agree
1595939839172322,36:07,DMF,"DCJ is very strategic, playing along and it is clear Mr Firepool is lying under oath."
1595939849009386,36:17,constantin buzdugan,they cover each other
1595939851762123,36:20,Bruce Thackwell,trained by the Chinese
1595939855813619,36:24,Sabata Kambule,Principles of ANC compromised the organization. This things could have been avoided should they interrogate their political appointments and the manner in which decisions were made.
1595939862749087,36:31,Martin van der Breggen,And we have not even started on the Secure in Comfort report yet
1595939876373191,36:45,constantin buzdugan,nobody will go to jail

1595939915814991,37:25,Bruce Thackwell,Zondo comes across a scared of him
1595939927850606,37:36,Cerebis,Why can this commission not deliver interim reports so that the NPA can start prosecutions?
1595939943123497,37:52,constantin buzdugan,parody of truth....
1595939963864651,38:12,Moonchild,"It's also very frustrating for the evidence leader, Hulley. Every time he tries to lead Nhleko, he gets interrupted by Zondo & Nhleko just diverts & goes off on a tangent!!"
1595939998977235,38:48,constantin buzdugan,zondo is protecting him
1595940010014822,38:59,Dominic Przybylski,@Cerebis It's frustrating. I wonder how Nugent would have handled this commission.
1595940064269463,39:52,Cerebis,@Dominic Przybylski Jip! He would and did issue interim reports in the SARS commission.
1595940126843423,40:55,Alvino Theunissen,"The Media i.e SABC, eNCA need to Scrutinize the Zondo on handling the cases!"
1595940189598116,41:59,Craven Morehead,Lol now he sounds very guilty
1595940239556757,42:48,constantin buzdugan,these characters are paid millions tax money....
1595940320736201,44:10,Malcolm Fredericks,"they all belong to one organisation ,dont trust them"
1595940392005284,45:21,Malcolm Fredericks,"what a comedy,eish"
1595940421917139,45:50,constantin buzdugan,actually it's very sad
1595940423807114,45:52,Bruce Thackwell,lives for lunch
1595940477967011,46:48,Moonchild,You can hear that even Zondo is bored with this long-winded testimony!
1595940492128680,47:01,Syug,Zondo is not a cadre. He is only doing his job albeit lethargically
1595940507161245,47:15,Freddy Mhembere,"Africa guys, Ma1 everyone is now corrupt, why ?"
1595940538955944,47:48,Bophelo Malapela,The nonsense on this platform questioning the integrity of DCJ Zondo because people do not understand legal processes is shocking
1595940564598907,48:13,DTM O,this is just an excuse to waste public money
1595940567866805,48:16,Craven Morehead,More friendly chats
1595940577872411,48:26,Mpotseng Lebentlele,RESPECT ZONDO........he is on top of his game
1595940581782717,48:31,Craven Morehead,Can we get back to work? Really Zondo this is wasting time
1595940588648621,48:37,Moonchild,This is really a comedy of errors! They spent most of the day sorting out the pagination instead of getting on with the testimony! Now they are talking about food!!! I can't anymore.
1595940598678349,48:48,constantin buzdugan,really???
1595940608711669,48:57,Bophelo Malapela,This is a commission not a court
1595940613784542,49:03,Gabisile Mahlangu,"Why is Zondo trying to play nice with this guy, so annoyed!"
1595940621928718,49:10,Moonchild,@Mpotseng Lebentlele - I agree but he needs to be more assertive now & enforce Nhleko to get on with it & answer the questions directly.
1595940640873150,49:30,constantin buzdugan,it's a tactic to get him clear
1595940660828728,49:48,constantin buzdugan,no shame
1595940704612299,50:33,constantin buzdugan,useless to watch further
1595940708640129,50:36,Bophelo Malapela,@Gabisile Mahlangu how would you expect DCJ Zondo to behave next he will be accused of not being fit to be a judge as did Lucky Montana
1595940765348229,51:34,Mpotseng Lebentlele,@Kerry van Schalkwyk I hear you and trust me he is about to corner him i believe
1595940770166803,51:41,constantin buzdugan,"talk ,no action"
1595940795841435,52:04,Dominic Przybylski,Perhaps Zondo should be wearing black leather with chains and a sjambok and give the witness a whipping every now and then.
1595940795885411,52:04,Moonchild,@Mpotseng Lebentlele - hope so 🙏
1595940818539267,52:27,constantin buzdugan,"carefully ,not to upset the witness...."
1595940857746423,53:07,constantin buzdugan,"it's useless,he has no shame"
1595940861851261,53:12,Cerebis,I wonder how many trees this commission has used up with all these files?
1595940869290608,53:18,Bophelo Malapela,@kerry van Schalkwyk you have your own perceptions of how DCJ Zondo should conduct himself care to share
1595940872229239,53:21,Siseko Yeki,this process is not just to punish but to save a state from capture... it should be done accurately to a microscopic levels.
1595940879775042,53:28,constantin buzdugan,sad...
1595940943685076,54:32,Bruce Thackwell,"The land of thieves and reports and cadres , cats out the bag! everybody knows you can run but cant hide!"
1595940977213859,55:06,Dominic Przybylski,Why hide when nobody ever gets prosecuted?
1595941015496240,55:43,albert 2100,lock them away they still the money and try to reconciling. ww want economic freedom . lock these people awy
1595941032742229,56:01,Gray Lawrence,am I the only one that thinks this guy is an idiot?
1595941043535900,56:13,Moonchild,@Bophelo Malapela - I think he needs to be more assertive with Nhleko who has been ducking & diving to avoid answering to the charges.
1595941046913932,56:16,Bruce Thackwell,Just swell up and explode on custard. Nice
1595941067868544,56:37,Siseko Yeki,This process is even better than that of the court of law
1595941089180689,56:58,Bophelo Malapela,@kerry van schalkwyk define assertive
1595941102654940,57:11,Mandy Phillips,@Siseko ... that's exactly why he is giving long winded strange responses
1595941141152336,57:51,Dominic Przybylski,He seems to have avoided doing any work or taking any responsibility at all... Now that's not a crime but surely this kind of person should never be a cabinet minister.
1595941160794549,58:10,Moonchild,"@Bophelo Malapela - if you don't know what assertive means, please look it up in a dictionary. Assertive as opposed to aggressive."

1595941361188057,1:01:29,Mpotseng Lebentlele,@Kerry van Schalkwyk it wasn't necessary to patronise @Bophelo Malapela like that.
1595941390117859,1:01:58,Bophelo Malapela,@kerry van schalkwyk from your meltdown I get the distinct impression you have no clue why nhleko is before the commission
1595941391258162,1:01:59,Bruce Thackwell,What law
1595941406643949,1:02:17,Dominic Przybylski,"2nd report indicates a revision of 1st report. Then obvious question is ""Why has the report been revised?"""
1595941410303564,1:02:20,Moonchild,@Bophelo Malapela - not at all. It is merely a question of him guiding this witness to answer the charges succinctly & directly. Nhleko is skirting the issues & we the tax-payers are paying for it.
1595941427770109,1:02:37,Moonchild,@Mpotseng Lebentlele @Bophelo Malapela - I won't dignify those comments with a response.
1595941470574160,1:03:19,Mpotseng Lebentlele,Le ya tena wa tseba
1595941472630614,1:03:20,Michael Holmes,he must just say he doesn't like to read
1595941487331499,1:03:36,Bophelo Malapela,It’s nhlehos own problem is he refuses to answer questions as that might comeback to haunt him
1595941516531035,1:04:05,PETER STAFFEN,MC bride is going to eat him
1595941518319579,1:04:07,Dominic Przybylski,So did you ask that question Mr Nhleko?
1595941586996407,1:05:15,Bruce Thackwell,Bivouacked on the brink of reason
1595941589556299,1:05:18,Bophelo Malapela,Nhleko is here responding to allegations made by McBride against him he does not have to give answers we like
1595941612526395,1:05:41,makhosi nobhatyi,Mr just jumped into the pool coz his master was about to fall
1595941622017379,1:05:50,Mpotseng Lebentlele,@Kerry van Schalkwyk i agree hence its ok to put your argument across and still be respectful.
1595941631444931,1:06:01,Monique Jones,I'm confused. Is this an inquiry or a court proceeding? Has Nhleko been charged with a crime? Humor me please?
1595941646011601,1:06:15,Bophelo Malapela,Let’s watch and learn. The fire pool has no relevance here
1595941651369304,1:06:20,Wendy Greeff,No way can he defend this smoke and mirror decision he took at the time
1595941669634104,1:06:38,Gray Lawrence,yes. impersonating a minister
1595941818967013,1:09:08,Moonchild,"@Mpotseng Lebentlele - agreed & I was not being disrespectful, but if you view it like that, I apologise."
1595941991237220,1:12:00,Monique Jones,@Hubert Maphumulo that's called murder.
1595942013706808,1:12:22,Wendy Greeff,He executed directives from his boss and made reasons as he went along. They were not going to tolerate any resistance to their masterplan
1595942023589969,1:12:31,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Bophelo Malapela McBride won all those allegations, and Dramats as well question would be why he jumped into his decision , he may see that there was an evidence which was not favorable to politicn"

1595942139487697,1:14:30,Bophelo Malapela,"McBride came to the commission and alleged that this issue of reports and werksmans attorneys was State capture, this is what nhleko must respond to"
1595942177044977,1:15:06,Kevin Simon,All in can conclude at this point is that we deserve better public representatives than this guy. He hardly seems to have applied his mind to these matters while minister.
1595942203911688,1:15:33,Monique Jones,"Does he realize the diff between the truth and his version of the ""truth"""
1595942254343945,1:16:24,Kevin Davis,lol anc get taught from early to lue and deny and the president will do the rest
1595942257999950,1:16:26,Bophelo Malapela,Dramat and Sibiya lost their jobs because of this renditions nonsense. Sibiya last week won his case in labour court & wants his job back
1595942361488693,1:18:10,Wendy Greeff,He knows exactly what is truth and what not but he will never admit his part in the masterplan
1595942460817511,1:19:51,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Bophelo Malaphela you stated very well, it is when McBride saw there was problematic coz minister was trying to play politics to water all evidence which was after the masters then was to stop"

1595942656256470,1:23:05,MIKE DURBAN,My fear is that only the small fish will fry.........they will be the Fall Guys etc....
1595942673075356,1:23:21,Bophelo Malapela,"I am aware, he could not appear yesterday because of his new job as foreign director of SSA"
1595942676469352,1:23:25,Dominic Przybylski,It seems he plans to bore everybody to the point where they no longer ask him any more questions without the danger of dying of old age while in the same room.
1595942693384190,1:23:42,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Bophelo Malapela McBride will come as he promised but minister must tell truth coz they traumatizes people as we see poor evidence to all cases it’s because of this action by minister, they comproms"
1595942729584248,1:24:18,Wendy Greeff,The Commission will NOT get him to admit to anything. He will duck and dive to frustrate and tire them.
1595942821491513,1:25:51,Alvino Theunissen,Agree both @ Wendy @ Makhosi
1595942826999388,1:25:55,Monique Jones,So what were the renditions that this learned gentleman is speaking of
1595942903316246,1:27:12,Bophelo Malapela,Unlawful operations of allowing Zimbabwe police to kidnap Zimbabweans & take them to Zimbabwe where they were killed
1595942922549513,1:27:31,Venecia Moore,This is the same guy that said Mr Zuma need more money for Nkandla
1595942935210992,1:27:43,Sal SA,Rendition of 3 Zimbabweans back to law authorities in their country

1595942979924822,1:28:28,Monique Jones,"@Sal Abdulla were they ""illegal"" immigrants if I can use that term on the run?"
1595943018384909,1:29:07,Sal SA,Not sure Monique

1595943389159679,1:35:17,Dominic Przybylski,"Once majority of people rely on corruption to survive a corrupt government becomes essential to them, therefore will never be voted out unless there is a total collapse."
1595943436805701,1:36:06,Moonchild,"@Monique’s Makeup - that's a bit of a difficult one as no political party is perfect by any means. I think the best option would be a coalition of the DA, Cope, IFP & FF+."

1595946411433808,2:25:40,Kevin,From the President to the dustbin guy...they are all meant to be public servants. The sooner that is realized by the citizens of this country the better. They are accountable. We pay their salaries.

1595946574290515,2:28:24,Bophelo Malapela,@mpotseng lebentlele there is a reason why racists always hide their identity
1595946587316850,2:28:35,Dominic Przybylski,@Cerebis I suspect that day will only come once we have all died from starvation.

1595946825698625,2:32:34,Bophelo Malapela,Racist apologists need tranquilizer
1595946865112302,2:33:13,Moonchild,@Mpotseng Lebentlele - let's be clear - I said apartheid was a racist regime & very wrong. I then said 1994 was supposed to be the start of our new democracy without racism - that has not happened
1595946884798385,2:33:33,Bophelo Malapela,I will vote ANC everyday Soweto today is much better than the concentration camp it was under apartheid
1595946912426142,2:34:01,Mpotseng Lebentlele,@Kerry van Schalkwyk how have you contributed to equality in your work environment?
1595946912910189,2:34:02,Mangalani Mangalani,@Bophelo you are lying

1595947077118103,2:36:47,Bophelo Malapela,@postmaster racists are not progress nor civilization they are the lowest form of trash
1595947082552706,2:36:50,Dominic Przybylski,To identify people primarily by race can only be honestly done by people who identify themselves primarily by race. That is what a racist is. I feel sorry for them.
1595947085271480,2:36:52,Mpotseng Lebentlele,@Craig Johnson I would eat my hat if anyone admits
1595947096577841,2:37:05,Roy Kisten,no chance for Alli

1595947257799392,2:39:47,Dominic Przybylski,I travel by bicycle - carbon neutral.
1595947301190133,2:40:30,Bophelo Malapela,Prasa infrastructure has been stolen and we know the reasons for that
1595947317747487,2:40:47,Mpotseng Lebentlele,@Kerry van Schalkwyk I have a lot to you but maybe on a day when you are not looking for an audience and an applause like today.....
1595947319090909,2:40:48,Kevin,Personally speaking. The entire world needs a reboot. Nature needs to take over and do a clean sweep. This Covid is a warning. We need something like ebola to become airborn. Let the strong survive.
1595947348174966,2:41:16,Craig Johnson,"At what point do we stop blaming the past and start blaming the real criminals, the ANC"
1595947379103476,2:41:48,Bophelo Malapela,@kevin until you or a loved one dies of this virus
1595947397106103,2:42:06,Moonchild,"@Mpotseng Lebentlele - ha ha, you are projecting your own image onto me. I sleep with a very clear conscience knowing that I want us to ALL work together to uplift our country."
1595947403607548,2:42:13,Craig Johnson,Every person incriminated in this commision has a tie with the ANC. Say much???
1595947404760236,2:42:15,Mike du Preez,@Craig Johnson That will never happen. It's to comfortable. 🙂
1595947415336950,2:42:23,Anthony Ramasike,@Kevin..that is very..very..strong
1595947423593231,2:42:31,Bophelo Malapela,@craig Johnson when the victims of this crime say so until then deal with it
1595947424978021,2:42:33,Mangalani Mangalani,@Craig Johnson We stopped ages ago. Only ANC “cadres” are still stuck becaise they are benefiting

1595947563282430,2:44:53,Kevin,@Dominic Przybylski ....precisely. Us humans are destroying everything. Remember....humans are animals just as an ostrich is...Apparently we are only more intelligent.
1595947567518765,2:44:56,Moonchild,"@Pienaar van Wyk - and eating their pets & sand to survive! Look at Venezuela & the poverty & starvation in Zim, just to name two examples of failed states."
1595947569993941,2:44:58,Val Speirs,The Engineered Chinese Covert - 19 virus was designed to put the world on Pause and Reset the global economy. It was intentional and political. Only the fittest will survive.

1595947673688172,2:46:42,Moonchild,"@Singi Mathebula - that is my point, but now I'm labelled a racist as it's easier to play the race card than to deal with the facts of the ANC cadres & corruption."
1595947700182332,2:47:09,Bophelo Malapela,Apartheid and colonialism lasted over 400 yrs. ANC has also messed up in the 26 yrs never treat apartheid as an event
1595947703108841,2:47:11,Cedric John,"when all is said and done, will the findings of this com mission lead to prosecution?"
1595947719764163,2:47:29,Moonchild,@Craig Johnson - exactly. Divided by racist ANC politicians as well as the likes of the EFF.
1595947736888460,2:47:45,Val Speirs,It is amazing that apartheid has not been the blame for the Covid 19 virus:goodvibes:
1595947748189123,2:47:56,Singi Mathebula,ANC comrades continue to blame apartheid to cover their evil deeds😭😭
1595947751323000,2:48:00,William Pieters,This chat feels like a perfect cocoon for breeding incredible conspiracy theory's.
1595947775564226,2:48:25,Bophelo Malapela,@cedric John Ramaphosa signed a proclamation that seeks to achieve that hopefully people will start going to jail
1595947776826239,2:48:26,Craig Johnson,I hope that this crap 26 year legacy sits on everyone's minds the same way it has apartheid. This will be in the history books for our future generation to study.
1595947820375520,2:49:09,Bophelo Malapela,@val spiers do not be stupid
1595947855417989,2:49:44,Val Speirs,The Chinese engineered virus is not a conspiracy it is a fact.

1595947920173664,2:50:48,Singi Mathebula,"the corruption by ANC thugs has taken us back to over 300yrs of apartheid rule . the question is, was this so called democracy necessary 🤔"
1595947939184191,2:51:08,Bophelo Malapela,"@craig Johnson in the same way we will never forget and forgive apartheid, the waste of the past 26 yrs will not be forgotten, hence EFF is 3rd largest party"

1595947978474595,2:51:47,Moonchild,Just remember that other countries who were colonised have become extremely properous & economically wealthy eg Singapore. It took them far less than 26 years & no excuses. They just got on with it.
