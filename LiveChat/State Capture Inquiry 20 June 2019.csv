1561018592901433,1:36:32,sanele songelwa,looks like Meyni turned SAA in to a charity for the rich to be richer....
1561018636813317,1:37:16,Salmaan Abrahams,sad part is that it is at our expense ...the rich keeps taking from the poor
1561018697087741,1:38:16,sanele songelwa,"we continue to be poor, because of greedy local and foreign people.."
1561018748413057,1:39:08,Born free,Yes and also ministers of the ANC Luthuli house looting and diverting funds for the ANC campaigns R31 million to be exact.
1561018793476394,1:39:53,Moeneeb Martin,Theres no difference between local and foreign. There is just greedy and dishonest people. regardless of where they come.
1561018807782383,1:40:07,sanele songelwa,This is money that can create jobs and keep closing componies afloat..
1561018872863525,1:41:12,Isaac Mavuso,They worked us well. The current state of our country signals problems with the roots.
1561018884007712,1:41:24,Born free,It was money from the public purse meant to improve the lives of of the poor and keep State owned entities afloat.
1561018908031576,1:41:48,Wandile Magagula,Thats correct Moeneeb
1561018962222199,1:42:42,sanele songelwa,are they even going to be charged?
1561019012031731,1:43:31,Born free,Hopefully Judge Zondo will bring those recommendations when he concludes his report.
1561019057477703,1:44:17,makhosi nobhatyi,@Thando Nkutha is a fight between mkhwebane and Madonsela?
1561019094989585,1:44:55,sanele songelwa,"When is the big"" Shark"" being called in (Zuma)?"
1561019098703797,1:44:58,Wandile Magagula,The NPA will take over after the conclusion of the State Commission. Recommendations shall ahve been made by the D j Zondo.
1561019129679090,1:45:29,Ben Cole,People can be charged at any time. There is no obligation to wait for the final Zondo report.
1561019164565495,1:46:04,Thando Tomson,.....but that will be the NPA/Parliament's job to charge implicated people...?
1561019175170726,1:46:14,funicanz,"Morning, who is testifying?"
1561019177861097,1:46:17,sanele songelwa,NPA is going to let them pay half the money and let them go.. is that going to be fair?
1561019188097084,1:46:27,makhosi nobhatyi,"Zuma won’t come here as he refused to come and state his case,"
1561019207592804,1:46:48,Born free,Zuma has to pay R16million in legal expenses. Thank goodness he can no longer use taxpayers money to keep him from facing justice.
1561019214880461,1:46:55,Wandile Magagula,Theres a Unit the NPA announced I think last month they are going to do further investigation on some of the commission work that has been concluded.
1561019241662814,1:47:21,sanele songelwa,He is the cause of it all.
1561019255906067,1:47:36,funicanz,Zuma won't pay. He appeals almost everything.
1561019287534816,1:48:07,clive oconnell,Zuma can’t afford the bus fare he owes 16 million in lawyers fees.
1561019297567820,1:48:18,Ben Cole,Not parliament's job to decide who gets charged or not. Only NPA decides after either SAPS or Hawks investigation.
1561019313190808,1:48:32,Joyful Technologies,"whta if he doesn't pay,then WHAT?"
1561019319173469,1:48:39,sanele songelwa,because he does not have the taxpayers money in his pocket and his money is almost finished..
1561019326179944,1:48:45,Thando Tomson,the commission is the means to do damage control - as a result of what JZ did
