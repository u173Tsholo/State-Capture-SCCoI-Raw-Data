1584448437178088,30:10,Kevin Simon,Surely some people should be locked up for the level of corruption being revealed here? What have I missed?
1584448616576224,33:09,Paul Buchel,"@Concerned South African‚Äã, some will, definitely, but the cases will have to be heard in a criminalcourt."

1584448866257270,37:19,Peet Venter,This unfortunately happens when incompetent people are appointed to boards.
1584449254928662,43:47,Bev Daniels,"concerned south african, we will only see more arrests etc once the zondo is finished, he needs to make recommendations."
1584449275701108,44:10,Nande Sikenjana,When are we voting this ANC out of power people?
1584449368663586,45:41,Bev Daniels,HOPEFULLY before the five years are up as there was the general election last year 2019 and it is for five years

1584449622467790,49:56,Richard Mahope,New party will contain the people who captured the state
1584449627435587,50:00,Mbuso Ndlovu,"@Bev Daniels Mybe all the small parties should come together and form 1 party, mybe ANC will wake up"
1584449657404922,50:30,Nande Sikenjana,"Actually we need a party run by the youth with an age restriction, these old people dont have new ideas and dont care about the future of our nation"
1584449681115117,50:54,Bev Daniels,"@Mbuso that is not a bad idea but please not to involve the ]EFF, as they really cannot behave it is disgusting to be like that, not an example to the youth to have no respect for anything."

1584450171025856,59:04,Bev Daniels,@Nande that is why all and sundry are asking for the DEATH SENTENCE to be brought in
1584450269899176,1:00:43,Nande Sikenjana,Richard you would be surprised as to how many big players from outside the world who would benefit from the chaos will jump at the opportunity to fund war

1584453090384346,1:47:43,Steve Roos,China is the definition of dodgey
1584453127897591,1:48:20,Keith Din,"Yeah mate @Steve Roos LOL. I am proud of you, too. Come back but only after the corona has subsided"
1584453158081586,1:48:50,Nande Sikenjana,Bru the Chinese government is the epitome of dodgy
1584453159741913,1:48:52,Steve Roos,I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they didn‚Äôt engineer this virus
1584453171014183,1:49:04,Mahnaym Jyeff,howzit guys

1584453308455216,1:51:21,Nande Sikenjana,"Oh the virus is going to infect everyone in our country including you reading this, the question is are you going to survive it or not."
1584453363187487,1:52:15,Keith Din,"Talking about engineered this virus. Who knows @Steve Roos ? ... jeez, i was suspicious here my brother, but in another corona infested country. Please be safe with kids."
1584453367055175,1:52:19,Nomonde Gubevu,@Keith Start in Kilptown. Our government should have never waited this long to start taking control of the corona virus. They knew about this months ago
1584453414363900,1:53:06,Nomonde Gubevu,@Keith We do not have enough testing station so there's no way of really determining how many people have actually already been in contact with the virus without even knowing.
