1555072382174195,28:56,Desmond Masilela,I'm not sure if is the camera or the adv lady next to Mr Pretorius. Here face is totally different than her neck. But let me sit down and eat my humble pie.
1555072401264788,29:16,Magda Seguin,I understood exactly about how he explained about the reports....but Mr Pretorious does not...bathung
1555072525485487,31:20,Magda Seguin,8 minutes....report explanatio not yet resolved
1555072536562038,31:30,Fabian Davids,Ewallet🤣
1555072557019711,31:51,Brandaan Huigen,Lol really going into detail here
1555072566441443,32:01,Madelein R,The people in our building works with Bitcoin. They say that it will go up and peak in June. Please do not see this as financial advise
1555072587994360,32:22,Eslon Eslon,Goodness!! the makeup on the young advocate lady next to Pretorius is pathetic
1555072640259637,33:15,Desmond Masilela,@Eslon Eslon. 🤦🤦🤦
1555072644506547,33:19,Magda Seguin,Eslon is it not the lighting in the room?
1555072645225412,33:20,lucky Molepo,we dont care abt make uo
1555072645316618,33:20,Derek Main,@Madelein Huxtable They have a vested interest in saying that if they own bitcoins. They want more people to invest in them so the value will go up. Feels like a pyramid scheme.
1555072674568227,33:49,what?,"buy bitcoin, it's the right thing to do 😉"
1555072680323518,33:54,Felix Muyoba,@Derek Main you are right
1555072692140918,34:07,The Vuka Experience,Is he dropping bombs or ?

1555072775767911,35:29,Eslon Eslon,"Magda Seguin, No its not about lighting the make-up is literally too much"
1555072800469139,35:55,Magda Seguin,Eslon give her a break😂
1555073030943798,39:44,Madelein R,@Derek Main - dont have money to buy it anyways
1555073088075047,40:42,Madelein R,Eslon - it might be the light that makes it look bad
1555073112385912,41:07,Derek Main,"@Madelein Huxtable In that case, you have just saved yourself some money 😃"
1555073141632253,41:36,Madelein R,@Derek Main - thank you
1555073143925788,41:38,Desmond Masilela,I was expecting some big bombs by this time. Nothing as yet. Who are the 30 officially top ANC members that media has spoken about?
1555073170914551,42:06,Magda Seguin,I will really miss you all when the commission ends
1555073278113488,43:52,Madelein R,@Desmond Masilela - I also thought so. But may be they are buying time for the notifications (2 day Notice when naming someone)
1555073294089895,44:08,Ariel Heaven,"Where can one find a Louie Vuitton handbag that was a left over, with the money!!!!"
1555073347976405,45:02,Madelein R,I also want a Louie Vuitton bag. 50K will be fine for now 😀😀😀
1555073491005713,47:25,Desmond Masilela,@Madelein Huxtable. I'm just confuse really. Mr Mcbride is here just to nail his former employer.
1555073546352525,48:20,Magda Seguin,Making a 'genuine errors TWICE...Haribo Judge
1555073559384193,48:34,Magda Seguin,*haibo
1555073579864471,48:54,GH MG,bla bla bla bla bla
1555073633406399,49:48,Eslon Eslon,"@Desmond Masilela, Mcbride is not here to nail his former employer but to provide the truth to the commission"
1555073663544836,50:18,Antonie Goosen,also can't see the relevance or how any reliance could be placed on the testimony of a drunk and a murderer
1555073689774143,50:44,Desmond Masilela,@Eslon Eslon. We were told his going to dish some bombs and nothing till now.
1555073711786945,51:06,AYE!! its yaddy,viva anc viva
1555073711908127,51:06,Magda Seguin,They are really giving Mc Bride a hard time...what exactly is at play here? It's the first time a witness is so minutely questioned
1555073824901432,52:59,Eslon Eslon,"Give him time, there's alot of interjection from evidence leader and the chair"
1555073837025234,53:11,Blue moon Spring,I am asking that same question Magda😉
1555073837042429,53:11,Jane .Blamire,Magda. Maybe something big coming?? Being thorough for a reason??
1555073899550161,54:14,Desmond Masilela,@Eslon Eslon. But I understand why he has pull any plug yet. Is because of the Adv when he always say will talk about that in due course.
1555073951494888,55:06,Jane .Blamire,Agree Desmond.....name dropping to come soon
1555073967156456,55:22,Magda Seguin,Thanks all...there may be serious stuff coming..I read in Amaghubane that there is a story of the alleged illegal surveillance by State Security of the Nasrec ANC conference which was thwarted
1555073991168257,55:45,Nelson Musoliwa,Some imagined versions detonating bombs that sparks with wine in the bottle nooo guys version bombs ere not necessarily explosive or dramatic
1555074029954101,56:24,Jane .Blamire,Huh?
1555074038196810,56:33,Desmond Masilela,@Jane .Blamire. Mr Mcbride will be here for 2 days according to the chair. His now on a second day maybe he might finish next Monday. So at this time not Bomb shell has been pulled.
1555074043058410,56:37,Luzuko Ngetu,what a big voice
1555074048216089,56:42,Eslon Eslon,Jane. Blamire... Remember this guy will disturb Zondo's conscious bcoz he will implicate his younger brother
1555074063399155,56:58,Talent P Sibisi,Zuma again for Gaddaffi money he he he
1555074069704666,57:04,Magda Seguin,Imagined versions? Really?
1555074098806271,57:33,Luzuko Ngetu,zuma is the legend
1555074118922569,57:53,Magda Seguin,The Judge is digging deep
1555074124440642,57:59,Antonie Goosen,@ Nelson Musoliwa -McBride may take it literally and kill more innocent people
1555074138550374,58:13,Magda Seguin,McBride is unphased
1555074207716333,59:22,Eslon Eslon,Zondo will want to use every opportunity to confuse Mcbride for his younger brother's sake
1555074254810297,1:00:10,Magda Seguin,Eslon Family and friends liaisons run deep in state capture
1555074417259858,1:02:51,Aniceth De Missamou,"@TalentSibisi, Zuma is scared of Gaddafifi son. now he's claming is life is danger. he must just give the money back nd he won't be a target of that boy."
1555074434115873,1:03:08,Nelson Musoliwa,@Eslon u raise a very important issue involving conflict of interest on Zondo's part but he is regarded in high esteem the legal team shows competitiveness so fr
1555074458488709,1:03:33,Michael Michael,Elson mr Zondo is a fair person

1555074492945023,1:04:07,Fils de l'homme,gud afternoon to all my coolies n hottentots
1555074588094355,1:05:42,Magda Seguin,Most of this sounds like cross examination not leading evidence

1555074689562809,1:07:24,Cerebis,@Fils de l'homme You are a race baiter and a stupid person. Wow....
1555074710422037,1:07:45,James Godloza Godloza,I like the way SC Pretorius is leading/cross examining the witness
1555074748939064,1:08:23,Magda Seguin,Do you know the difference? it's not about liking but facts
1555074761670828,1:08:36,Michael Michael,Corbis he is more than that.the gd thing is not to entertain him.

1555074908720721,1:11:03,James Godloza Godloza,"look at it this way my sister, will cross examining the witness not help the commission and the witness to eliminate any application to cross examine if the witnesses testimony is factually tested"
1555074911793585,1:11:06,Fils de l'homme,@Madelein Huxtable u hav no right to violate my freedom to speak
1555074936441075,1:11:30,Cerebis,@Fils de l'homme It must be your turn to use the family brain cell today? Use it wisely dude!
1555074941179741,1:11:35,Jane .Blamire,"Quote...He [McBride] will testify to a range of matters and a range of disciplinary hearings, as well as inquiries. One of those inquiries was chaired by Mxolisi Zondo, the chairman’s younger brother."
1555074949750328,1:11:44,Eslon Eslon,"@Michael Michael, He maybe be fair but how sure are you that he will be impartial in examining evidence in which his younger brother is implicated?"
1555074979875244,1:12:14,Dominic Przybylski,For a moment I saw the garbage from fils de l'homme and then I realised I wasn't logged in. Now he has disappeared. Best block I ever did.
1555074995692334,1:12:29,Magda Seguin,I understand that but why do they change tactic with this witness and only did it a few times in between the testimony of others
1555074999454319,1:12:33,James Godloza Godloza,just thinking or drawing my own opinion but as I'm not a law expert but only trying to understand the working of the law
1555075037437914,1:13:11,Madelein R,@Fils de l'homme - it is not freedom of speech. TRANSVAAL belongs pre-94. Move on buddy
1555075050265495,1:13:24,Magda Seguin,My thinking is they are walking on eggshells here as so many state security people were involved
1555075053920740,1:13:28,Khaya Nomoyi,This is becoming so boring now.
1555075094150760,1:14:08,Desmond Masilela,@Khaya Nomoyi. Eishhh..... you right
1555075129503819,1:14:43,Madelein R,@Khaya Nomoyi and @Desmond Masilela - agree
1555075143732688,1:14:58,Magda Seguin,I reported Geldenhuys...harassment and bullying...this is not a platform to spew put hatred
1555075182922733,1:15:37,James Godloza Godloza,I think with the fact that when they started with this witness the was this cloud of conflict as the DCJ brother being implicated
1555075216624161,1:16:11,Desmond Masilela,@Madelein Huxtable @Khaya Nomoyi. This team of Mr Pretorius is boring. I think I will only watch the team of Adv Maleka. This one is just wasting my data.
1555075237709940,1:16:32,Magda Seguin,True @James
1555075345132813,1:18:19,Anne M.,"@Desmond Masilela I am not sure the DCJ's brother is implicated as such. From what I understand (yesterday morning), it is an opinion on his conclusion. The brother sent the report to the commission."
1555075383188644,1:18:58,James Godloza Godloza,@Jane I think the DCJ has proven beyond doubt that he is the man for this job
1555075390116368,1:19:04,Magda Seguin,No his brother chaired McBride's disciplinary
1555075402339507,1:19:17,Khaya Nomoyi,Masilela you are right.What is the problem with differentiating these reports and move on?
1555075461673801,1:20:16,James Godloza Godloza,but i still believe the submissions made by the panel will be applicable at the end
1555075463640373,1:20:18,frederick Mashavhela,guys wait for Mr Mcbride he is a credible man he will soon drop those bombs
1555075497630431,1:20:52,Desmond Masilela,@Khaya Nomoyi. Remember the other team is investigating Bosasa the other Guptas. So The Adv Maleka team is investigating Gupta I think some other issues as well.
1555075522432689,1:21:17,James Godloza Godloza,@Anne that is correct
1555075527321694,1:21:21,Magda Seguin,He is steadfast @frederick we need to be patient
1555075589481463,1:22:24,frederick Mashavhela,exactly Mr pretorius will soon find a way with Mr Mcbride
1555075606213842,1:22:40,Quintin Jacobs,still no smoking gun ie JZ is corrupt??
1555075611614776,1:22:46,Eslon Eslon,"@Magda Seguin, and Mcbride was an escape goat at that hearing, bcoz he took the matter to court and won the case"
1555075644541688,1:23:19,Magda Seguin,Exactly @Eslon
1555075647850688,1:23:22,Khaya Nomoyi,"OK,Masilela I understand."
1555075654630440,1:23:29,Quintin Jacobs,cde McBride using StateCapCom to settle scores well done to him
1555075671057614,1:23:45,Desmond Masilela,@Khaya Nomoyi. Thank you.
1555075792117135,1:25:46,Eslon Eslon,"@Magda Seguin, Meaning Zondo jr presided the hearing that was set up to victimize Mcbride bcoz there was no basis to discipline him in the first place"
