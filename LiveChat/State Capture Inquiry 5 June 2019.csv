1559723426081962,21:08,Ernest Eniboy,"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."
1559723489953661,22:11,makhosi nobhatyi,"Pretorious get frightened by the noise outside, I don‚Äôt know why people would protest outside"

1559723839048409,28:01,makhosi nobhatyi,As Gordhan says those who are corrupt they are not just sitting there doing nothing they organize to fight back. He said that back 2016 we have seen this happening recently I am not surprised
1559723874935594,28:36,William Pieters,Nedbank is going down aswell.
1559724005613878,30:07,Ernest Eniboy,Power attracts the corruptible. Suspect any who seek it.
1559724026882407,30:28,SBH Shembe,I wonder when the human race will wake finally wake up.. I mean really wake up
1559724159599573,32:40,Ernest Eniboy,"You know, it's pretty easy to watch this state capture to see why I was angry and confused for all those years. I lived my life being told different stories: some true, some lies"
1559724244595583,34:05,Ernest Eniboy,To oppose corruption in government is the highest obligation of patriotism.
1559724351524262,35:53,William Pieters,Very well said @Ernest Eniboy
1559724403615377,36:44,Ernest Eniboy,True indeed Mr pieterse
1559724511941909,38:33,Kevin Simon,"""To oppose corruption in government is the highest obligation of patriotism"" quote by G. Edward Griffin"
1559724564658182,39:25,Slindile Ngcobo,@Ernest Eniboy ....eishhhh
1559724669681159,41:10,Ernest Eniboy,"Come forward as servants in this state capture organize the people economically, socially, educationally and politically and I am sure that you will be a power that will be accepted by everybody"
1559724815305751,43:36,Ted Michel,Where is all the background singing coming from ?
1559724833455829,43:55,Ernest Eniboy,Listen to this guy
1559724900946847,45:02,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Yes - you only had to listen to Ace yesterday to see who is leading that charge.
1559725130079523,48:51,makhosi nobhatyi,"Derek Main hey the old man is not reporting correctly, surely you heard Enoch Godongwana responding on the matter of expanding reserved bank saying that part was not being discussed and taken decision"
1559725184562748,49:45,Kevin Simon,"‚ÄúCome forward as servants of Islam, organize the people economically, socially, educationally and politically and I am sure that ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..y.‚Äù Muhammad Ali Jinnah"
1559725225887597,50:27,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi He was clearly drunk and was doing his usual waffling. He didn't answer questions asked and eventually walked off without answering all questions. Total arrogance.
1559725239011722,50:40,Naledzani Mashau,Ace was just blabbing (the whole party has no idea where to start with the land issue ).How can we trust them?
1559725263522145,51:05,SBH Shembe,@Naledzani Mashau don't trust any politician..
1559725281082812,51:22,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi He actually asked for the scraping of the tender system. I'm not sure why he would want that - Mr Ten Percent has made a lot of money from tenders.
1559725322312432,52:04,makhosi nobhatyi,"Reserve bank issue statement to the minister of finance which he rubbishy all of that, I think Ace Magashule is old, must put young blood there, we will have huge problems when someone reports wrong"
1559725326521110,52:08,Derek Main,Yep - NEVER trust a politician.
1559725327502498,52:09,Naledzani Mashau,You can trust them at your own peril
1559725365817953,52:47,SBH Shembe,yup .. just make sure you are in a space where you can deal with disappointments
1559725522048627,55:23,Ernest Eniboy,@ Derek Main the most dangerous people in the world are politicians
1559725556962016,55:58,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Naledzani Mashau the party knows where to start but problem is, faction is killing the party, so there are those whom seems they are the champion of that project Zuma faction it stacked there"
1559725633594910,57:14,Zee Zondani,"just here to listen to Derek, more than the testimonies... I knew I would find him hereüòÇ"
1559725681561150,58:02,Derek Main,@Ernest Eniboy Tell me about it - politicians are more trouble than they are worth (and expensive). We should get rid of them.
1559725731365775,58:52,makhosi nobhatyi,"Ramaphosa patience will come to unend coz when they continue doing so they are delaying government to do its own job so that they can count on him as a failure, using strategy to unseat him"
1559725738963830,59:00,Cassius Mngomezulu,Black people are not corrupt but corrubtable
1559725744146236,59:05,Derek Main,@Zikhona Zondani I'm flattered. The cheque is in the mail.
1559725771059880,59:32,Derek Main,@Cassius Mngomezulu I don't understand the difference - please explain.
1559725811523913,1:00:13,Cassius Mngomezulu,R50- per lesson n nothing 4 mahala
1559725820183926,1:00:21,Ernest Eniboy,True indeed @ Derek main
1559725821417817,1:00:23,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi We citizens should be unseating Ramaphosa if he doesn't deliver on his promises.
1559725841006173,1:00:42,Sebastian Gudu,I hope these commissions r not a waste of time we want to see heads rolling
1559725892397327,1:01:34,makhosi nobhatyi,I think Ace Magashule was not supposed to report about SARB matter because it not yet been finalized
1559725895814564,1:01:38,Sebastian Gudu,when is npa stepping in
1559725896273628,1:01:38,Derek Main,"@Cassius Mngomezulu ""Black people are not corrupt"" PULEEZ"
1559725966708814,1:02:48,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi So you think that Ace talking about SARB was the worst thing about his performance last night?
1559725991717556,1:03:12,Ernest Eniboy,"Government's first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives after this state capture I want to see a better government"
1559726031285662,1:03:52,makhosi nobhatyi,@Derek main I got you brother but faction of are in the hurry as you heard Masina and Tony Yengeni publicly criticize president for appointing Gordhan they feel threatened
1559726067889940,1:04:29,Dams daily motivations Madamalala,Official are Easy to Corrupt e.g you are a traffic officer you earn R27 000 a month your in charge of contractors management & your facilitating R20million tender easy u get R200 000 you ofer Contract
1559726094413136,1:04:55,Dams daily motivations Madamalala,never trust a Human being
1559726106139210,1:05:07,clive oconnell,The corrupted have their hands out all the time waiting for golden crumbs off the main table
1559726198565134,1:06:40,Singi Mathebula,Ace is worst that any other SG ever elected . what happened at Nasrec mara!?
1559726224333891,1:07:05,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main no I am not suggesting that he was a worst thing all I am trying to say he is lacking experience he should report outcomes, finalized issues not the one land and sarb matter"
1559726436669412,1:10:37,Zee Zondani,@Singi Mathebula so true
1559726484442637,1:11:25,Zee Zondani,"I dont understand how the anc chooses its people, like honestly I dont know, look at their chief whip.she is an absolute disaster if you ask me"
1559726513777961,1:11:55,Derek Main,I don't know how people vote for the ANC. Corrupt to the core.
1559726718416079,1:15:19,Benjamin Sigcu,Welcome to the party of Mandela
1559726761289789,1:16:02,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Zikhona Zondani ANC chief whip she is a hard work, she comes from provincial so I think let us give her a chance. President Ramaphosa was very clever by removing NDZ by his office and put trust one"
1559727136466191,1:22:17,Naledzani Mashau,"Ernest, my brother I'm 100 percent behind you and they must do what people want and stop talking about the party at government level or events."
1559727272130063,1:24:33,jett888,@zikhona zondani usually whoever is willing to be a puppet or sell their soul to the hugest bidder to do their dirty deeds for the puppeteer gets the position ‚ù§Ô∏è but that‚Äôs just my opinion
1559728097522787,1:38:18,Erastus Adolf,...but why is it that every other white folk coming to testify at the commision has to be interrogated by adv.Pritorious??..Why is it that way???
1559728164770016,1:39:26,Cerebis,@Erastus Adolf Huh???
1559728190241190,1:39:51,Mbongeni Mapipa,"wrong, the previous witness was white and was led by African advocate"
1559728245614649,1:40:46,Cerebis,Exactly Mbongeni! Another race baiter in the house?
1559728289163080,1:41:30,Erastus Adolf,is Rajesh white?
1559728316018095,1:41:57,Cerebis,Adolf blocked
1559728336413005,1:42:18,Peet Venter,The wittness' expertise is matched by the evidence leader.
1559728396285207,1:43:17,Tee Makara,‚ÄúSexy girl‚Äù are so annoying

1559728543644722,1:45:45,Anne M.,@Tee Makara üòÄ
1559728583461900,1:46:25,Frik Brits,"@Tee Makara , I do not think they are moderators they just are the stream owners"
1559728639313085,1:47:20,Mbongeni Mapipa,thanks for removing this annoying thing üëç
1559728664469311,1:47:45,Tee Makara,@Frik Brits they annoying period
1559728729710421,1:48:50,Cerebis,Proteas 2 for 24 runs! Here we go again??
1559728782734201,1:49:44,Anne M.,@Cerebis s - Oh no! The chokers reputation continues
1559728835832812,1:50:37,makhosi nobhatyi,"Enoch Godwangana is not happy at all by the matter of SARB saying wat was read by SG was not accepted resolution of naserec says SARB should be remain private, no interference"
1559728836441660,1:50:37,Anne M.,@Tebogo Lenyora Who are they playing?
1559728845722668,1:50:47,Cerebis,@Anne M. Yes....So sad....and frustrating!!
1559728876250728,1:51:17,PETER STAFFEN,Cerebis dont be mean they are an excellent side
1559728954709580,1:52:36,Cerebis,"@makhosi nobhatyi Yes, some ANC members are making sense! Maybe they should not call it a Bank...some people think of huge vaults full of money and gold???...lol"
1559728979789127,1:53:01,Anne M.,@Tebogo Lenyora Doesn't Afcon have pool stages?
1559729006494001,1:53:27,Cerebis,@Peter Staffen You are right! I think that the Proteas is a weak team
1559729044263004,1:54:06,Mbongeni Mapipa,proteas are playing India
1559729057682438,1:54:18,Kevin Simon,Didn't Zwane also make a statement re engaging the banks on the Gupta accounts and claim it was a Cabinet Resolution?
1559729245641482,1:57:26,makhosi nobhatyi,@Cerebis Ace Magashule is reading post naserec NDZ campaign not resolution of the conference. Conference was very clear about reserve bank that remained private so we can create jobs
1559729268591744,1:57:49,motivation world,hello
1559729306673561,1:58:28,Derek Main,We don't know who in the ANC to listen to anymore. Contradictory messages.
1559729489691925,2:01:30,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÉüòÉüòÄ no you need to understand old man is fighting back using Anc position to sabotage Ramaphosa leadership doing purposely, we are waiting patiently for him here he must account"
1559729495330828,2:01:36,SBH Shembe,leaving this soap opera .. Days of our lives
1559729516485693,2:01:57,makhosi nobhatyi,Ramaphosa stance in fighting corruption hasn‚Äôt changed
1559729535995606,2:02:16,Cerebis,@makhosi nobhatyi 100% correct! ANC must start speaking in one voice! CR must introduce a system of only nominated person allowed to make public comments?
1559729602066838,2:03:24,Peet Venter,Transnet should have adopted the same approach in March if they learnt anything of the Desember swop.
1559729626049796,2:03:47,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi But Ace is who the ANC members elected! Why do you expect any different? It's almost the same as ANC voters believing that the thieves in government will tackle corruption.
1559729639284996,2:04:00,Peet Venter,"Yet they repeated the same ""mistake"". Fishy"
1559729731112025,2:05:32,makhosi nobhatyi,@Cerebis üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÄüòÄüòÄ CR have huge problem here Ace Magashule is messing everything when Q&A happens lol faction live inside him lol
1559729804793758,2:06:46,Arjun Kumar,hai
1559729854004508,2:07:35,Cerebis,@Tebogo Lenyora Mayor of JHB is a DA member
1559729895447760,2:08:16,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Derek main yes those people should listen to Mbalula back in 2015 when he says electing Ace the party will go down, he suggested the name of David Makura, this is a result now we see"
1559729915377511,2:08:36,Kevin Simon,"Perhaps Ace knows his number is up and trying to sow misinformation as much as he can, while he can. See Zuma's free education pre Nasrec 2017."
1559729980980234,2:09:42,Pat Smith,This black guy has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about
1559730083707748,2:11:25,makhosi nobhatyi,@kevin Allister Simon indeed it is number coming weeks Guptas whistle blowers will take stand and email will be show as reflection so he is trying to get supporters but he is weak no power
1559730217317226,2:13:38,makhosi nobhatyi,"I hope before he can address media, they must train him how to deliver msg not leave everything to him, drafts media statements I think that would be better"
1559730256760300,2:14:18,Cerebis,"@Tebogo Lenyora Fine I agree, but so far, I do not think the DA has any cadres? But sure to come as the Da is ANC Lite after all?....lol"
1559730286252636,2:14:47,Thami Ngwenya,The man cant deal with media
1559730591926490,2:19:53,makhosi nobhatyi,"ANC is for all people, but you need to be firmly on policy once conference took decision not Lekgotla nor NEC should change that"
1559730643056718,2:20:44,kevindbn007,We just need honest ppl in government and this country will flourish
1559730674936851,2:21:15,kevindbn007,"Come on ANC, get the corrupt out"
1559730690278787,2:21:31,Kapn Krunch,you think we are going to see job losses from government that's a measly affect the main reason we are going to see huge job losses is people are leaving markets are clenching cell c are losing client
1559730698527284,2:21:40,Kapn Krunch,like everyone else
1559730720359135,2:22:01,Surinderjit Singh Rana,gupta family from india by covert support from gov india behind State capture South Africa
1559730762701357,2:22:44,Cerebis,"@kevindbn007 Yes, but too many unsuitable people slipped thru the Ace hole into parliament and the cabinet."
1559730774028689,2:22:55,Kapn Krunch,we got some hard times ahead skilled workers are leaving
1559730817217382,2:23:38,kevindbn007,"So we are hearing testimony from all these ppl, when will the NPA / Law act"
1559730865354565,2:24:26,Zee Zondani,"Ace should be premier of free state, he is better off there. everytime he opens his mouth, wrong statements are made"
1559730872362883,2:24:33,kevindbn007,"as i understand it, this commission has NO power to arrest, indite accused individuals"
1559730873380866,2:24:34,Cerebis,"@Kapn Krunch It is very true! In my immediate family and friends circle, 21 people have emigrated in the past 2 years!"
1559730919187809,2:25:20,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Kevindbn007 it is a process that will happen need time as we go along, we will find one another remove corrupt people what I can say now they are making too many noise to confuse citizens in defense"
1559730944222338,2:25:45,Kapn Krunch,myself my parents my brother and one side of my grandparents are the only ones still here of a family of about 30 so yeah I'm the same
1559730964915958,2:26:05,kevindbn007,But all these weeks and nothing has come of it
1559730965984114,2:26:06,Cerebis,@Zikhona Zondani Maybe he should be in jail? He was a disaster in the Free State....period!
1559730972041173,2:26:13,makhosi nobhatyi,@Zikhona Zondani you notice what I have seen üòÉüòÉüòÉ
1559730972669177,2:26:14,Kapn Krunch,carteblanche did an episode on the numbers that are leaving at the moment
1559731006268252,2:26:47,kevindbn007,"that ANN7 guy revealed some damning testominy about ""certain"" high profile ANC people"
1559731051329121,2:27:32,Peet Venter,SABC digital news please show the slides!!!!
1559731075206099,2:27:56,Kapn Krunch,doesn't bode well for the future of our country
1559731087634030,2:28:08,kevindbn007,"JZ being involved in the running of the station is worrying, thats propaganda"
1559731112262941,2:28:33,Kapn Krunch,for every one skilled worker we lose 3 families have less money for food as we are a welfare state
1559731163610347,2:29:25,makhosi nobhatyi,@Kevindbn007 that is what we need those who did wrong must be exposed and acount here and be arrested that was a resolution we took at Naserec
1559731228726054,2:30:29,Cerebis,That is a huge problem as the people leaving are crucial to job creation. Government does not create jobs in spite of the political rhetoric
1559731283137243,2:31:23,Kapn Krunch,yes our skilled workers are also our consumers less consumers mean companies down size which results in less jobs
1559731326458391,2:32:07,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi My point is that we can't depend on the ANC voters to vote for the betterment of SA. They don't think that far ahead.
1559731330841075,2:32:11,Cerebis,Agree! Just look at the latest numbers from the JSE companies.....mostly down
1559731357313180,2:32:38,Zee Zondani,This derek fella is obsessed with the anc
1559731368259059,2:32:49,Derek Main,Trump is a chump.
1559731385720980,2:33:07,Zee Zondani,everything he says has the anc embedded in it
1559731442350689,2:34:03,Derek Main,@Zikhona Zondani Only because their decisions and criminality affect me. I wouldn't mind if they died altogether so I wouldn't have to worry about their negative effect on SA.
1559731458284486,2:34:20,Cerebis,"Latest GDP numbers is a disaster! And the Unions, partner to the ANC government, says the Government must pull out their finger....Funny"
1559731539527812,2:35:40,Zee Zondani,"people are not risk takers, the majority of sa voters are not risk takers. removing the anc out of power will take another 100 years sadly for some fellas"
1559731575119592,2:36:15,makhosi nobhatyi,If anc deploys me as a minister I should do my job honestly and transparency no shenanigans once I have found I did wrong party mustn‚Äôt defend me fire me to save image of the organization
1559731657807195,2:37:39,Zee Zondani,I just want to take ace's position üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1559731676358407,2:37:57,Kapn Krunch,the ancs rhetoric in parliament their blatant lies their blame shifting their announcements of radical policies without the plan on how they are going to enact those policies have led directly to this
1559731701856982,2:38:22,Derek Main,@Zikhona Zondani Then we can expect more of the same for the next 100 years. Criminality and plunder.
1559731735157603,2:38:56,Kapn Krunch,their moves to stay in power first gave investors cold feet now its given our very people could feet
1559731887188569,2:41:28,Cerebis,"I block so many of these rubbish adds, I accidentally blocked a moderator the other day....lol"
1559732079466113,2:44:40,adrian albertyn,cant the adds be stopped.
