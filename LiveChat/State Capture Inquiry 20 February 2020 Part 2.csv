1582202068286746,32:30,Mbuso Ndlovu,Zondo will be rich at the end of this nonsense commission😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
1582202125076919,33:27,Anne M.,That's if he is paid anything extra. He might only be paid his normal salary.
1582202167999212,34:09,Vuyisani Sikobi,"Zondo is not paid a cent, its only the commission staff that earn a salary, he only earns his DCJ salary"
1582202179822327,34:23,Mbuso Ndlovu,What about all these lawyers and evidence leaders??
1582202217595110,35:01,Mbuso Ndlovu,Zondo is charging per Hour😀😁😂
1582202245474684,35:27,Mbuso Ndlovu,That's why he likes to ajourn

1582202447118783,38:49,Mbuso Ndlovu,We need to investigate Judges also!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1582202482144051,39:25,Mbuso Ndlovu,are we scared????????????
1582202564397258,40:47,Mbuso Ndlovu,White judges are always sentence blacks even when there is a little evidence. We need to get to the bottom of this.
1582202762320345,44:02,MIKE DURBAN,@Mbuso Ndlovu ....STOP playing the Race card Bra....you naughty boy........
1582202787471569,44:30,Mbuso Ndlovu,Der Clerk must come before Zondo to explain Apartheid
1582202850009859,45:32,MIKE DURBAN,@Mbuso Ndlovu ...You about 30yrs behind Bra......just like the ANC/EFF.......
1582202961081873,47:23,MIKE DURBAN,The saying goes...Bra's........You can't live in the past.....you can only live going forward.....true ne...
1582202963531474,47:26,D Thomas,@Anne M we are now on the issue of qualified reports you mentioned earlier
1582203071319119,49:13,Anne M.,"@D Thomas Yes, and I don't know if his explanation is 100 accurate."
1582203086784015,49:29,Chosen One,Why is that abantu abamnyama are always implicated.
1582203088188129,49:30,Anne M.,* 100%
1582203162695373,50:44,Anne M.,@Chosen One What about PWC and Deloittes?
1582203176571894,50:58,Rusty SpyGoat,@Mike Durban it is the leadership of the political parties i.e EFF that have set a precedent of being racist in the public. And unfortunately people take that to mean that they too can be racist
1582203216797355,51:38,MIKE DURBAN,@Rusty SpyGoat ....spot on....
1582203280101421,52:40,D Thomas,@Anne M I mean they deal with the qualified reports

1582203504262042,56:25,Chosen One,@MIKE DURBAN we will have a situation in which people are attracted to gov posts for corruption purposes.
1582203536173708,56:57,Chosen One,We should have qualified and ethical people running gov.
1582203554118064,57:17,D Thomas,"@Anne M, do not seem to understand his explanation. An unqualified report with material errors should be professional negligence, I would imagine"
1582203563307085,57:25,MIKE DURBAN,@Stronger together ......would not be surprised.....he is not a stable person........there is something funny about him......
1582203601249592,58:02,Anne M.,@D Thomas And even DCJ is a bit confused by his statement.
1582203613577993,58:13,Redsbaron1,seeking attention
1582203629124751,58:30,anya van loggerenberg,Maybe Malema is on drugs

1582203652101989,58:53,D Thomas,"@Anne M, I think so too"
1582203674744661,59:18,MIKE DURBAN,Ya...something evil about him..........coo coo maybe.....

1582204040308403,1:05:21,D Thomas,"Anne M, I am not sure I understand this but is the AG not accountable to Parliament?"
1582204071789289,1:05:55,Anne M.,"@D Thomas Yes, he is"
1582204109344037,1:06:31,Anne M.,That's why he gives an annual report (bemoaning) the high number of qualified audit reports and the numbers don't seem to be coming down.
1582204134684292,1:06:56,Immanuel,@Anne M are you shy?
1582204164798047,1:07:27,D Thomas,"@Anne M, I see. Thanks"

1582204295541369,1:09:37,Immanuel,"@Anne M I notice that you always cover your eyes on a daily basis,so i though maybe you are very shy🤣🤣🤣"
1582204591560735,1:14:34,Anne M.,"@Immanuel My profile photo is actually an old meme of a child talking on a phone saying ""No Grandma, listen. Double click the Internet Explorer button""."

1582205549176542,1:30:32,Earth 420,Necrophonic App... Talk to Ghosts
1582205566283643,1:30:48,D Thomas,"@Anne M, would it be unreasonable to conclude that the audit and assurance of SAA was significantly below acceptable standards ?"
1582205729551834,1:33:30,D Thomas,"@Anne M, I also observed this man has merely glossed over the issue of going concern"
1582205738286159,1:33:40,DyceDobson,"14,000 hours!"
1582205839973364,1:35:22,Lissa Aires,Hey
1582205859028168,1:35:42,Bernard Matolino,What happened to #Magda I challenged her on one issue and she blocked me. Havent heard about her in a long time
1582205873867585,1:35:56,Anne M.,@D Thomas I don't think it's unreasonable. I'm a bit puzzled why they appear to be tip toeing around some of the issues.\
1582205908992548,1:36:30,FieliesSA,@Mvuyi Mpithi From the Zuma foundation
1582205924034332,1:36:46,Anne M.,@Lex Luger I was wondering the same thing last week. I haven't seen her name for quite a while.
1582206071020649,1:39:12,Bernard Matolino,"@Anne M. She is missed. Funny how we have become a community of sorts, with all sorts of people taking part in commenting on the state of collapse."
1582206106273928,1:39:47,Anne M.,"Yes, we have 😃"
1582206145876548,1:40:27,Anne M.,@D Thomas Now the going concern is very briefly mentioned ....
1582206235100157,1:41:58,John Fagan,IS ..JACOB ZUMA...A...SPERM BANK
1582206256358954,1:42:17,Bonang Sithole,Actually SAA is non existent. it is not a going concern. it is long finished by Ausi Mistress Dudu Myeni
1582206284519032,1:42:47,John Fagan,YIP.....................................DEAD
1582206311763733,1:43:15,Anne M.,"@Bonang Sithole Sadly, yes"
1582206501504632,1:46:24,D Thomas,"@Anne M, Is SAA now in liquidation or under receivership?"
1582206564428981,1:47:26,adrian albertyn,Brilliant question.
1582206639775692,1:48:41,Teunis van Ree,"@D Thomas SAA is under business rescue, one last attempt to save it from bankruptcy"
1582206652999718,1:48:53,anya van loggerenberg,@clive oconnell you got that right 👍🏻
1582206712056760,1:49:55,Pastor J.J,Magda Sequin as not been online since last year@Lex Luger @Anne M. ...Maybe she is appearing on the chat as someone else and attacking all of us. Maybe she is Sipho the Xing.hahahahahaha
1582206747622834,1:50:28,Sandile Mkhonto,Going concern affects the presentation of the Financial statements.
1582206759749840,1:50:41,Paul Buchel,😎😀😀😀
1582206794526624,1:51:18,Vish Govender,It appears the AG was protecting SAA instead of doing due diligence
1582206886030442,1:52:48,Bernard Matolino,@Pastor J 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1582206892475767,1:52:53,D Thomas,"@Tennis Van Fee, thanks"
1582206985915080,1:54:27,D Thomas,@Teunis Van Ree sorry misspelled your name
1582206996601179,1:54:38,Pastor J.J,@Immanuel I chatted with her on the enca channel yesterday. She says she is blocked out of the SABC chats.
1582207094515302,1:56:15,Immanuel,"@Pastor J serious how sad, i will render this country ungovernable until she is unblocked as it were. who blocked her zuma?😁"
1582207130246816,1:56:51,Singi Mathebula,Auditors got captured as well 😪

1582207165652635,1:57:28,Vuyisani Sikobi,Ratio analysis and/or trend analysis should be able to foretell a looming problem
1582207257495953,1:59:00,Immanuel,@Pastor J when you come across her please tell her that her lobola is in my car boot ready to be dispatched😄😄
1582207298253514,1:59:41,Pastor J.J,Yes I will. an what do i tell katie?@Immanuel
1582207306411847,1:59:47,Vish Govender,Any business that is allowed to continue when it is clear that it is insolvent shows that something is seriously wrong. especially when others may suffer because of this. So the AG needs to explain.
1582207353107870,2:00:36,Immanuel,@Pastor J🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 tell katie her lobola is coming this weekend
1582207378816106,2:01:01,Pastor J.J,My silly sense of humor@Anne M. will get me imto trouble soon enough
1582207418177184,2:01:41,Anne M.,"I was laughing at your comment, because he doesn't come across as too intelligent"
1582207430378162,2:01:52,Pastor J.J,have a safe and blessed evening all
