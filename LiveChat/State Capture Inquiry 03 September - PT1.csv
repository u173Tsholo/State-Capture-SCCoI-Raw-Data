1567502825489670,1:51:52,Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu,guys who believes that watson is actually dead 4 real....or it's other way to end all of this in the public eye.....um saying this cs Zuma said he'll talk...and when he was called he revealed a lots
1567502850789523,1:52:18,mahfuz8599114,world should kiss our rsa hands
1567502859821557,1:52:26,Monica Mkhwebane,a
1567502891027826,1:52:58,Derek Main,@Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu I believe he is dead but I don't believe it was an accident.
1567502942477602,1:53:49,Derek Main,@mahfuz8599114 You don't seem to realise how insignificant we are in the bigger scheme of things.
1567502984563713,1:54:31,mahfuz8599114,you all are pro no doubt
1567503213331041,1:58:20,Raven Penny,let's call for commission to send you back from where you come from
1567503278066522,1:59:25,Karen x,What a fool you are Neo....Neo Mongale‚ÄãWe call for a commission of inquiry into apartheid and colonization now
1567503425867724,2:01:53,Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu,@Derek main ...lets agree to disagree cs i believe that his testmony would hv implicated lots of ppl on ur gov n that would scare away investors....so they agreed to fake his dead to end his part
1567503429349093,2:01:57,Mike Jones,Yes Neo...That would really help our future. When that comm's completed we can start another one to ventilate Chaka's brutalization of minor tribes.
1567503517625430,2:03:24,Raven Penny,neo go back to upper Africa
1567503526370476,2:03:33,Derek Main,@Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu I don't discount that possibility (for the reasons you've given). That's why I think it was a planned suicide. The timing of his death was just far too convenient.
1567503656167675,2:05:42,Derek Main,@Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu There are just too many questions. Why did he not fly through the windscreen? Why wasn't there a lot of blood since he have large gashes to his neck and face.
1567503737291067,2:07:05,Derek Main,@Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu Why didn't he brake? Why no cellphone or briefcase? Why in Toyota? Where was he going?
1567503863246281,2:09:10,Chris Welensky,they say one thing you can be sure of is death and taxes..imagine having some much money like GW that you kill yourself!
1567503977220717,2:11:03,Wildthing,Neo walking a thin line. stop the blame game and bring up ways to fix it. many students and people qualified looking for work that can replace the thieves out there. and they would do a better job
1567503980299613,2:11:07,Justin Kennerley,@Derek Main you don't always fly through the windscreen. Suicide seems the most likely answer.
1567504045969547,2:12:12,Derek Main,@Justin Kennerley No - you don't always but he wasn't wearing a seatbelt and was going very fast. He should at least have hit his head on windscreen (if not gone right through).
1567504073770526,2:12:40,Justin Kennerley,"Go watch crash test videos, the dummies hit the steering wheel"
1567504139157150,2:13:46,thando cezula,It's nice at the Gavin Watson funeral!
1567504191476909,2:14:38,Derek Main,@Justin Kennerley Are you saying no dummies go through windscreen? I would be very surprised.
1567504219116931,2:15:05,Wildthing,Justin/Derek. is it not a charge if you witness a crash and dont stop to help or call the police. I find it odd that both witnesses did not stop and only came forward 2 days later. they should charge
1567504326721546,2:16:53,Derek Main,@Yin Yang Yep - our ANC cadres have no qualms about fraternising with criminals. Birds of a feather and all that.
1567504362883852,2:17:30,Derek Main,@Michael Wild You might be right - I'm just not sure about that.
1567504454150118,2:19:00,Pastor J.J,@Michael Wild You are very right. A law does exist that requires every licensed motorist to stop and render and/or request assistance in the event of an accident and injuries
1567504481764784,2:19:28,Wildthing,"and the Cell phone still a mystery, and the fact that he only had R70 on him. but it all will be squashed. we will never know."
1567504717841928,2:23:24,Wildthing,Neo you here to talk about the subject or raise other issues. there are courts to claim land it you have proof.
1567504880978199,2:26:08,mthetheleli mndawe,This lady is all over the place

1567506077315906,2:46:04,Keith Hodgson,This advocate needs to prepare the words in her mind before speaking - very annoying hesitancy all the time.
1567506275526235,2:49:23,Reward Mushayabasa,She is very likeable. Always deferring to the chair
1567506471458218,2:52:38,Ibo Thabo,who she?
1567506472446957,2:52:39,Moshoeu Mabusela,Hlaudi is coming finally. can't wait to see him exposed.
1567506636191965,2:55:23,Nomsa Mdhluli,@Ibo Head of news
1567506671798850,2:55:59,Ibo Thabo,thanks @Nomsa Mdhluli
1567506844085024,2:58:51,Muzi Dube,@Mabusela....chief is that offical????????????????? if so I can't wait!!!!! love that human being!!!
1567506900736971,2:59:48,Moshoeu Mabusela,@Muzi Dube. he has been invited
1567506945929941,3:00:33,Ibo Thabo,So she is the right person to be ask the bugling mind question on: why the SABC website is so rubbish and their articles are so nonsensical & short in such way you can‚Äôt compare them to news24 or DM?
1567506983663299,3:01:10,Justin Kennerley,"@Ibo Thabo News24 and DM are newspapers, not broadcasters."
1567507033289532,3:01:59,Anne M.,@Justin Kennerley Both h ave journalists
1567507065199508,3:02:32,Justin Kennerley,"They have different mandates. The SABC journalists broadcast heir news, they don't write articles"
1567507079783081,3:02:46,Ibo Thabo,"@Justin Kennerley I said website, please go to the sites for the 3 media and see the clearer difference of what I am talking about."
1567507168959595,3:04:16,Justin Kennerley,"@Ibo Thabo exactly my point, the SABC's version of such a site, would be the radio and TV broadcasts. News24 needs a site with lengthy articles, because they don't use other means of spreading news."
1567507365664589,3:07:32,Pastor J.J,@Justin Kennerley Just a very small point to be made. News24 is probably a medium sized broadcaster of live events both on the Youtube platform and their own news site. This commission is live
1567507469199501,3:09:16,Ibo Thabo,"@Justin Kennerley most if not all of the SABC website and twitter accounts are badly written, out of date news & short etc, are you telling me that is normal? 1/2"
1567507490399499,3:09:37,Justin Kennerley,@Pastor J they moved to the digital space due to lower newspaper sales.
1567507493978616,3:09:40,Ibo Thabo,"@Justin Kennerley Can you look at CNN, BBC and Aljazeera etc and see how their written is? 2/2"
1567507512436266,3:09:59,Muzi Dube,@Mabusela hope he accptes the invite...
1567507527743011,3:10:15,Pastor J.J,correct@Justin Kennerley
1567507535620340,3:10:22,Justin Kennerley,Suffers
1567507583458683,3:11:10,Justin Kennerley,Lack of money = lack of improvement and innovation
1567507623315911,3:11:50,Derek Main,Brazen looting = lack of money
1567507668738934,3:12:35,Ibo Thabo,"@Justin Kennerley I guess not just staff shortage but intelligence, skill, and seriousness shortage."
1567507776808804,3:14:23,Justin Kennerley,Plus a lack of leadership that effectively enforces rules and prcoesses.
1567507807381678,3:14:54,Ibo Thabo,@Justin Kennerley Keep in mind the over R250 million salaries we pay to those incompetents every month
1567507875170926,3:16:02,Pastor J.J,Lets blame it all on the Silly Goat Cloudy Hlaudi.
