1542095604104826,-8:28,Ashley Morgan,now Ist that the former president Zuma administration has place many official and Minister's into unbearable situation. Barbra Hogan testimony placed the former president in the helm of stste capture
1542095884048335,-3:48,Wesley M,Jacob Zuma is not the architect of state capture. the ANC is the architect. Zuma was just part of it. Julius Malema did not fight corruption. Malema himself is corrupt.
1542095939580198,-2:52,Wesley M,Malema was fighting against Zuma because Zuma snubbed them and went with the Gupta's.
1542095972645616,-2:19,Wesley M,not because of corruption.
1542096094371517,-0:17,Wesley M,"the ANC, ASCP, COSATU, Julius Malema was fighting for Zuma to be President. when he already had the arms deal saga on his neck. people wake up."
1542096165681563,0:45,Walles Moyo,lol personally i think the Guptas came with positive attributes to South Africa
1542096193584623,1:13,Norman Zwane,Hi all - trust people today are interested in the testimony rather their own opinions
1542096367231936,4:07,Nelson Musoliwa,"The ANC is not on trial here but the ""ruling party is"""
1542096388872867,4:28,Vusi Mbambiso,"With all due respect, Ashley, nothing in the evidence so far has anything to do with state capture. The whole day was wasted on cabinet workings!"
1542096399260010,4:39,Andre' Van Zyl,all correct wesley
1542096516978157,6:37,Wesley M,for Ramaphosa the ANC is more important then South Africa. He will not tell you that. but look at his moves.
1542096576159817,7:36,tshepo aaron,"vusi beg to differ, the name that is often mentioned here is Jacob Zuma and we all know the role played in the state capture."
1542096780345187,11:00,Vusi Mbambiso,But we have not heard anything that even resembles state capture! All the characters so far were government officials and politicians!
1542096822727490,11:42,Zoleka Mdluli,lol @Thato
1542096847604106,12:07,Mpho Kgomo,"Thato their uniform means serious biznis, cleaning and getting rid of rubbish. They will SPRING THIS COUNTRY."

1542097126613461,16:46,Andre' Van Zyl,julius will destroy this country with his hate. Its all consuming.
1542097208427167,18:07,Mpho Kgomo,"@ Thando, so Mrs. Hogan held this post for a year becoz she did not agree with JZ this is hard evidence and more she understands the procedure of Governance that is hard evidence."

1542097697427506,26:17,Vusi Mbambiso,"@ Mopho, Gama is the unluckiest CEO I know. He was dismissed at TFR in 2010. He only became Transnet after Brian Molefe moved to Eskom. How did he let the Guptas loot?"

1542097977520044,30:57,Lorna Kavanagh,yes i am sure you are right Thando but i was just wondering if the deal was worth 84 billion.
1542097989665133,31:09,Nooneisnoone,Indian curry must be delicious...

1542098285878668,36:05,Vusi Mbambiso,"For now, this is entertainment. No relevant evidence yet ttat talks to State Capture!"
1542098307300983,36:27,Speckled Trim,Expensive entertainment funded by the tax payer. Niel Blomkamp should take a hint and put parliament on the Hollywood map. We can make back all the money Zupta (allegedly) stole.
1542098317753737,36:37,noko yamebetlwa,we also need inquiry to question them why they were killing black people
1542098324216282,36:44,Lorna Kavanagh,Malusi Gigaba .... this will be interesting.

1542098455739388,38:55,NKANYISO BRANDON DUBE,What‚Äôs the whole point of this inquiry? How many inquiries have we had before? And what happened after?
1542098552677829,40:32,noko yamebetlwa,Dune this inquiry is for taking ex President prison in Limpopo to wear orange
1542098572468594,40:52,Jeffrey Magongoe,@NKANYISO BRANDON DUBE showing us how foolish we are as SA citizens that politicians loot while we idolise
1542098594439562,41:14,Vusi Mbambiso,"""State Capture"" is self-explanatory. It is the Capture of a legitimate government by external forces! So far none of that was said here!"
1542098603598741,41:23,Mpho Kgomo,"@ Nkanyiso let's hang in there and be positive, there are a lot of life lessons to be learnt here."
1542098674894294,42:34,Zoleka Mdluli,Noko.. what do you mean ?
1542098677720653,42:37,Lorna Kavanagh,we hope that this inquiry will lead to charges been laid against 'corrupt' people and the law will take its course. SA is in a recession due to largely state capture and tax payers money stolen. I
1542098726894527,43:26,Speckled Trim,If you make a pact with 3 out of top 6 you will control the state from there üëç the rest are pawns.
1542098752182804,43:52,Mark Waner,i believe this one is different. Judge Zondo appears to be a man of utmost integrity.
1542098765686819,44:05,Mzimkhulu Gqadu,There are things that are happening behind closed doors and this commision its tying to revealed all those secrets.

1542098832370397,45:12,Lorna Kavanagh,Zuma must come and tell what he is and isn't responsible for.
1542098851202452,45:31,Wesley M,Tumelo are you still there? i want to tell you one last thing.
1542098856094810,45:35,Mark Waner,Zuma will never appear.
1542098866146486,45:46,Fabian Moodley,"zuma will get off all this stuff, it's always the case"

1542099019591556,48:19,Mpho Kgomo,Zuma will testify gathering the evidence before he rocks up is imperative the more he delays the bigger the risk he is skating on very thin ice.
1542099032816555,48:32,NKANYISO BRANDON DUBE,Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Seems like when we took over governance. We were not read to govern. Seems to be like a movie scrip that is constantly written by different people.
1542099111937997,49:51,Ayanda Kleyi,"By the time they get to Court or Investigated, Zuma and his son plus the Guptas would have long finished shredding this info we are hearing here and the shredder would be cold by then."

1542099214921907,51:34,Wesley M,Jacob Zuma is not the architect of state capture. the ANC is Zuma was only part of the. he just took things to the extreme.
1542099234528067,51:54,lawrence tele,where are these white people from Pretoria here.

1542099281268258,52:41,Mpho Kgomo,The problem with this party is that they have hidden personal agenda's
1542099314190228,53:13,Cassius Mngomezulu,"All parties are the same, no better ones"
1542099314209026,53:13,Wesley M,The ANC implemented state capture long before Zuma was president. that's Why the ANC made Zuma president.
1542099322012320,53:21,noko yamebetlwa,Fabian I agree with u
1542099415443030,54:55,Fabian Moodley,"then again I don't blame Zuma, he's drive for money lead to this"

1542099493497874,56:13,Ayanda Kleyi,"I don't get why would this take 2 years, cause now we know who are the culprits why not stop and prosecute, I hope Glynnis Breytenbach becomes DNPP soon."
1542099575955426,57:35,Mpho Kgomo,State Capture has always been around it's just that Zuma exposed the reality or its existence
1542099584221444,57:44,Phillo Beukes,"Best you start seeing what the effect of Zuma and the ANC's theft and corruption has on you when there is no money left for water, sanitation and housing, no jobs, and a failing health system."
