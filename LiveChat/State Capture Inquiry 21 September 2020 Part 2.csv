1600690804944456,15:37,Tlakale Motswiane,"Since his previous appearance, I like how Mr Mokhethi replies: straight to the point and he admits there and there if what they did is not in line with processes. He is trying his best..."
1600690812139368,15:45,Mbuso Ndlovu,@brutos17 Locking Zuma will not solve the problem. We need all the monies payed back
1600690818245716,15:51,Val Speirs,I think the department's deliberately allowed the Tender validity period to expire in order to run away with the money.
1600690844933911,16:18,L Ll,No criminal case is going to follow. They will recommend tighter checks and balances. Just improve the tender system. Forget about anyone being charged with a crime 😩
1600690860367652,16:32,Chad MacCrae,trying his best!!!! he tried his best to loot from our tax money
1600690895750941,17:09,Val Speirs,Zuma must be hand cuffed to the Witness chair.
1600690952431025,18:05,brutos17,@Mbuso Ndlovu every month they push back the trial!!! locking up Zuma is the first step to getting back the U$ 29 billion he stole!!!!!😡
1600690954135574,18:06,Chad MacCrae,Zuma's must be handcuffed to a super maximum prison and key thrown away
1600690981029751,18:34,Tlakale Motswiane,@Chad Aimes i am with you on the looting but my point is he is nowhere near the likes of Nomvula in trying to cover his a$$
1600691064204681,19:57,L Ll,Nah Zuma doesn’t have that kind of money unless you can prove it beyond any reasonable doubt lol
1600691091717628,20:23,Christian Mngadi,nkosiyami lobaba kodwa

1600691168729448,21:42,L Ll,And it’s usually CASH transactions
1600691203091178,22:16,A Luta Continua,"Lying, thieving and not capable of running a bath. Yet smart enough to buy shelf companies to loot, dumb enough to not understand company law and the tax implications though..."
1600691212460123,22:26,Fred Desrosiers,we all do not understand either
1600691224018608,22:37,L Ll,The money is being used for covid relief in America 😡😩😳
1600691228437267,22:41,brutos17,@L Ll South African news will never tell you how much money Zuma stole!! think about govt spending for South Africa and the Guptas... its usually hidden in a Deutsche Bank account in Switzerland!!!
1600691235395962,22:48,Nkaviso Confidence,"The Chair can't understand,and I too don't understand 😏😏😏"
1600691266197961,23:18,L Ll,Brutos yes you are right about that
1600691297766889,23:50,Chad MacCrae,What we need to understand is what is this commission going to do with all this evidence
1600691319463148,24:13,L Ll,Nothing lol
1600691320547886,24:14,Val Speirs,Foreign Bank accounts must be investigated.
1600691350838907,24:43,Blake Yogi,"There is no acceptable answer, chair. Love Mr Pretorius simplicity of facts"

1600691384452918,25:17,Mbuso Ndlovu,Malema was once a Tenderprenuer before Zuma fired him
1600691400280130,25:33,L Ll,Swiss banks are actually using the money to improve their economy while SA people are suffering
1600691420760607,25:53,Chad MacCrae,I don't understand prisons are full with petty thieves...so the law is actually to steal big to avoid prison
1600691438660936,26:12,A Luta Continua,"Why does nobody mention Porsche SA, Aston Martin SA, Sun international hyprop and many others who accept payment for their goods and services without due FICA diligfence. They are just as culpable"
1600691448487530,26:21,FieliesSA,"If I knew so little of the department that I was appointed to, I would be kicked out before month end..."
1600691472398911,26:45,Mbuso Ndlovu,Cyril must just make more copies of R200 notes then we we all be rich😂🤣😂🤣
1600691547688251,28:00,Danie Nilsen,lol my contractor also disapeared into qwa qwa and then i was asked to complete the project after an amendment was made how much was needed to complete the work
1600691581643221,28:35,FieliesSA,"@Canis Africanis Its still a start. If ""Cloudy"" was still at SABS, they would have silenced this"
1600691594926081,28:48,FieliesSA,*SABC

1600691628177710,29:21,Mbuso Ndlovu,SAA must be sold
1600691658563839,29:51,Fred Desrosiers,"@A Luta Continua, we are all cupable for not voting properly. do not vote party, vote for people with character"
1600691714657570,30:48,Thabo Mokoaleli,Mokgetsi has given up. He has already seen that he has been caught by hard facts. He is now voluntarily complying with everything 🤣🤷😂
1600691785638199,31:58,Chad MacCrae,he doesn't need to hide..he is rich and he knows nothing is going to happen to him
1600691827101344,32:40,A Luta Continua,Lets sign the petition then to change the voting system then that maimane is advocating!
1600691841777041,32:54,Mbuso Ndlovu,"Correct, Yess🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
1600691848918540,33:01,Fred Desrosiers,"@canis Africanis, yes. I know but how to separate the thieves from honest people"
1600691930291807,34:23,Fred Desrosiers,I am getting the feeling the ANC itself is captured and rotten from inside.
1600691937317984,34:29,Chad MacCrae,even if we vote for a honourable person..its more about who the person is going to be surrounded by...the people around them
1600691961191214,34:54,Thabo Mokoaleli,"I am waiting for a moment where is going to mention his principal, Ace Magashule 🤣🤷😂🙈"
1600692019946632,35:53,Blake Yogi,it aint the light bothering him. its these sins bothering him
1600692038904246,36:12,Chad MacCrae,😂😂😂😂
1600692056272638,36:29,Angelo Doubel,🤣🤣🤣
1600692072013517,36:45,Chad MacCrae,we said the same for previous president
1600692125292006,37:38,khulekani bonelani,@Chad Aimes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1600692128243294,37:42,MASEGO mpitsang,@Blake Yogi the irony of the light and the sins🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1600692199515834,38:52,Chad MacCrae,canis Cyril is just another face to the ANC..but the same outfit
1600692229414196,39:22,Bonang Sithole,Commissions are part of accountability. So I will vote ANC again because they account through Commissions and other gatherings
1600692258257335,39:51,Blake Yogi,@Masego 🤣
1600692274703532,40:08,Fred Desrosiers,"@A Luta Continua, Maimane is currently he is not organized well enough to make any changes."
1600692300911733,40:34,Blake Yogi,"@Canis, you win quote of the day ""who's your we"" 🤣🤣"
1600692318600881,40:51,A Luta Continua,"To get SA back we need to eradicate the ANC from every decision making office in our land, as it has never been clearer how incompetent they are on every level, ""We"" are those who will clean your mess"
1600692365434716,41:37,Chad MacCrae,this is commission does not deal with accountability they just showing us responsibilty of all involved
1600692387907820,42:03,KgaitseweM,@Bonang Sithole accountability without justice is not accountability. taxpayers have been funding this commission to run for a long time and who is in jail now?
1600692410377912,42:24,Chad MacCrae,true
1600692559546816,44:51,Fred Desrosiers,"@KgaitseweM, jail is not enough, they must lose power. The power of government facilitates their looting"
1600692625836283,45:58,Blake Yogi,Exactly Chad. the commision is an inquiry. they bring facts. They will send a report + recommendations.NPA will take it from there to bring accountability. So glad someone finally understands the word
1600692715936537,47:28,Chad MacCrae,which goes against every definition of what a democratic country is
1600692719993605,47:32,Morwa Azania,"since the banks are clearly refusing to finance black owned emerging businesses, who were they going to carry out the works? I support Advance payment initiative, otherwise Blacks will remain workers"
1600692748464789,48:02,Blake Yogi,"If only everyone understood this is an inquiry only, we wouldnt have people asking why nobody is arrested. Its getting so exhausting"
1600692786931285,48:40,Thabo Mokoaleli,"Mokgetsi is collaborating positively, maybe he is looking for a plea bargain for future trials🤷😂🤣🙈"
1600692858481809,49:51,Blake Yogi,"@Thabo, Mokhesi has realized if he lies more, he is digging himself into the ground"
1600692911577683,50:45,Morwa Azania,"@Fred, we're talking abt a over 10 million rands deals. not snax from a sphaza shop"
1600692916340202,50:49,Chad MacCrae,true..its a loophole for corruption
1600692934027700,51:07,Fred Desrosiers,"@Eric Sithole, blacks need to start and manage own banks"
1600692994229293,52:07,Thabo Mokoaleli,"All in all a Tender system must be scrapped, it is a source of Corruption 😂🤣"
1600693014974319,52:28,Blake Yogi,"@Thabo, you are onto something."
1600693020981692,52:33,Morwa Azania,"@Fred, the procedure to establish Black owned Banks- doesn't seem easy, hence I say something systematically must have been done"
1600693053702052,53:06,visibly annoyed,"@Eric Sithole thats my problem with the ANC, how is it that these things are going on while we have a so called black govenment."
1600693072886909,53:26,Morwa Azania,"n to add on that, look at the noise been made towards vbs- is like they don't want any black owned bank to exist again"
1600693125915960,54:17,Sameer Bhosale,jai India....................................
1600693151228373,54:44,Chad MacCrae,no we don't have a black govt.we have an ANC govt..they only care to enrich themselves who are in power and gain as much as possible while they in power
1600693177510874,55:10,Sameer Bhosale,Jay India.................................................Jay hind Jay India
1600693183788952,55:16,a b c,"It's been clear for a long time that the ANC doesn't care about black people... thry just want their votes and bring up apartheid as a red herring every time someone exposes them,"
1600693236291163,56:09,A Luta Continua,Ask another question....Why are ANC cadres buying property in Portugal?
1600693261527487,56:35,a b c,It's not about race... it's about corruption... they try to turn everything into a race issue as a distraction
1600693299145482,57:12,a b c,@Blake Yogi Exactly!! All these tactics are jusr messed up
1600693309003053,57:21,kevindbn007,Well said @ Chad
1600693348358025,58:01,A Luta Continua,Its always about race in this country...Do you guys not listen to the cucumber in chief of the EFF
1600693350656388,58:03,kevindbn007,....Ace your time has come
1600693381882502,58:34,Morwa Azania,@Visibly do you still believe anc has made this laws? Nna I think this things were written n given to anc n the same anc acted like Jet Li's n told us they wrote the laws n regulations
1600693382106600,58:34,Blake Yogi,"and yet she was eating and had a birthday party of over R100 000 and came back to confess,"
1600693400451713,58:54,Blake Yogi,@Kevin I am waiting for that day I tell you
1600693401018570,58:55,kevindbn007,I see this week being a shift in the ANC and how the top brass will shine
1600693402614583,58:55,Angelo Doubel,@ a b c yep. and they like blame Apartheid for their corruption
1600693408964989,59:01,a b c,Well they make everything about race but what they really care about is the money... they just use race as a diversion
1600693427651832,59:20,kevindbn007,the race card is old news now
1600693436706005,59:29,kevindbn007,just stinking selfish thieves
1600693438007533,59:31,Ntsikelelo Lucas,ALL ANIMALS ARE EQAUL BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS
1600693447330524,59:40,kevindbn007,is that the legacy thats gonna be left
1600693450515144,59:43,a b c,@Angelo Doubel Exactly... and many supporters just go with it...
1600693461292710,59:53,kevindbn007,thats how ppl will view the anc
1600693475603698,1:00:08,Blake Yogi,"@a b c, Mokonyane said there were no opportunities in the past to explain why she got a 2.2mil deposit for her 3 Mil car"
1600693478356200,1:00:11,kevindbn007,pity the bad apples really screwed up this country
1600693480598964,1:00:14,Chad MacCrae,ANC believe they were the only ones previously disadvantaged therefore justified all the looting yet forgetting about the current disadvantaged
1600693529137580,1:01:02,kevindbn007,"ANC is, selfish, self seeking, willing to kiil, rob and steal from the poorest of the poor, to enrich themselves..... when will those votes see"
1600693534823401,1:01:06,Wife Beater 976,stop
1600693537651806,1:01:09,Rakatsinyane Tsolo,Radical economic looting of Zuma and Magashule
1600693548974239,1:01:21,Blake Yogi,"@Kevin, I do believe that there are race issues, but I dont believe its an explanation for corruption. Taking a real issue and grossly warping it."
1600693559776276,1:01:31,a b c,@Blake Yogi lol... she ran out of somewhat useful things to say... it's all so hypocritical
1600693575366783,1:01:47,a b c,@Blake Yogi agree on the race thing
1600693581020297,1:01:54,kevindbn007,"@Blake, its the ONLY excuse being used when they caught"
1600693617127239,1:02:30,kevindbn007,"@Blake, 25yurs on, thats the life of a person born, schooled and been to Uni"
1600693617843025,1:02:31,A Luta Continua,Champagne socialists with red overalls to fool the muppets...cameras should focus on the R40.000 Tom fords & Prada's. Unfortunately the masses see this as aspirational & keep voting these clowns in
1600693619520374,1:02:32,Angelo Doubel,@ a b c look this situation 500 000 houses was never built. R 1 billion missing. how many poor people could have benefitted. 🤔
1600693629401992,1:02:42,Ntyab Mninw Mninw,WE are Not in ä Point of stop blamming the past without economic equality and Land equality.
1600693645974900,1:02:57,Blake Yogi,"@Kevin, no it isnt. some use gender as well. He is slandering my name cos Im a woman"
1600693662307953,1:03:15,kevindbn007,eish
1600693674392284,1:03:27,Chad MacCrae,there is no excuse because if I must go now into a shop and steal a packet of chips I'm going to be arrested..how is race going to be an excuse for breaking a law
1600693685248059,1:03:38,a b c,I wish people would see things through reality... race/gender/age whatever is just an old excuse that has no bearing... corruption is corruption
1600693694278004,1:03:46,Val Speirs,Then to be equal you must pay for the land because it was not free.
1600693705539357,1:03:58,Blake Yogi,"and yet, some even use lack of education."
1600693709836359,1:04:04,kevindbn007,Action SA is something to look at
1600693711508961,1:04:05,a b c,@Angelo Doubel they're heartles man
1600693754949404,1:04:47,Fred Desrosiers,Yes. But Actiin SA needs to start promoting itself.
1600693755645952,1:04:48,kevindbn007,They knew Mr Zondo
1600693757513485,1:04:51,Blake Yogi,yet smart enough to create sly corruption plans and so elegantly cover it up
1600693778915996,1:05:13,kevindbn007,from their own cousins
1600693791016951,1:05:23,a b c,I shortly listened to Al Sharpton on Sun... I think his mentality is just feeding the fire...
1600693793775960,1:05:27,Himesh Mothi,"the thing about the apartheid government was that we knew they were corrupt, we didn't elect them to represent us"
1600693838809727,1:06:12,A Luta Continua,@Ntyab Mninw Mninw You want land.....Go earn it. You just want a handout....Chances are you will sell it ASAP to go buy yourself a mercedes benz
1600693864202259,1:06:35,kevindbn007,"a nation that looks constantly to the past and alwyas blames the past, will never progress forward"
1600693866944877,1:06:40,Himesh Mothi,"yet these anc cadres think it's ok to rob the very people that put them there, and its justified because they were disadvantaged"
1600693868291964,1:06:41,Chad MacCrae,but what's the same is that nothing could be done about corruption then and now
1600693875879604,1:06:48,a b c,Yeah... some people may know they're corrupt but since they benefit from the corruption they keep the ANC in power...
1600693938976393,1:07:52,a b c,And when they're not blaming white folk they're blaming foreigners who are here legally
1600693951238288,1:08:03,Val Speirs,I don't believe the apartheid regime was ever as corrupt as the ANC.
1600693956131887,1:08:08,makhosi nobhatyi,SA is very corrupt
1600693956623455,1:08:09,kevindbn007,"learn from the past, never dwell on it"
1600693970842524,1:08:24,Himesh Mothi,"I fail to understand how earning a salary of millions a year disadvantages you , yet u taking money that was destined for people who do not know where their next meal is comming from"
1600694020709118,1:09:14,kevindbn007,1Bil = 1000 Million.......................sheeeeeeu
1600694022597610,1:09:16,Blake Yogi,"@Val, the issue there wasnt corruption, it was crime against humanity. Something we cant minimize especially minimizing the impact it had on the lives of others"
1600694071287125,1:10:04,Himesh Mothi,sa needs to realise corruption has no color...if anything it's worse when people indigenous to our land rob their own
1600694090662480,1:10:24,Val Speirs,Two different crimes.
1600694095382149,1:10:27,a b c,"@Continua it's not ""chances are"" they will definitely sell the land after acquiring it... I've spoken to a bunch of people who want land and they admit that they won't actually use it but just sell it"
1600694100813648,1:10:34,Blake Yogi,Corruption and Apartheid are both rotten and disgusting but they cannot be compared. They must be treated seperately
1600694104320015,1:10:36,ANCHOR,do these people have guilt conscious in them? I mean he's probably still enjoying state's services.
1600694131922433,1:11:05,Val Speirs,What the ANC has denied the poor is Crimes against Humanity.
1600694148291191,1:11:21,kevindbn007,we need to sue the ANC
1600694148780993,1:11:21,Himesh Mothi,Blake apartheid was a system
1600694155448642,1:11:27,Chad MacCrae,yes because his innocent untold proven guilty in COURT
1600694157750412,1:11:31,ANCHOR,do they even get arrested after
1600694172614159,1:11:45,Himesh Mothi,but that does mean its practices were not corrupt
1600694198359652,1:12:12,Himesh Mothi,they looted money the very same way it's been looted now
1600694227374129,1:12:40,Himesh Mothi,Zuma was the worst door
