1599555262352019,1:06:41,Aubrey De Bliquy,A directive to stop the business of Eskom does seem sinister and does raise fundamental questions.
1599555299224958,1:07:18,Abele Maketsi,eeeeee
1599555350453934,1:08:08,Aubrey De Bliquy,This chairman is impressive.

1599555477651977,1:10:16,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Syug without even putting it in writing which suggests in itself an incompetence and subservience to authority without accountability.
1599555569233023,1:11:47,Thobani Mkananda,Who was the minister then fellas?
1599555594345657,1:12:13,Pheladi Lamola,I wish there was a way to claim back the salaries paid to people like Mr Tsotsi here.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1599555729636095,1:14:27,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Patrick .Solarnfo Do you agree eskom faiure to be able to supply enough electricity is as fundamental a failure as any country can make.
1599555762559992,1:15:00,Patrick .Solarnfo,"No No Aubrey, im not there at all"

1599555812190197,1:15:50,Aubrey De Bliquy,Load shedding is in itself an admission of epic failure. It's not dust buildup on insulators like we got when this started.
1599555861845241,1:16:40,Rory Lee Farnham,"Bottom line, it will be proven Tsotsi is a Tsotsi."
1599555908183564,1:17:26,Patrick .Solarnfo,WHEN DID WE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED REAL LOAD-SHADING?
1599555908291691,1:17:26,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Patrick .Solarnfo So you think load shedding is something routine in a functioning country>
1599555934244252,1:17:52,Patrick .Solarnfo,"@Aubrey De Bliquy , yes and no"
1599555964450239,1:18:23,Tebogo Meso,:yougotthis:
1599556005359491,1:19:03,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Patrick .Solarnfo are you aware of the disruptive costs of load shedding to industry? Sme factories are disasterously disrupted.
1599556020747535,1:19:19,Patrick .Solarnfo,Mismanagement can occur at any entity without corruption being in the center of affairs
1599556081058725,1:20:19,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Patrick incompetence that is not in Eskom is incompetence de-facto in government.
1599556136630292,1:21:14,ma baker,I like the slight smile on adv's face.
1599556218571605,1:22:36,Patrick .Solarnfo,Lol...is this adv a brother from another mother of Adv V. Maleka. hahaha
1599556237061086,1:22:55,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Patrick .Solarnfo incompetence in business is regulated by bankruptcies. Eskom cannot have a monopoly and plead incompetence thus holding all hostage.
1599556250450264,1:23:08,ma baker,you need not go further chair. the visits says everything.
1599556302065457,1:23:59,Patrick .Solarnfo,hahaha...

1599556423355732,1:26:01,Patrick .Solarnfo,Because the matter of Eskom is quite complex and now i am lost at exactly what we are taking about
1599556430708198,1:26:08,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Patrick .Solarnfo My point is that Eskom cannot be allowed to hold a monopoly over a vital national service they are incapable of providing.
1599556448960994,1:26:27,Patrick .Solarnfo,Yes!
1599556451710075,1:26:28,Jacqui Baumgardt,@Aubrey De Bliquy -agree

1599556470912264,1:26:49,Pheladi Lamola,Imagine Eskom sponsoring the ANC January 8 gala!!!
1599556502043564,1:27:19,Syug,Eskom funded the ANC dinner?
1599556517269477,1:27:35,Aubrey De Bliquy,Yet the law provides eskom a legislated monopoly on electricity supply thus holding the economy to ransom
1599556538883878,1:27:56,Thobani Mkananda,Tsotsi is bringing a new phrase 'I seem to recall' which is ambiguous. Let's listen carefully ü§î

1599556760591740,1:31:08,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Pheladi Lamola I think their is a corrupt mindset that cannot comprehend the concept of conflict of interest.

1599556838142275,1:32:26,Dorothea Œöarapurtzidou,No body talk about injuries and victims and victimisation again and again. the power abuse and transperancy of statutory bodies around Europe? . Police administration and individuals cases? Justice?
1599556851048715,1:32:37,Patrick .Solarnfo,Gwede Mantash is an obvious case
1599556895162405,1:33:24,Aubrey De Bliquy,I see Eskom failure as a collective failure not to be laid at the door of any one incumbent because this infrastructure requires 20 year foresight and planning
1599556945192279,1:34:13,L Alexander,I personally don't see what's wrong with Eskom sponsoring some ANC events. It can have a direct impact on increasing your profits.
1599556984302164,1:34:52,Tebogo Sibilanga,"As long as Eskom continues to be an ANC project and remote controlled by politicians, loadshedding will remain permanent"

1599557147652047,1:37:36,Sibongile Maputi,I am not sure how Tsotsi is gonna answer the question on the table. The ANC must answer. Why do SOEs find it appropriate to sponsor events of a political party?
1599557151612669,1:37:40,Patrick .Solarnfo,Wena Luyanda u must appear before the commission of inquiry at how dont u understand that is wrong
1599557157237708,1:37:46,Mike Newlands,@Luyanda A It creates an opportunity for corruption and would you object to Eskom sponsoring a DA event?
1599557201305432,1:38:29,Patrick .Solarnfo,Or even Freedom Front Plus dinner
1599557218098030,1:38:46,Velile Ndlovu,@Luyanda - whose profits are U referring to? Eskom has been making losses every year for the past 2 decades @ least!!
1599557238212841,1:39:06,Mike Newlands,@Luyanda A these are political parties not charities or would you support ESkom supporing FF Plus
1599557286003353,1:39:54,Tebogo Sibilanga,"The role of Eskom is to provide quality and uninterrupted power supply to the citizens, no to wine and dine politicians."
1599557295723698,1:40:04,L Alexander,"No I don't object to that at all. The DA for example hosts many functions with leading business role players, so Eskom could very well sponsor the event."
1599557302805470,1:40:09,L Alexander,Why do companies sponsor events?
1599557335034639,1:40:43,Aubrey De Bliquy,"@Luyanda A Eskom is granted a monopoly service vital to the nation. They provide a service that provides 20 year planning. which could span EFF, ANC, IFP administrations in theory."

1599557513836530,1:43:42,Mike Newlands,"@Luyanda A Actually your question is exactly why this countr a failed basket case.The DA can be sponsored sure BUT NOT with tax payers money,if a PRIVATE company sponsers DA thats their moneynot mine."
1599557520418677,1:43:49,Salome Seabi,He is just playing with our minds
1599557538942789,1:44:06,Mathieuw Muyenga,It's the ANC..... the TOP SIX. ... the GUPTAS....... why always. .....
1599557551552185,1:44:20,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Salome Seabi Perhaps that says more about the consensus on corruption than CR who the moment he had the authority as president declared his intention to end corruption as he now is doing.
1599557579771559,1:44:47,MOGAMAT DHARFEUR HENDRICKS,are they still on tea

1599557654358415,1:46:03,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Mike Clark I think even a private company uses OUR MONEY since we allow corporations to profit off our economy and people.
1599557657823310,1:46:06,Mfundo,we are back the action continua like aluta
1599557659927001,1:46:06,L Alexander,"@Mike Clark Haha, I literally just asked a question to understand it better. But go ahead and hurl more insults if it makes you feel betterüòâ"
1599557823587603,1:48:36,FieliesSA,"@Luyanda A But it can be extended. Companies sponsor events to win favor. Normally more favor means, more ""business"" or support. But when its ANC and taxpayers money, its more like bribery"
1599557920957766,1:49:30,Aubrey De Bliquy,We cant say like FU eskom we are going to buy our electricity from a company that supports EFF.

1599558318474710,1:53:57,Aubrey De Bliquy,Yup @Patrick .Solarnfo 100% agree. Any incumbent could use authority over eskom to sponsor party political functions. I never joined the witch hunt against JZ and feel the same about CR.

1599558518324572,1:57:43,Tebogo Sibilanga,Eskom is a cash cow for the ANC vultures. They want the entity to remain monopolised so that they continue to feed off it. Nomvula told us his husband was confident of an eskom tender
