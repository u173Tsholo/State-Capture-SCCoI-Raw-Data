1548841114457398,1:36:13,The Vuka Experience,White peoples have no right to tell us what is and what is not racist. You lost that right in 1884 at the Berlin Conference.
1548841133055568,1:36:32,Buyiswa Mnyani,@CUMA NTANGANA too much anger. I think they are power hungry.
1548841134937089,1:36:34,Robbie Irlam,"Jeez, how many vaults did they have?"
1548841141034743,1:36:40,Myka'Al Daud,Only a fool can have all his land stolen and not be angry
1548841151190460,1:36:50,CUMA NTANGANA,and we cant let this beautiful nation to be led by anger people...😂😂😂😂
1548841185844735,1:37:25,M Peer,Are free shares to politically connected individuals not corruption. Most ANC NEC members accepted shares. Stop bickering and see the light.
1548841198213392,1:37:37,Robbie Irlam,First logical comment @CUMA NTANGANA
1548841201141024,1:37:40,CUMA NTANGANA,that guy is angry tjoo😂😂😂 that red color is not a joke

1548841239140864,1:38:18,Derek Main,@King Vuka I disagree - we all have the same right to call out racism
1548841257437263,1:38:37,kay singh,"corruption is about an individuals greed ...has nothing to do about race ,religion or culture"
1548841294185647,1:39:13,Myka'Al Daud,"Africans can't be racists,racism comes from Europe"

1548841315613135,1:39:35,Chunky To Spunky,WOW 😮
1548841321131059,1:39:40,The Vuka Experience,@Derek Main I didn’t say “call out” I said “tell us” which means define. Yes please call out but don’t impose its definition on us. There has never been a system to oppress whites for them to know.
1548841327186365,1:39:46,Derek Main,"@Neo Mongale That might have been true before 1994 but it's not true now. By that argument, whites born after 1994 can't be racist - and we all know that's not true"
1548841356356091,1:40:15,jeevan singh,Neo. are you EFF..
1548841358328621,1:40:17,Musa Bakiti,Afrikaans destroyed this country it needs a strong minded leader like Juju and Loyd under the flag of EFF.
1548841373645449,1:40:32,CUMA NTANGANA,anger can cloud the judgement of an educated mind. so even their education is overpowered by their anger😂😂😂
1548841376810068,1:40:36,Myka'Al Daud,"Derek u r dreaming,and racism have blinded u"
1548841386784538,1:40:46,Derek Main,@King Vuka Racism is discriminating on the basis of skin colour. It's long been defined and no longer needs defining
1548841413350119,1:41:12,Siba Mfabe,We cant even inherit racism if we do not have the things that give it power. Colonialism has to unfortunately accept that its greatest global exports were racism; eploitation & inequality.
1548841413668748,1:41:13,Adam Makwinja,Black people have always and will always pour their hearts to all other kind of races across the world yet among-est ourselves we carry that hatred for one another. Trying to understand why?????

1548841439302157,1:41:38,The Vuka Experience,@Derek Main the only thing we got lost 1994 was the right to vote. White people lost nothing. Even at CODESA whites lost nothing. This commission proves whites run the economy
1548841448887688,1:41:48,Myka'Al Daud,"Derek it was defined by racists,hear the decolonized definition of racism"

1548841519185489,1:42:58,The Vuka Experience,"@Derek Main if that’s what racism is then you are downplaying what colonists did because they didn’t just hate our skin colour, they hated our existence."
1548841529367583,1:43:08,Jake,"@King Vuka, No man, whites paid money because of the BEE system and to keep the money going, the commission shows that blacks took all the dodgy monies and made them selves rich, ANC been in power"

1548841642984241,1:45:01,Derek Main,"@King Vuka Then why don't you rather say ""We hate anyone with feelings of superiority"" - why associate it with ALL whites?"
1548841644972345,1:45:03,Chunky To Spunky,I think 🤔 they should be hanged
1548841650293148,1:45:09,Mzalwane Mzala,Van Tonder will be the most damning witness in a court of law. He was a CFO and he is not flamboyant but boringly deal with facts. That sends criminals to jail even if it not viewed as sensational.
