1582272660266998,6:40,Just watch this Guys,please teach him how to pronounce 'determine'
1582272800365900,9:01,EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,You sure you can not teach him yourself hahaha. Clearly failure to pronounce that word does not change the overall point they set to articulate.
1582273080486481,13:42,Ibo Thabo,I am still straggling to understand why some South Africans particularly those lenient to a particular individual not want the state capture continue and these mess known to the Public
1582273102759495,14:05,Khaya Nkonki,Hoping after all the state capture is finished we will see people on the wrong side of the law will go to jail
1582273891318476,27:13,Tinashe Mangena,Hallo @Khaya Nkonki are related to Nkonki Inc? Just asking for a friend. üòÄ
1582274090439057,30:31,Jean-Pierre Le Roux,So according to news reports ...there will be no arrests for state capture. It is the law...
1582274344666337,34:46,Paul Buchel,Agrissi and five others are out on bail. They were arrested.
1582274465433338,36:47,Amanda Watson,"@Jean-Pierre Le Rocks in the head likes to talk shyte. The full statement ends with ""until at least the end of the year""."
1582274524313528,37:46,Amanda Watson,‚ÄúIt would not be prudent to act on information and evidence now until the Commission makes a determination on the matter ...‚Äù
1582274956859439,44:58,Nkululeko Nyandeni,unless on cases where a witness admits to having committed an offense in line with tje terms of reference and the evidence is concrete.

1582275336770202,51:18,Ibo Thabo,At least she accept that she did deserve to be in jail @Luvuyo Zantsi
1582275664165432,56:45,hlengani khuvutlu,"@luvuyo, that lady is write when she say is not the only one,"
1582275752154209,58:13,Gerda 7,They should all go to jail...te whole board!!
1582275788648983,58:50,Vuyisani Sikobi,The problem in exonerating Dudu is that she has been involved in many shady activities and she seemed to have political influences
1582275999025969,1:02:21,postmaster,this witness is protecting the other bribed beancounters.
1582276022504564,1:02:44,Maryann Diamond,true
1582276111762998,1:04:13,Antoinette Meyer,lol@beancounters
1582276272747099,1:06:55,Antoinette Meyer,"examples, I can't recall, all was I order, no it was interpretation error... eish"
1582276370588425,1:08:31,Vuyisani Sikobi,"Obvious coverup, reflecting an interest as dividends when there were no dividends declared, red flag!"
1582276445156924,1:09:46,Antoinette Meyer,Vuyo you think someone is at least informing the judge on a c.
1582276529827655,1:11:11,Derrick Paul,"Dont be so surprised that the audit firms were corrupted, Remember the issue KPMG, that is a global accounting firm."
1582276588849415,1:12:10,Vuyisani Sikobi,"Do not think judge is advised on a/c issues, that dividend declared on the financial statements was covering up for falsifying a billion rand liability as equity in the Balance Sheet."
1582276654315492,1:13:16,Pravesh Gokul,Sars should do an lifestyle audit on Dudu and that will put her in jail sooner than later.
1582276715884334,1:14:17,EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,true I am layman. But appears to me that is going to be laid bare later. The guys leading are quite methodical.
1582277445754558,1:26:26,Dominic Przybylski,"""11 alarming charts that show the South African economy is in deep, deep trouble"" - article on news24. Very scary. Whole country is going exactly same way ESKOM has."
1582277699434310,1:30:41,Dominic Przybylski,We are going into governance(law and order) shedding.
1582277805260391,1:32:26,Dominic Przybylski,This is just fiddling while the country is on fire.
1582277855850800,1:33:18,Antoinette Meyer,"but Vuyi, may you, should send him a message. I also watched dudu in court yesterday."
1582277930571888,1:34:31,Mbuso Ndlovu,Zondo was born confused
1582278082182661,1:37:03,Mbuso Ndlovu,My father used to attend the same skool with Zondo. Zondo was not the fastest learnerüòÄüòÅüòÇ
1582278245813636,1:39:48,Anne M.,@Luvuyo Zantsi Mbuso is just trolling to get a reaction.
1582278265592744,1:40:07,EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,Do not discredit Zondo. No need. He is just chairing and directing the commission. Any one could chair that. Zondo asks for the general population to follow. He is cool. Respect.
1582278336301370,1:41:17,lordmore Karanda,This is what is needed in Zimbabwe now. All found to be corrupt must be jailed
1582278376494349,1:41:58,Mbuso Ndlovu,@lordmore Karanda Sorry we can't run Zimbabwe for you
1582278404953839,1:42:26,EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,Not called for

1582278543313411,1:44:45,D Thomas,"Hi all, Zondo is not a fool. What he was trying to establish was the sample size and materiality which the fellow does not seem to have much knowledge about"

1582278830446060,1:49:32,Anne M.,"With such a high number of irregular items, should they not have expanded their sample?"
1582278964250225,1:51:45,D Thomas,"Please note what is going on here. If 80% of a sample selection is deemed non compliant, then this guy should not be so casual"
1582279077004074,1:53:38,Makwa Choma,Anc is in charge
1582279135639441,1:54:36,clive oconnell,Bet they all got big Bonus as usual üí∞
1582279165180721,1:55:07,Anne M.,"DCJ, you are quite correct. You don't have to be an auditor to question why these irregularities went unreported."
1582279173394401,1:55:15,D Thomas,of cause they should have expanded the sample size and carried out substantive checks
1582279188969209,1:55:30,Anne M.,Agreed
1582279190620321,1:55:32,Vish Govender,This seems criminal. This person who is an auditor has an obligation to report criminal behaviour to the police. There is a practice in this country to give the real thieves a pass on criminality.
1582279248987495,1:56:30,Marcus Mmola,Can the judge seek clarity from witnesses not guide them on what they can say to justify shoddy work.
1582279369546621,1:58:30,MIKE DURBAN,@Marcus Mmola .......i say the same etc
1582279374527440,1:58:36,EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,Non compliance simple is their langauge to indicate serious irregularities which clearly in other words is stealing was rampant.
1582279409667106,1:59:11,EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,@Marcus spot on!
1582279412929453,1:59:14,Mvuyi Mpithi,"Problem with AG, is that they are very lazy and inconsistent in their audits, I once audited a municipality they had issued a clean audit report yet when I took over they shouldn't have done so..."
1582279417655685,1:59:19,clive oconnell,"All key words ie Workshops, clarity, irregularities all üêÇüí©"
1582279436831117,1:59:39,MIKE DURBAN,The DCJ Zondo.....does this very often etc...
1582279470309777,2:00:12,Mvuyi Mpithi,"Also IRBA is just a dog without teeth to bite, same as SAICA...cause if these were doing their work we wouldn't have had the state capture."
1582279548208296,2:01:30,Vish Govender,Police and NPA and govt depts in general steal public money because they can and worse still how there cover each other and we as the public are powerless. Honour among thieves and f# the people.
1582279632143713,2:02:53,Marcus Mmola,The PIC commission was combative but this one is too accommodating for toxic info.
1582279875972811,2:06:57,FieliesSA,Bring Mrs Hofmeyer back. She and Zondo has much better chemistry.
1582280223698705,2:12:45,FieliesSA,OOEEFFF! Bombshell!!
1582280273053760,2:13:34,Vish Govender,Miss Hofmeyer is a darling to listen to listen to. Havnt' admired anyone more. hollywood should recruit her. Loved to see her compassion when handling Mr X application for in camera hearing
1582280376492582,2:15:18,MIKE DURBAN,I realy think DCJ Zondo is great........but often he is just toooo accommodating.......
1582280390718644,2:15:32,Anne M.,"No, you're not being harsh DCJ. Alarm bells were ringing very loudly and for ""practical reasons"" nothing further was done?"
1582280526851073,2:17:48,EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,DCJ is sharp. Look he is proving his mettle!
1582280582886233,2:18:44,Anne M.,"@EDWARD ZVAVAREYI Yes, his calmness often brings out the truth because some people underestimate his intelligence."
1582280596865993,2:18:58,MIKE DURBAN,MAYBE....giving all of them rope.....to hang themselves etc......

1582280654495440,2:19:55,FieliesSA,"I also think Judge Zondo is the best candidate. He is slow, but its thorough slow. Closing any possible loopholes and clarifying possible ambiguities."
1582280766863171,2:21:48,Anele Sondlo,DCJ is really clear
1582280780030008,2:22:01,Vish Govender,"The ""mess"" is thieving and you did not report to the police? Then what can one say about you and your duty as an auditor."
1582280785737740,2:22:06,EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,Not really he is not giving these guys any rope. He is just helping so as to give a clearer picture!

1582281133526866,2:27:55,Maryann Diamond,there is no law and order in this country
1582281169331833,2:28:30,Vish Govender,yeah Mike don't hold your breath. Commissions in this country has been a TV Soap . No real accountability. Isidemeni is proof of that.
1582281212526839,2:29:14,MIKE DURBAN,@Maryann Diamond .....too true.......very sad indeed...

1582281440579968,2:33:01,Marcus Mmola,its true we are still waiting hopelessly for VBS circus to be resolved if any.
1582281543799001,2:34:45,MIKE DURBAN,If we could only get rid of the Commies/Socialists....what a great country this will be...
1582281586156745,2:35:27,FieliesSA,Its sad how the government is opposed to react on these for a better future. Yet they are so involved and implicated it makes sense they want to stay silent. And this as we put them in power
1582281622308628,2:36:04,EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,stop on
