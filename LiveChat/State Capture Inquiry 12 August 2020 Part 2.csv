1597238516079174,19:39,Tumi Masuku,if only they had better lies
1597238523284523,19:49,TW Ntshingila,TK which party would you recommend as a viable alternative to the ANC?
1597238685030879,22:30,Samuel Skosana,All parties become corrupt when in power. We should rather have a system where we vote for individuals instead of parties. Why don't we get rid of the party political system???
1597238782127047,24:06,Lennon Marks,coming in on the blind. it is not the voting but it is a case of educating the masses so that they can make the right choices

1597238933210585,26:36,Lennon Marks,corruption is not a case of education except maybe Zuma but it's a case of morals.

1597239325384236,33:09,L. M,@Canis Africanis your quote is unfounded as i have researched now. Do not fabricate. The ANC is in charge!
1597239339506769,33:25,Sekgololo Johannes,"Voting ANC, EFF and DA is to ask this wonderful state not to progress."
1597239360355642,33:45,Sekgololo Johannes,EFF is simply just young ANC.
1597239670649171,38:54,Koketso Tlhabi,I definitely would not vote for the DA. It is way too early to reinstate apartheid. The woulds are still fresh. I dont condone corruption and i believe ANC will sort this out and we move on.

1597240492176016,52:37,L. M,@Dominic Przybylski there you dont say about political ideology
1597240595910938,54:20,Dominic Przybylski,"An alternative is to reduce the reach of government into our personal life. It's an aim leading to a process, not an event. The problem is that people who imagine somebody else will solve their..."
1597240656371082,55:21,Dominic Przybylski,... problems have already conceded defeat. They lack self-esteem and those are the people who feed politicians.

1597241011225250,1:01:15,Dominic Przybylski,Thailand has had lowest unemployment anywhere in the world for decades. Why? Because they don't get any government support. They can look after themselves. It's called the land of smiles.
1597241174757829,1:03:58,L. M,in south-est asia the politicians are rife in leadership that run the life of people through their governments
1597241367060492,1:07:10,#dm70,A waste of taxpayers money as no-one will go to prison.
1597241418263748,1:08:01,Dominic Przybylski,They don't expect their government to do anything for them so the politicians have no power over them. When people believe politicians will do things for them is when they lose power.
