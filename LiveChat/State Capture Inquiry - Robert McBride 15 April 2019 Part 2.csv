1555330074917938,10:32,Albert Noah,Maybe we were expecting much more exposures from McBride

1555330173547683,12:11,Felix Muyoba,@carnoth ngomane 😂
1555330205280936,12:43,Lelatsa Raphula Daniel Khang,"Aaaarrrggghhh, this is now becoming monotonous"
1555330232244769,13:10,Felix Muyoba,@Lelatsa Raphula Daniel Khang true
1555330246112252,13:24,carnoth ngomane,@Felix Muyoba and here we are waiting for the name of 30 high profile implicated people
1555330261267368,13:39,Lorna Kavanagh,it appears the Judge and the Advocate are not happy about the answers they are getting as it does seems confusing
1555330290238998,14:08,Felix Muyoba,@Lorna Kavanagh you absolutely correct there
1555330293905756,14:12,ofhie Muofhe,steinhoff commission should be next
1555330329217746,14:47,Felix Muyoba,"@ofhie Muofhe esih, that is a monster on its own"
1555330363724152,15:21,Lorna Kavanagh,30 people ! but when will he get to that ? taken 3 days on the 2 reports.
1555330409410985,16:07,Sandile Lugogwana,This is the man I’ve been waiting for 😂
1555330411826475,16:10,carnoth ngomane,"@Lorna Kavanagh it will take forever,"
1555330465858517,17:03,ofhie Muofhe,@Felix Muyoba Thats where corruption is being hidden by the media
1555330471350370,17:09,Lelatsa Raphula Daniel Khang,"30high profile implicated?? On SABCRadio they've just said 50ppl. Guys, do u think we will get ""ARRESTS"" here or this is just a time wasting thing? Commission now becoming a useless and toothless dog?"
1555330475082129,17:13,Magda Seguin,"Ex Police Minister Nleko did the unthinkable...interfere with the independence of IPID,created false situations and employed Werksmans (a private law firm) to investigate IPID officials falsely"
1555330521417880,17:59,Lorna Kavanagh,i feels as though he is taking the Judge and Advocate down the garden path....
1555330551369052,18:29,carnoth ngomane,@ofhie Muofhe the media wont bite the hand the feeds it
1555330574350876,18:52,ofhie Muofhe,@Magda Seguin no one will report on the doggy work that Werksmans did
1555330673141542,20:31,ofhie Muofhe,@carnoth ngomane its a shame to see us believing what the media say as the fact and final truth without proper research
1555330695542370,20:53,Magda Seguin,"Werksmans were paid millions ...when Mc Bride went to the parlamentary police committee it ended when McBride,Dramat and Sibya went tou constitutional court who cleared them."
1555330753538570,21:51,carnoth ngomane,@ofhie Muofhe you are correct the media cant be trusted
1555330834394169,23:12,ofhie Muofhe,@Magda Seguin Why are we not being informed about those millions now.
1555330835739719,23:13,Magda Seguin,Werkmans sent two emails that Mr Pretorious showed this morning trying again to implicate McBride but the content was rebutted by him...they must becreported to the Bar
1555330900141148,24:18,Lorna Kavanagh,.... i know that i am confused. i have fallen asleep many times
1555330940997070,24:58,Magda Seguin,"They conspired to get rid of all three,Mc Bride,Dramat and Sibaya....on false charges which was also thrown out by the court..."
1555331023005057,26:21,Lorna Kavanagh,..but why so long to get clarity on the reports.
1555331049938034,26:47,ofhie Muofhe,They should payback the money coz they did a bad job
1555331135405364,28:13,Magda Seguin,When Cele did not want to extend McBrides contract he wrote a letter to parliament that heaviky implicated McBride that is why they voted incfavour of getting rid of him.
1555331246503140,30:04,ofhie Muofhe,Why is ENCA not covering the McBride testimony?
1555331267705529,30:25,Magda Seguin,@Lorna...for absolute clarity
1555331439136198,33:17,Magda Seguin,There was never a 'rendition' the constitional court found it false
1555331536791131,34:54,Lorna Kavanagh,Now why was is it called 'Rendition' ?
1555331574472368,35:32,Magda Seguin,@ofhie...amaghunbane and daily maverick has done lots of investigative work...I th
1555331653506709,36:51,ofhie Muofhe,@Magda Seguin on what
1555331724257213,38:02,Magda Seguin,Rendition is a term that describes persons are rendered to another country...McBride and co was accused by the minister to have kidnapped and rendered people wanted by Zimbabwe
1555331751663122,38:29,Lorna Kavanagh,thank you Magda.
1555331829174551,39:47,ofhie Muofhe,@Magda Seguin your Lawyerish neh
1555331925824142,41:23,Magda Seguin,Everything is in the public domain.Some political parties accuse investigative journalists to be stratcom thereby informing people not to believe the press so that they stay uninformed
1555331966046306,42:04,Magda Seguin,"I am not a lawyer,just a concerned citizen"
1555332005990106,42:44,Kgafela Setae,is it just who is tired of this report run around.
1555332032413148,43:10,Lorna Kavanagh,.... is The advocate getting to the nitty gritty.
1555332050709957,43:28,phumudzo magidi,"I've just tuned in now. Mc Bride looks like a lier. I've not heard what he is saying but eeish, HD looks untrustworthy. that's just my prejudice side 😂😂🙈🙈"
1555332087930787,44:06,Magda Seguin,The Judge has to have ALL the details for his final report and recommendations to the president.
1555332104492600,44:22,ofhie Muofhe,''investigative journalist'' does that mean they write facts and truthful information. coz thats my concern.
1555332201519848,45:59,Magda Seguin,@phumudzo just looking at a person and deciding he is a liar?You must be able to read minds.The comments here always amazes me how judgemental South Africans are
1555332315251008,47:53,Magda Seguin,@ofhie absolute proof and evidence is checked before writing ANY article.It is only fake news that goes under the radar but there is a way to detect fake news instantly
1555332323885490,48:01,omar suleman,​@phumudzo how did you conclude that McBride is a Liar
1555332403482716,49:21,Magda Seguin,Ace says he will sue the author of Gangster State but the author has all the evidence...he has lawyers that checked all the facts so if Ace sues all the proof will come out in court
1555332426181220,49:44,ofhie Muofhe,but to predict a fact is a false assumption of the truth
1555332439662473,49:57,Sthakathi Khumalo,Where are we vele vele?? Just tuned in and Zondo is posing in many funny lost ways!!
1555332441652336,49:59,phumudzo magidi,I don't know. hence my confession of prejudice. pi would make a bad judge. I look at you once and decide if you are a sgebengu or not.
1555332470370508,50:28,ofhie Muofhe,@ Why didnt he put those evidence in front of a judge
1555332538349142,51:36,Derek Main,@phumudzo magidi Tell us what you see when you look at Ace Magashule. That should show us how accurate your decisions are.
1555332548270646,51:46,Magda Seguin,There is NO predictions...ONLY facts as per investigations and whistleblower testimony that is why journalists will never and can never be forced to name their sources
1555332555292913,51:53,carnoth ngomane,pretorius always reserve matters for later
1555332557337056,51:55,phumudzo magidi,I see a tsotsi
1555332565448639,52:03,ofhie Muofhe,"@Magda Seguin my problem is when you say people have evidence, but they dont open a case"
1555332569397796,52:07,Anne M.,@ofhie Muofhe Adv Pretorius showed a slide on the 1st day of McBride's testimony;. On it was the number of cases sent to the NPA and the NPA didn't prosecute any.
1555332620026513,52:57,Magda Seguin,@phumudzo...you will get into serious trouble labelling people without evidence
1555332634088391,53:12,carnoth ngomane,"@phumudzo magidi are there any elements of a tsotsi in him or his testimony, if so elaborate"
1555332650223913,53:28,ofhie Muofhe,@Anne M. am referring to evidence from journalist
1555332656725994,53:34,phumudzo magidi,@Derek Main i see a tsotsi when it comes to that one
1555332672034852,53:50,Anne M.,@ofhie Muofhe Okay
1555332703815496,54:21,Magda Seguin,Nowhere in the world is it a journalists duty to open cases they are there to provide information in public nterest
1555332717659169,54:35,funicanz,"@Magda Seguin , we will just block @phumudzo magidi if there's not evidence on that label."
1555332721119846,54:39,ofhie Muofhe,@Anne M. that shows that the NPA was 100% captured
1555332758451915,55:16,Magda Seguin,During Zuma's tenure it is now public knowledge that SAPS was also captured
1555332760944377,55:19,phumudzo magidi,@Canon I don't even listen to evidence. I just judge from the looks
1555332806998197,56:05,carnoth ngomane,@phumudzo magidi looks can be deceiving
1555332841959036,56:39,ofhie Muofhe,But is it a duty of a journalist to label a person as corrupt without any legal stand
1555332906442506,57:44,Lorna Kavanagh,Zondo must remain as the Chair person...
1555332914822607,57:52,Sthakathi Khumalo,Is he talking about his bro now? and conflict of intrest
1555332931202351,58:09,Magda Seguin,The teacher in me always want to educate but since I dont lecture anymore I should just give it up
1555332954691580,58:32,Lee D. Hendrix,"...as a Constitutional requirement, X ordered a Commissioned Officer of the Courts( zondo) to Constitutionally investigate evident breaches of the integrity of National Security of the SA Gov. ICU..."

1555332966373545,58:44,Magda Seguin,ofhie is a troll
1555332998382988,59:16,phumudzo magidi,I could spot a thug from a distance at bree street when I was still young. never got mugged all my life because I can see a nafarious person. I'm talking rubbish but Mcbride just looks like mashaya

1555333383217416,1:05:41,Sthakathi Khumalo,"ofhie Muofhe If people do not want to accept your point of view, they cast you as a troll!!"
1555333493251975,1:07:31,Magda Seguin,I amazed at the ignorance of some people...especially those that are previously priviledged....those that benefited from apartheid
1555333510851397,1:07:48,Derek Main,@phumudzo magidi Excellent! Seems like your radar is working.
1555333528839484,1:08:06,Magda Seguin,And are still benefiting

1555334226504865,1:19:44,Derek Main,@Cerebis Yes - I've heard about it. Also think they should be free to be self-governed.
1555334345533618,1:21:43,Magda Seguin,Catalonia is still part of Spain (inside Spanish borders)
1555334426758668,1:23:04,Cerebis,"Catalonia was an independent region of the Iberian Peninsula – modern day Spain and Portugal – with its own language, laws and customs"
1555334459282196,1:23:37,Cerebis,"Subsequent kings tried to impose the Spanish language and laws on the region, but they abandoned their attempts in 1931 and restored the Generalitat"
1555334514633452,1:24:32,Magda Seguin,"@Cerebis I know,I went to Spain snd travelled around,I even spent timebin Andorre"
1555334584901940,1:25:43,Magda Seguin,Andorre is situated between France and Spain...its a tax haven

1555335738335746,1:44:56,Magda Seguin,I saw on Twitter state capture handle it was Mr Khuba and Mr Seseko on the phone
1555335946153979,1:48:24,Magda Seguin,"I typed 'state capture' in the twitter search bar and came across their account,I was not even aware they had a Twitter account!..started following"
1555336028009154,1:49:46,Madelein R,I follow State Capture on Twitter. It help when I get confused 🤣🤣
1555336029083299,1:49:47,makhosi nobhatyi,"Pretorious was right to argue about next evidence that will come after McBride, it will be his younger brother, there is a lot of perception around his brother, that judge must be excused"
1555336125712953,1:51:23,Wildthing,looks liJoe its getting hot in the kitchen
1555336161829615,1:52:00,Magda Seguin,"@Madelein most of my reading depends in actual authentic documentation,I am active on Twitter but in my academic capacity."
1555336300147666,1:54:18,Madelein R,"I not active, but a follower."
1555336667609275,2:00:25,Fils de l'homme,@Eslon Eslon who's younger brother is implicated?
1555336682115567,2:00:40,Magda Seguin,@makhosi the next witness is General Booysen of KZN...he was set up in the so called Cato Manor debacle that the Sunday Times published....all turned out to be false
1555336695785015,2:00:53,Lorna Kavanagh,Zondo younger brother whois an advocate
1555336718108668,2:01:16,Fils de l'homme,"@Lorna Kavanagh hahaha, what did his brother do?"
1555336750701759,2:01:48,Fils de l'homme,or rather what is he alledged to be implicated in?
1555336750750644,2:01:48,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Magda Seguin thank you Jeffrou
1555336772698160,2:02:10,Magda Seguin,@makhosi 🤣
1555336824119845,2:03:01,Lorna Kavanagh,it will be a travesty if DCJ Zondo is recused...
1555336891516726,2:04:09,Magda Seguin,Judge Zondo's brother chaired McBrides disciplinary before he was suspended..Mr Pretorious read out that he does not want to testify or cross examine McBride
1555336928341771,2:04:46,Eslon Eslon,@Fils de I'home.. DCJ Zondo younger brother chaired an inquiry that was set up to victimize Mcbride for doing his job
1555337005625218,2:06:03,Fils de l'homme,@Eslon Eslon so this commission now runs the risk of being discredited
