1565684285503548,42:40,Kabelo Katjedi,"Every council will be defending his or her client,Zuma's lawyers gave everyone a weapon to avoid being cross examined.This commission shouldn't allow this advocates 2 turn this commission into court"
1565684355511748,43:49,Isaac Ncube,"Makhosi Nobhatyi, not at all Jiba is not an invesigator but Prosecutor. I see your comment is clouded by your deep rooted hatred of the Guptas"
1565684427907377,45:02,Esther Vetuu Katjiuongua-Kamberipa,"@ Kabelo Katjedi, But is that legally possible? or rather permitable?"
1565684610782111,48:05,Abe Molefe,will be like zim soon cause no 1 payback looted money or sentenced
1565684648705838,48:43,Kabelo Katjedi,Esther im just worried abt the manner in which Zondo allows this councils trying 2 channel him on what 2 do.Some might feel that their client shouldn't b cross examined even though he must force them2
1565684752788123,50:27,Look at My roblox account,what is thisssss
1565684835343946,51:50,Kabelo Katjedi,"once you force them to give evidence u myt come across the answers like i do not recall,this commission its a joke since well high profile individuals with huge pockets give evidence against 1another"
