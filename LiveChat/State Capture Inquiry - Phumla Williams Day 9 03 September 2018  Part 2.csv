1535966581609459,14:55,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@hilton modike Hawks are still trying to entangle themselves from state capture. They were deep in the state capture ditch as well.
1535966670973231,16:25,mfumo walter maluleke,what is this issue about vincent smith. Please fill me in
1535966714682574,17:08,hilton modike,@keith sindile dinabantu i have a feeling that zuma was right when he said he will expose most of the politicians who stole so much .its will take 10 years 4 the Anc 2 clean itself
1535966717893072,17:10,Marvel Mushavhela,"Are there any high profile cases that Hawks persued, charge and win exept being corrupt?"
1535966775309474,18:09,fernando visagie,"Just one question , will the spin doctor Jimmy be summoned to appear before the commission and also charged with interfering with witnesses?"
1535966855290261,19:28,hilton modike,@mfumo Maluleke nwana mhani there was a corrupt tender given to bosasa at the airport and they were paying vincent smith R670000.00 & they did his security upgrade @his home 4 free .at a cost of k200
1535967049843169,22:44,Francois Cape Town,"They should also ask Cyril Ramaphosa what he knew about state capture, and why he didn't do anything about it. It was in the news for years and years."
1535967121568030,23:55,hilton modike,the guptas were real mafias the story that they employed fikile mbalula to b a sports miniter came up again on weekend .i guess made it a point that they put dirts on all the ministers
1535967169398439,24:43,Floyd Nkuna,The position was vacant for 6 years cause the Guptas were still looking for a stooge.
1535967255030565,26:09,Amanda Watson,"What happened was the always accessible, friendly, and professional Phumla was no longer accessible to journalists."
1535967297957618,26:51,hilton modike,cyril ramaphosa have got a women to work with i c a courageous women like thuli madonsela in her .this women was bullied so much & never succumbed
1535967398485316,28:32,hilton modike,@amanda watson i guess there was a way that she could be accessible with all this pressure on her .because i guess she feared that she have to explain things in a way they wanted her to
1535967520448863,30:34,hilton modike,the manner in which she was treated by faith muthambi as a women is embarassing . i cant believe that some women help men to perpetuate patriarchy against womens

1535968067948992,39:42,Phineas Motaung,I don't say they must be sent to jail but this evidence should be running parallel with evidence before a judge.
1535968128026436,40:42,Phineas Motaung,Remember this evidence is evidence before court yet.
1535968173120254,41:26,Madluphuthu,"I said it on Friday and I'm going to say it again, I sense a lot of anger from Ms. Williams due to the manner in which she was treated. Therefore, I would take her averments with a pinch of salt."

1535968242885166,42:36,Nicky majiya,I like Me Williams
1535968254180452,42:48,Phineas Motaung,Gupta leaks were enough prima facie evidence and readonable prospects of prosecution.

1535968350869977,44:25,Phineas Motaung,did anyone implicated deny authenticity of allegations

1535968436341379,45:50,Phineas Motaung,the only denial was that Saxonwold could have been a shebeen
1535968523441761,47:17,Nicky majiya,Is she still there at GCIS ?
1535968535725479,47:29,J Ganasan,"the lawyer is so cute. if she was questioning me, i'll tell her everything"
1535968556916856,47:50,Phineas Motaung,No Thando Hawks is the investigating unit not the commission
1535968593360184,48:27,Jp Mubita,@J Ganasan I'm sure you would.....lol
1535968631652404,49:04,J Ganasan,so you were sidelined from your position os DDG - maybe were incompetent
1535968714352660,50:28,hilton modike,@j ganasan .i guess it was fair to let her remain on her position if she was not comperent.the fact that she was acting for this long it tells that she is competent.
1535968753209041,51:07,hilton modike,@j ganasan i thought u could c between the lines that she was treated unfairly.
1535968802582489,51:56,J Ganasan,if she was incompetent - then the minister and DG did the right thing
1535968821663156,52:15,hilton modike,@j ganasan .i think u would have felt much bitter if it wad u .because what was happening to her was unfair .and she was bullied by ur brothers atul's puppets

1535968986392235,55:00,Madluphuthu,"She loves her power and positions shame. it seems to me that had they given her the nice promotions, she would not be here testifying. She is settling old scores this one."

1535969144443816,57:38,Philani ngcobo,Lawyers for the defense will use her anger to ridicule her testimony.
1535969186028284,58:20,J Ganasan,hilton - stop making false accusations. Gupta and Zuma shd be behind bars. But this obese lady should get real

1535969354630399,1:01:08,Maimane H. L. Lekwane,Some comments from the likes of J Ganasan are just pure immoral
1535969359219026,1:01:13,Siphiwe Booi,The State capture did not only damage the Government's monies but it actually emotionally abused our Mothers. It breaks my heart seeing Ms Williams holding back her tears.
1535969361397340,1:01:15,Philani ngcobo,Herman he is highly professional is his job.
1535969379583891,1:01:33,Madluphuthu,Funny how many people here are now assuming that she was a victim just because she says so.
1535969384219388,1:01:37,Maimane H. L. Lekwane,"Yes, he is Philani."

1535969602623135,1:05:16,Madluphuthu,why should we just take her word for it? these allegations still need to be tested.
1535969754809554,1:07:48,Madluphuthu,@Philani ngcobo it just shows you how easily people are persuaded. Just shed a few tears and you'll have them eating out of the palm of your hand.
