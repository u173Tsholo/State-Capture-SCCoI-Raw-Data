1561623946072635,22:12,Born free,Yes he has a very arrogant opinion of himself.. I think he is preparing to set his senior officials up to take the heat off himself.

1561624291246281,27:56,Norman Zwane,@Jayden Bango @funicanz @Abel Matshidiso Justice Jafta just delivered the judgement.
1561624316489753,28:22,Born free,Jiba and Mrwebi remain on the Roll of Advocates. What a disgrace.. thanks to Ramaphosa.
1561624364518024,29:10,Kevin Simon,Notice the body language. Says yes while shaking his head. Did not want to concede the point.
1561624368883904,29:15,Jabulile Mazwane,what did Ramaphosa do now
1561624376425985,29:23,Thami Ngwenya,"What Ramaphosa to do with courts,"

1561624451101385,30:37,Khwesta Mdliva,ramaphosa is not a judge he is a president of the country
1561624456629915,30:43,Victor,How is Mahlangu doing?
1561624458358432,30:45,Jayden Bango,zondo really enjoying his work today compared to the past two days
1561624490209938,31:16,Norman Zwane,@Born free Our judiciary stands tall by ensuring it is independent from the executive and make its well reasoned decisions. I have no idea what you think CR is - he is the president not the judge too.
1561624492468475,31:18,Jayden Bango,@Victor nothing material so far just the blah blah the guy seems jittery
1561624503266272,31:29,Thami Ngwenya,"cele are y joining the sick, love yourself"
1561624508521714,31:34,Khwesta Mdliva,the guy looks uncomfortable
1561624509928808,31:35,makhosi nobhatyi,@Born free they out of the NPA fired but they can be advocates not inside government they can open their firm
1561624514265566,31:40,Victor,@Jayden Bango He is feeling guilty?
1561624518909493,31:45,Born free,Ramaphosa dismissed the corrupt two but failed to say they should be removed from the Roll of Advocates. We will have to wait for Judge Zondo to make this finding against Jiba.
1561624531704996,31:58,Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,cele did he agree that the money come to him
1561624550522048,32:16,Victor,"Its early stages, let him relax because we will get to details"
1561624575504426,32:41,Jayden Bango,@Victor they havent started really proding. he is explaining his work experience with reletive difficulty
1561624581969468,32:48,Khwesta Mdliva,hai maan ramaphosa can not say nor do that he only appoints or dismisses as he correctly did so
1561624582770966,32:49,watson mutanga,The witness comes across as being passively aggressive.
1561624588143698,32:54,Victor,Is he the SAA Mahlangu issue?
1561624620655890,33:26,Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,yesterday
1561624653612231,34:00,Born free,Haha speed it up
1561624665288634,34:11,Jayden Bango,"@Victor No, the SAA was advisor to gigaba if i am not mistaken. this one is BNP capital"
1561624667417153,34:13,Thami Ngwenya,Mahlangu?
1561624677499601,34:24,Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,is 400m or 500000
1561624688685299,34:35,Norman Zwane,@Born free Its not my job to educate you but per our constitution t is not for CR to make that decision. Maybe you judst think this is some place were a President is the Lord of all. He is not.
1561624707982844,34:55,makhosi nobhatyi,"We are happy Jiba and mrwebi out of NPA , they can work elsewhere independently"
1561624740909302,35:27,Thami Ngwenya,"Verwoerd was the Lord of all, hence today we remember the Cradock 4"
1561624772121190,35:58,Jayden Bango,"@makhosi nobhatyi correct, we dont care about the judgement. as long as they are not corrupting our justice system"
1561624787970718,36:14,carnoth ngomane,"@Norman Zwane at may not be your duty to educate them but if needs be do it brother, clearly they are in the dark"
1561624795522620,36:21,Born free,They are in breach of the Oath of advocates and should not be allowed to practise privately.. they are a disgrace.
1561624827972168,36:54,Jayden Bango,he is all over the show...not very bright as thought
1561624843156227,37:09,Danie Nilsen,what is this about mlugisi it sounds like race comment if it is i d not think it is on topic please advise
1561624856974027,37:23,Kevin Simon,Hofmeyer knows these answers. Wants to just show he is all bluster.
1561624867069797,37:33,funicanz,Eish this witness is starting to annoy me. He is all over
1561624882802117,37:49,Tich Ziny,"@Jayden Bango, my point exactly. busy shopping around"
1561624905885271,38:12,Some guy,hi Everyone. when is Zuma appearing here? so we can finish this commission and arrest him
1561624920277814,38:26,makhosi nobhatyi,"Let me correct something here Ramaphosa did want to strike of advocates the both two, he used was they are not fit to hold office, they were fired by president which is still remain"

1561624961792284,39:08,Some guy,cant wait. this commission needs to end and he must go to prison. Its taking too long
1561624975251190,39:21,clive oconnell,Advocates can work for KPMG
1561624988036380,39:34,cassim suleman,not so easy to arrest..as legal procedures. take 10 years.
1561624991026077,39:36,roberto wilco,I would say the only people who will be arrested are the whistleblowers
1561624991240568,39:37,Some guy,well someone has to be arrested. and its pointing to him
1561625033187018,40:19,Thulani Bukani,Judge is having a better day today
1561625041865423,40:28,cassim suleman,he is so ill prepared..wat was he doing before he came to comm

1561625059823108,40:46,Some guy,lol i just want action. weve heard enough stories now
1561625081933151,41:09,Danie Nilsen,why is this state capture so surprizing to some people this is how africa functions it is actualy busness as usual
1561625102926440,41:29,cassim suleman,going to take looong time to arrest zuma
1561625106719557,41:33,Jabulile Mazwane,yes Judge
1561625119680918,41:46,Some guy,"if we dont arrest, these stories will go on forever....just another delay tactic for him....YET again"
1561625129667238,41:55,Danie Nilsen,even the police chief looks like a mafie boss
1561625140084770,42:06,Some guy,then in the end he will say he was prejudiced and therefore the case is unfair
1561625142996759,42:09,makhosi nobhatyi,@Norman Zwane yes they will be fired definitely because they were blocking ways of justice zuptas won’t do that constitutional court didn’t change anything from being unfit to hold office stayed
1561625176466035,42:43,Norman Zwane,"@clive oconnell KPMG, Arthur Anderson, De Loitte all blue chip audit houses are so deep into corruption and have consistently given our munipalicities clean external audits. Turns out they lied!!"
1561625177288080,42:44,Kevin Simon,This is looking more and more like chronological inexactitudes of others' experience.
1561625185600292,42:52,cassim suleman,npa and hawks havent kicked off yet..battling to find honest prosecutors and cops..needle in haystack

1561625320321718,45:06,Norman Zwane,"@makhosi nobhatyi I'm informed not by the politics of the country which would support dismissal, but the factional politics of the ANC is contrary as it seeks to embarass CR."
1561625349078599,45:35,cassim suleman,judge has to be friendly as this is a commission.people are invited to assist..
1561625377003613,46:03,Wilson Hishono,shes the type of gerie nel

1561625830290233,53:36,Zama Kubheka,People have been eating money left right and centre.
1561625856741331,54:03,Jayden Bango,@cassim suleman the tranches of evidence (1&2) are particularly directed towards allegations emanating from the aviation sector. if banks colluded they will be handled separately
1561625891766041,54:38,Kevin Simon,This is going to be about another hijacked BBEEE company.
1561625951225260,55:37,Kevin Simon,So we have not yet established their (his) experience prior to the SAA funding deal.
1561625981698021,56:08,Edwin Arthur,this chap is going like a bullet train
