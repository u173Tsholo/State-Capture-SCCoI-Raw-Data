1581942256144092,15:25,Anne M.,DCJ is making very sure that all the t's are crossed and the i's dotted. Nobody wants anything from the commission to be thrown out of court.
1581942272244462,15:41,Cedric Man Yan,Checkers don't run to the public for bail-outs.
1581942285766256,15:55,Margareth Waterboer,@Deric Main...mention Dudu Mnyeni and Zumba comes to mind...and vice versa
1581942319721353,16:29,Person of interest,"@Mbuso, DCJ Zondo not lazy, not a bit."

1581942532395568,20:02,Norma Day,"anne me too, a man who came from humble beginnings and still has integrity and respect fir all who appears before him"
1581942548840814,20:18,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Anne M. Wait until you appear before him because of corruption charges or state capture
1581942558294234,20:27,Anne M.,"@Norma Day Yes, agree."

1581943171638626,30:40,Elvis Malakoane,The problem is that people secrifice and risk their all to reveal corruption but NPA and the HAWKS play no role to assist or arrest just one excuse after the other
1581943218108994,31:27,Derek Main,@Elvis Malakoane Yes - that is the bottleneck at the moment. And the criminals keep on plundering in the meanwhile.
1581943226557521,31:35,Colleen Arezio,Elvis you hit the nail on the head there.
1581943348114686,33:37,Pheladi Lamola,Judge never misses an opportunity to teach🤣🤣

1581943508205125,36:17,FieliesSA,Thats bad... So we know his company and we know he is the owner. There goes the anonymity...
1581943546302874,36:55,Mbuso Ndlovu,@Derek Main We are entitled to our opinions
1581943569053921,37:17,Colleen Arezio,anonymity is out the window now.

1581943684934748,39:14,Margareth Waterboer,@FieliesSA I’m always nervous with anonymity and a slip that might occur...
1581943763146459,40:33,Derek Main,@Mbuso Ndlovu Of course we are - just trying to understand where you're coming from. Would you be critical no matter what?
1581943859027337,42:07,Thamsanqa Nomayela,Mam Dudu know him right now.
1581943868263502,42:16,Thabani Mkhatshwa,the culprit for the disclosure of the cc is the Commission itself. Oversight or Incompetence. I leave it to you
1581943944740287,43:33,Gareth Hellyar,Dudu knew he was coming here today. Called his daughter last night.
1581943952311231,43:41,Margareth Waterboer,"@Person of Interest...she worked on this witness over the weekend too.. They work very hard behind the scenes...long hours... We only see them during these sessions, but they work constantly..."

1581944137855834,46:46,Person of interest,Sounded like this witness daughter might have felt threatened and he reported the call to the commission?
1581944140714704,46:48,Geraldine Lange,lucky only one side off

1581944332431746,50:01,Sthakathi Khumalo,Only Gideon Niewoudt was termed as Mr Ex in TRC hehe
1581944338314781,50:07,Anne M.,"@Dominic Przybylski He wants to remain anonymous to the broader community. He knows the Myenis know who he is, he daughter received a phone call from Dudu"
1581944343874290,50:12,Gareth Hellyar,Do you know who he is @Dominic Przybylski ?
1581944366293479,50:35,Derek Main,@Diss & Dad I think it should continue indefinitely - until all the criminals are behind bars. Exposes corruption and acts as deterrent.
1581944370766986,50:39,spasticmonkey78,@Diss & Dad This will drag on for years unfortunately
1581944382522024,50:52,Dominic Przybylski,"@Gareth Hellyar No, but anybody who knows him will know."
1581944388434915,50:57,Margareth Waterboer,"@Fana, I don’t think anyone is disrespecting the interpreter.They merely created a light moment.. I for example hate criticism of people’s appearances but this was a funny comment without disrespect."
1581944434903538,51:44,Gareth Hellyar,They knew he was coming here today anyway.
1581944441666141,51:50,Dominic Przybylski,@Gareth Hellyar and those people will make sure everybody else does.
1581944480186881,52:28,Derek Main,@Diss & Dad I don't think he has yet but I think he should be given one.
1581944503254478,52:52,Thabelo Emmanuel,we want to see X why he dont want us to see him coz his lying
1581944524490103,53:13,Sthakathi Khumalo,Interpreter - haai anginawo amaningi..
1581944569919868,53:59,Derek Main,@Diss & Dad I would like to see a permanent forum where the criminals can be grilled and shamed on national tv. Hopefully that'll put them off.
1581944582748004,54:11,fuzile dazana,heebana is this a best interpret in south africa we can get just asking

1581944688449350,55:57,Sibusiso Mthokozisi Dubazana,"@Thabelo Emmanuel, just because he chose to remain anonymous to the broader society he is lying? It has been made clear that Dudu Myeni did infact call Mr X daughter to ask why he is selling them out"
1581944711780843,56:21,Sthakathi Khumalo,Interpreter naye akekho sure - its gonna be a long one hehe
1581944714484121,56:24,Dominic Przybylski,I've just seen latest BEE proposal for ICT companies. If they don't give 30% of their company to black owners they can be fined up to R5million or get jail sentence of up to 2 years.

1581945002542265,1:01:11,Derek Main,@Diss & Dad I reckon he has assistance to manage it all. I'm sure he sits down after each session and organises the info. A mammoth task but not impossible.
1581945003653587,1:01:12,FieliesSA,@fuzile dazana Yoh man wrong stream. This here is state capture... Start that nonsense somewhere else. Chat is in agreement here
