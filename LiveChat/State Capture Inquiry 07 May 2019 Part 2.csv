1557233214513170,45:22,Kapn Krunch,the way the DA is seen is a result of the only way the ANC gets votes by making everything black and white
1557233238257071,45:45,Magda Seguin,"@Douglas Beadle you are right,it is very painful"
1557233238435062,45:45,Mzalwane Mzala,IRR which is led by pro DA liberals places the DA at 21.8%

1557233607054877,51:54,Mzalwane Mzala,What i can not argue against is that the EFF is likely to govern the City of Tshwane after these elections and the DA have acknowledged that by placing the current mayor on their provincial list.
1557233659453461,52:46,Mzalwane Mzala,I will not be shocked if they bring Floyd to be the mayor.
1557233692189139,53:19,Born free,There is no brain matter in the EFF just simple minded thugs.
