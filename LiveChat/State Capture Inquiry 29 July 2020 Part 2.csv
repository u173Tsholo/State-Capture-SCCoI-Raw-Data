1596024318688963,31:47,R hunter,...has he done a breath test yet? Think he is on planet 'papsak'!

1596024704203589,38:13,Sammy Mashamba,"'An Investigative Report is not based on views,' Nhleko. PATHETIC😳😳😳😳😳😳😳"

1596025774477043,56:03,Leon Mbangwa,Can't believe that so much time is being wasted to protect wrong doing. Why would someone who was not involved in investigation have interest in changing a report

1596025929121155,58:37,Dominic Przybylski,Zondo definitely seems to be blocking Hulley at critical moments in his questioning.
1596025932113031,58:41,Leon Mbangwa,McBride was employed three or more years after the crime had been committed. He surely had nothing to do with the investigation. He should have stayed away and allow legal processes to unroll
1596025950805969,58:59,Sebastian MoAfrika,Harley came with an agenda
1596025957436824,59:06,Godfrey Mama,Remember Nkandla report was challenged by Adv Madonsela and dismiss by Concourt

1596025987575437,59:36,Leon Mbangwa,Former Minister Nhleko is on top of this and this shall end badly for the new Director of Foreign Intelligence.
1596025988865593,59:37,Sebastian MoAfrika,the authority he has because he is a minister
1596025994469367,59:42,Dominic Przybylski,@Godfrey Mama Eh?
1596026018676027,1:00:07,Saki Louw,Why is the judge putting words in the mouth of the witness? He should let the witness answer the question and allow him to contradict himself if he is not telling the truth.
1596026028052253,1:00:17,Chef Brown,this is the minister who brought us the fire poooool remember

1596026137981393,1:02:08,Saki Louw,How many more of Ministers of Police are going to be guilty of misconduct. It's shameful.
1596026167350101,1:02:36,Bruce Thackwell,Oh yes even when you are guilty you are not guilty.... what a low life
1596026202905669,1:03:10,Antoinette Meyer,uncleRay should insist in respect

1596026281223276,1:04:30,Singi Mathebula,this arrogant guy wasted time.
1596026284970336,1:04:34,Mohamed Mia,Dcj also waffles too much
1596026290950791,1:04:40,Antoinette Meyer,"uncle Ray, you are interrupting"
1596026309744709,1:04:59,Mr Green,Adv is also beating about the bush...

1596027906064585,1:29:48,Sebastian MoAfrika,the real state capturers are being exposed.
1596028020732485,1:31:44,Dominic Przybylski,Karma catches all. Al Bashir now jailed in his own country.
1596028038388355,1:32:01,Tommygun,"Talking about situations and consequences that arose from the trumped up charges. Disjuncture, bull*&(*t"
1596028122659903,1:33:26,mandisi ntauzana,"@Redeemar you are lying, the court in which Adv Mokhari SC represented the state, the order by Fabricius J was that the state will not allow Al Bashir to leave but when order came he had left already"
1596028158675612,1:34:01,Sebastian MoAfrika,advocate mkhari black excellence
1596028276402602,1:35:59,Tommygun,A real Devils Advocate...

1596028350270727,1:37:13,Sebastian MoAfrika,mkhari is exposing Hulley's agenda
1596028359670829,1:37:22,Earnest Munyoro,why should Zondo interject
1596028423323234,1:38:25,dennis oldude,Seems that suddenly we are not in any hurry. Parliament must now act against a sitting minister - in what circus will this happen - not in cloud cuckoo land
1596028453145023,1:38:56,Roy Kisten,there we again about goats
1596028465360968,1:39:07,David Mageva Makhuvele,Mkhari poking holes on Hulley
1596028488483467,1:39:31,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,Judges don't easily intervene in re-examination.

1596028535868385,1:40:18,funicanz,"@Luvuyo Zantsi , shlobo molo"
1596028554313015,1:40:37,Tommygun,Is all this todo about those excisions from the 2 reports? All charges and might of the law directed to that?
1596028565874522,1:40:48,Roy Kisten,this guy will go Scot free
1596028569823305,1:40:52,Tommygun,or differences....
1596028575940825,1:40:58,Sebastian MoAfrika,but it's not Nhleko's fault that the IPID Act was unconstitutional
1596028587982314,1:41:11,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,Molo @funicanz unjani?
1596028604969056,1:41:27,Mandy Phillips,May Zondo be granted the WISDOM to make the right decision after this finishes.
1596028626883412,1:41:49,funicanz,"@Luvuyo Zantsi , ndiGrand. Mehlo'madala. 😃"
1596028678951141,1:42:42,dennis oldude,no just picking up on the letter of the law while he was protecting his appointer - the right honorable and honest President Zuma
1596028706027607,1:43:09,Siyabulela Gaju,Mr Zondo needs Wisdom and guidance from the lord🙌
1596028719973567,1:43:23,Sebastian MoAfrika,he acted within the law and it was later found the law is unlawful hence parliament to amend the legislation accordingly
1596028751547595,1:43:54,Inspiration Afri,you shouldn't feel embarrassed when the court says you've acted unlawfully!!!
1596028812363275,1:44:55,Earnest Munyoro,you should not because you have acted according to the law but the law was drafted wrongly and unconstitutional and that's not you fault
1596028854200135,1:45:37,dennis oldude,No wonder he can't find a job - taking responsibility is not in his DNA - he just wants authority to spend other peoples money while he alludes to all sorts of imaginary enemies
1596028857489824,1:45:41,HALO,We need these politicians to be put in their place but too many south africans are brainwashed to support corrupted politicians
1596028858826814,1:45:42,Earnest Munyoro,the the role of the superior court to guide people into the correct interpretation
1596028931403954,1:46:54,Sebastian MoAfrika,Apartheid was morally wrong and legal domestically bcos of legislation hence many never saw the inside of jail. it was the democratic government that dealt with apartheid perpetrators @Redeemed
1596028933781880,1:46:56,dennis oldude,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ - boring repetition ZZZZZZZZ
1596028949075087,1:47:12,HALO,There are criminals in parliament and you anc supporters are responsible for that

1596029039073908,1:48:42,Tommygun,"I presume all watching this and hearing his answers know in their hearts that Nhleko is lying, evasive and desperatly trying to look clean despite his utterly mystifying descisions."
1596029064155405,1:49:06,dennis oldude,We should be running a trial and putting these idiot in jail - the truth should then set them free - when they find out what the 'truth' means
1596029115061100,1:49:57,dennis oldude,who mishandled the whole issue if it wasn't you?
1596029142352991,1:50:26,HALO,The entire anc needs to be dismantled. Anc is nothing but a scam to make people remember 1994 and Mandela and the end of apartheid.
1596029156271310,1:50:39,Tommygun,ANyone here think Nhleko is being scapegoated and is inocent of all (or most) wrongdoing
1596029202370109,1:51:25,Sebastian MoAfrika,:goodvibes:
1596029204952612,1:51:28,HALO,Biggest mistake was giving africans full charge of government when they clearly were not ready. They needed more time to learn how to manage a country and develop morales
1596029247350332,1:52:09,Mohamed Mia,Yes same fire pool clown
1596029253967448,1:52:16,Sebastian MoAfrika,it was Nxesi
1596029278584347,1:52:40,Tommygun,@TheTruthShall SetYouFree sounds a bit patronizing...mistakes were made all round...
1596029285018729,1:52:48,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,Nhleko reported on the firepool report
1596029308428830,1:53:11,Nic van As,"zondo is favouring the anc and its cronies, man. he is not strong enough to control proceedings."
1596029337878482,1:53:41,Alvino Theunissen,Agree @Nic van As
1596029343859394,1:53:45,HALO,You brainwashed people can't see that ANC is so corrupted. Even after the stories of anc corruption were made public people still bloody vote for them.
1596029354446290,1:53:56,Sebastian MoAfrika,anyone with proof of state capture? .... I mean the real state capture?
1596029403641220,1:54:46,Carmem Borba,1
1596029409412580,1:54:52,dennis oldude,Thomas Cleghorn = just like Arbeid Macht Frei but some people admit their mistakes - have you seen any remorse here
1596029415290376,1:54:58,HALO,"Yourll think Mandela was a saint. He was a bloody poster boy. And yes, democracy is a scam. This entire global political system is meant to keep people in a sort of willful slavery"
1596029423321554,1:55:06,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,No one has a right to tell us how to vote.
1596029489392536,1:56:11,Pearl Macarthur,Just read the body language
1596029505091772,1:56:28,HALO,"The fact is that African people vote for anc because they are and Africa party. That's what I have a problem with. They don't care about corruption, they only vote because they the same skin colour"
1596029517803709,1:56:41,HALO,an African party*
1596029533337159,1:56:56,Aobakwe Mokalake,Coma Hurley do u have any thing to say
1596029540206857,1:57:03,Earnest Munyoro,there is no better alternative they can trust
1596029546930088,1:57:10,dennis oldude,even the commission formulation and activities are wrong in the eye of this weetness
1596029549241422,1:57:12,Sebastian MoAfrika,Advocate Mkhari
1596029555515957,1:57:18,MIKE DURBAN,But Anybody in their right mind would not vote for the Commie ANC/EFF..........unless they been brainwashed......ne
1596029562932396,1:57:25,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,There is more than one party that is African-led.
1596029594410907,1:57:58,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,The DA was African-led in the last elections.
1596029618112756,1:58:21,HALO,The rabbit hole hoes deep. Some can't handle the real situation we are in

1596029626810854,1:58:29,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,The EFF is African-led
1596029645406145,1:58:47,Sebastian MoAfrika,the problem with evidence leaders is that they're trying to proof preconceived notions
1596029683831388,1:59:26,HALO,"Some people don't even realise there's a war on your mind, soul. The spiritual war."
1596029712857546,1:59:55,Kevin,All parties are African lead because all of us are Africans....
1596029718323734,2:00:02,dennis oldude,And our government are master of obfuscation =- and they will keep the majority voters in poverty and slavery all for the cost of a food parcel and a T shirt
1596029735406576,2:00:19,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,So it does not make sense to say that black people vote for the ANC only because it is African-led.
1596029744681536,2:00:27,funicanz,He refuses to answer this report question.
1596029745036021,2:00:27,Bruce Mazibuko,No credible court of law could find mr nhleko guilty based on what the evidence leaders led hear. Complete waste of time and resources.
1596029754434847,2:00:37,HALO,"The london crooks are the Rothschild family. They own the reserves banks all over the world. Only Iran, North Korea and Cuba don't have reserve banks"
1596029765849867,2:00:47,MIKE DURBAN,Well said @dennis oldude
1596029804837715,2:01:27,HALO,Yeh our real enemies are spiritual beings

1596029879667674,2:02:42,dennis oldude,Now please let Kate handle of the miscreants
1596029885024894,2:02:47,Sebastian MoAfrika,"Hulley, is a poor lawyer"

1596030540302491,2:13:43,HALO,"What language did Jesus speak? Ancient hebrew. Jesus wasn't a Jew, or Muslim, or Hindu. The only real religion is to know we have one Lord, and that life is meant to be lived in holiness."
