1582632930916643,13:42,Margareth Waterboer,This man must honestly be reigned in...He must adhere to the question-answer code of the commission
1582632972044221,14:24,Rob Nel,Zondo is putting a question to him now
1582633070064006,16:02,Rob Nel,A very long question
1582633087512831,16:19,Margareth Waterboer,"Yes, but he doesn’t know when to stop. That’s how time at the commission is wasted. Zondo himself is also extremely thorough but also too slow and long-winded.."
1582633195390989,18:07,Solutions SA,lecture of note
1582633222655884,18:33,Rob Nel,"I have seen witnesses that avoid answering questions. Now we have a guy whom obviously has nothing to hide, answering honestly and still wrong"
1582633285348793,19:37,Peet Venter,No sooner he's invited to discuss he then crumbles under party peer pressure.
1582633624189595,25:15,Jacky Buster,I'm listening to the witness on the stand. he is lecturing us not testifying. 😀😅😃😄
1582633778137562,27:50,bongile sango,@Mj I agreed with you this is a lecture
1582633815881487,28:28,luzuko masoka,i see no one this guy is talking to who where is evident leader
1582633830447460,28:41,Eugene,I love this guys hair style
1582633872929439,29:24,Khumza M,"government is wasting money, no arrests made but witnesses comes and go"
1582634113859317,33:25,Somebody's Thunder,answer the question man flip
1582634159069865,34:11,Samuel Nembidzane,how long will this commission last and no arrest made wasting money and time
1582634212155473,35:05,Immanuel,is mr carrim the guest speaker here. he is doing most of the talking without being led
1582634511855376,40:03,Cerebis,What is this guy giving evidence about? It seems like a boring lecture?
1582634688222053,43:00,Peet Venter,Carrim needs to answer about the upgrades and CCTV installations at his house by Bossasa's Agrizzi
1582634753318715,44:05,makhosi nobhatyi,He knows his work and explain clearly
1582634926734957,46:58,Immanuel,it seems he is a liberty to workshop this commission as he is speaking for hours on end. i blame the evidence leader. u cant give a witness leeway to taaaaaalk and taaaaalk and equivocated
1582635029015304,48:41,Chetty Home,Peer Venter ...cctv installlations at carrims home ~ do you have evidence ......?
1582635099215019,49:51,Naledzani Mashau,Arrests are emminent First all these thugs need to be stripped off their Powers (Clipped off their Wings)before taking them to Prison.Dudu Myeni is one Example.
1582635104055338,49:55,noordster1,He covers the questions that Zondo needs answered as Zondo said earlier. Also...give him enough rope and he may hang himself. His willingness to talk so much will get him into trouble
1582635144808067,50:36,Lethabo Maesela,jacon ''butternut'' zuma was captured by WMC as well. what a historical mistake
1582635199718056,51:31,Very Berry's,please send
1582635424111383,55:15,Mr Mpho,I used to think this commission is worth every penny
1582635451880029,55:44,Mr Mpho,now I joint those saying it was and still a waste of state funds
1582635462997475,55:55,Woken- N-blessed,Did this one said society that is none racial? thieves. WHO are running SA by the way?
1582635544813800,57:16,Mr Mpho,commission has been granted extension until next year March no more extensions
1582635561151237,57:33,Peet Venter,My humble apologies. It was Vincent Smith who benefited from Bossasa. I misplaced the two.
1582635606932796,58:20,Chetty Home,Thank you Sir ~ appreciate your retraction.
1582635616791179,58:27,Mr Mpho,the extension will take the bill to a billion namasent
1582635658466860,59:11,Nkanyezi Nadine,I like this guy.
1582635666309117,59:18,Mr Mpho,expensive for nothing not a single soul arrested
1582635725213726,1:00:17,Mtokozisi Baleni,"Am just tired of hearing this name Gupta's., simple because nothing will happen to them. Their are history, their gone. Lessons learnt lets move on."
1582635794926271,1:01:26,noordster1,@ Mr Mpho: you cannot arrest anyone If the commission is in progress
1582635915773837,1:03:28,Thabo Maake,Very lively and energetic. He's clued up because he's an extensive reader. I've always admired his chairing of the Finance Committee in Parliament. Holds ministers accountable all the time.
1582636319004817,1:10:12,Nkanyezi Nadine,@Immanuel 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he speaks proper english.

1582637234790372,1:25:26,Chosen One,What is his name by the way?
1582637291216278,1:26:22,Immanuel,yunus carrim
