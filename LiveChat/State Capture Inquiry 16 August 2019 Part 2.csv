1565960122496985,20:33,brenda maluka,"poor mr thabethe is embarrasing himself in front of his children, what a shame"

1565960235302692,22:27,makhosi nobhatyi,This man is shielding Bullet and punches for Ace Magashule I can’t believe why he did this
1565960241032858,22:32,Dominic Przybylski,"Probably has $millions in Dubai bank account, he's not worried."
1565960246002362,22:37,Yolo More,Maleka is always in court. I think he left the commission.

1565960621058348,28:51,Dominic Przybylski,How do they verify beneficiaries? What would stop Ramaposa from getting on the list to get his buffaloes milked for free.
1565960729274933,30:40,Yolo More,I doubt if there is something helpful that will come out of his testimony.
1565960748894253,31:00,makhosi nobhatyi,Did all of these things mentioned by mr Thabethe ever happened people? Those who stay there assist we are dealing with paperwork now I don’t think there was if it was happened for 6 months as I see

1565960875780562,33:07,Dominic Przybylski,Why should Estina register a company for beneficiaries?
1565960909499051,33:40,barbara broadbent,To cover up their wrong deeds!!!
1565960913281531,33:44,Kessa Pillay,whoes goig to

1565960961533054,34:32,barbara broadbent,Yep !!
1565960967396942,34:38,Dominic Przybylski,Considering they had a R17million plan they don't seem to have followed any plan (except the Gupta one).
1565961045535845,35:56,Raven Penny,please npa act now to long this has been going on

1565961334459375,40:45,Derek Main,"Worse than not getting anything back, we are going to be taxed more to fix the fups caused by the Guptas theft."
1565961338162245,40:49,Liz Profe,beneficiaries have not ever seen a cent!!
1565961346541856,40:56,ernest seikano,but they should bring back what belongs to our country

1565961837664393,49:08,Dominic Przybylski,@Zuko Nodada spot on. That's what happens when a government takes tax. It did not struggle to make it so it doesn't care if it wastes it.
1565961895217494,50:05,Christopher Peters,Hope Zondo can see what is happening in gov.

1565962597992765,1:01:49,Nonzy,"I am not waking up early tomorrow, so I can watch till my eyes pop out. Thank you Chair"
1565962625087633,1:02:16,Pastor J.J,@Lorraine Naidoo That is so sad. When I started working I was paid R125 for 6 days of work. It was really hard but also very painful when we were exploited.
1565962643019735,1:02:34,Mama Bless,make sure utilize this funding to the right places...
1565962650882325,1:02:41,Dominic Przybylski,"Apartheid time I was forced into military service, paid R27 per month, enough money for a few beers and cigarettes. The rest was taken to pay for haircuts and for jam to put on bread at breakfast."

1565963206135645,1:11:57,Joseph Akwa,This guy shows everything wrong with govt doing things for on behalf of the people. Govt (or rather the people who work for govt) assume that the people are incapable of decision making.

1565963944042375,1:24:15,Dominic Przybylski,Nobody cares about how well they spend their money as much as the person who earned it. That's why capitalism survives and socialism fails.
1565963958645561,1:24:29,barbara broadbent,You must be a lawyer Mzala?
1565963960402878,1:24:31,Mzalwane Mzala,@barbara broadbent The present PP

1565964123866963,1:27:15,Anne M.,One of the Vrede Farm whistle blowers was murdered in October last year.
1565964126040857,1:27:17,Mzalwane Mzala,The PP report was successfully challenged in court for failing to investigate politicians and focusing only on officials.
1565964189257928,1:28:20,Mzalwane Mzala,It would be interesting to see whether he can claim his job back based on the setting aside of the PP report.
1565964237161823,1:29:07,Lee D. Hendrix,"...Appointing service providers to replace the necessity to employ government technicians, skilled tradesmen, and laborers deny jobs to the citizens. Too dumb to be real."

1565964265940183,1:29:37,Anne M.,@Mzalwane Mzala Was the Hawks arrest done on instruction of the PP or independantly?
1565964301684871,1:30:12,Mzalwane Mzala,They were charged based on Hawks investigations.
1565964303670403,1:30:14,Dominic Przybylski,"This government appoints agents and contractors to do the real work, yet we employ 2 million civil servants who cannot do the work?"
1565964385239941,1:31:36,Mzalwane Mzala,@goolamv If I recall correctly at the beginning he said he was suspended without pay based on the PP report and when he heard nothing after that he asked for his pension.

1565965442518543,1:49:13,Mfanafuthi Gama,He is retired now. I wouldn't know.
1565965453717376,1:49:24,Tsela Kotjomela,@Mfanafuthi Gama he has not the blamed anyone. The level of accountability is high here
1565965462361944,1:49:33,vuyo hlahla,Did he still remember ethics of his office
1565965463349063,1:49:34,Derek Main,@Wilson Hishono Free State

1565965567415131,1:51:18,Derek Main,@Wilson Hishono Maybe originally but they are dealing with the Estina dairy project in Free State so he must be from there now. He was / is FS Agriculture HOD
1565965594053069,1:51:44,Rad bgood,this guy is gonna spill the milk
1565965623439262,1:52:13,Mfanafuthi Gama,He has answered all that's posed. What is the issue?
1565965640568993,1:52:31,Rad bgood,hes still busy

1565965702310971,1:53:33,Derek Main,@Mfanafuthi Gama The issue is that he thinks the bare minimum is sufficient instead of asking the necessary hard questions before spending millions of taxpayer money.
1565965709027339,1:53:39,Granny Mokwena,he's lying
1565965713811461,1:53:44,Zaahier Adonis,done means finshed in english

1565965834725053,1:55:45,Derek Main,@Mfanafuthi Gama You obviously haven't been listening to all of his testimony. DCJ Zondo went on at length asking why he didn't find out more about Estina before partnering with them.
1565965846826751,1:55:57,Derek Main,He said he didn't think it was necessary.
