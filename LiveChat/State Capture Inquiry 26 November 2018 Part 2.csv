1543235067639758,3:29,Donovan Peters,They were asked for proof before Pravin opened a case.
1543235088230573,3:49,Superhero in SA,Cannot open separate cases. Malema must witness here.
1543235102280299,4:03,Tobela Ntshibongo,Malema thinks we are babies. last year he marched several times defending the expulsion of pravin. Now he's telling us that pravin is corrupt/ Which is he talking about.
1543235107166583,4:08,Mfundo Kunene,"lol, they are trying to counter PGs case"
1543235136249512,4:36,dave east,hey thando my boy
1543235150534886,4:52,Mfundo Kunene,"Malema blows with the wind, thats why no one takes him seriously"
1543235162721422,5:04,Superhero in SA,PG case not related to State Capture. Malema's is. He will have to take on PG at this commission.
1543235174677388,5:16,Donovan Peters,"EFF are reverting to their ANCYL days,trying to drown everyone else voice out."
1543235179987709,5:21,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"This guy despises treasury LOL. Understandably, nonetheless."
1543235211781752,5:53,Nkululeko Njapha,@ mfundo kunene if you think no one takes malema seriously you must be living in different country.
1543235229254337,6:10,Superhero in SA,Admitting guilt
1543235270466285,6:52,Mfundo Kunene,@Nkululeko Njapha only stupid/brainwashed people do
1543235279155514,7:00,Superhero in SA,PG corruption case not linked to State Capture?
1543235304166309,7:25,Donovan Peters,"This guy does not like ""processes"".He was supposed to answer questions but asks to give a statement."
1543235304994437,7:26,Superhero in SA,The one Malema is opening tomorrow
1543235377327436,8:39,Nkululeko Njapha,Not that i follow Juluis it is reall naive and bordering on stupidity to suggest that follwers of juluis are stupid or brainwashed.
1543235403062391,9:04,Donovan Peters,He still has to answer Adv. Maleka's questions.
1543235403090306,9:04,Superhero in SA,oh I thought all state capture will be covered here
1543235450830884,9:52,Mfundo Kunene,@Nkululeko Njapha to actually think Malema'sfollowers/sheep arent stupid is what I would call bordering on stupid/naiveity
1543235459087350,10:00,sakhile mtshali,Mzwanele is clear is a diamond!
1543235494509899,10:36,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,Who was heading Treasury when this 90/10 exclusion was effected? Manyi is enlightening bafowethu
1543235504647379,10:46,Nkululeko Njapha,"all i am saying is you have every right to disagree, but don't insinuate that someone is stupid just because they have different view"
1543235522519619,11:04,Ntokozo Cele,This guy just killed PG
1543235524530150,11:06,Donovan Peters,What Manyi fails to say is the Guptas were naturalised Indian S.A. but now they claim they fighting for the guy in the township.
1543235526878169,11:08,Superhero in SA,PG acting in his official or private capacity?
1543235533784062,11:15,Ewald Kruger,"Quite right, who doesn't want to wear a ROLEX?? @Nkululeko Njapha​Not that i follow Juluis it is reall naive and bordering on stupidity to suggest that follwers of juluis are stupid or brainwashed."
1543235534348705,11:16,Ntokozo Cele,90/10 is killing us
1543235550137505,11:31,Mfundo Kunene,"@Nkululeko Njapha not calling out people for stupidity is what leads to the rise of clowns, like Malema, in the first place"
1543235616909181,12:38,ofhie Muofhe,"i stay in limpopo Venda, then i have to submit a tender in joburg. transport, accommodation and pricing"
1543235623759324,12:45,Nkululeko Njapha,all i am saying we must be mature in our debates lets not insults those that we don't agree with.
1543235667341984,13:28,Tobela Ntshibongo,Malema is a distorted politician. pure useless
1543235668297834,13:29,Nkululeko Njapha,put facts not news paper headlines

1543235696583399,13:58,Donovan Peters,"I hate ppl who talk the talk but when you look at the trail they left,you only see S.A. money in Gupta bank accounts."
1543235718836898,14:20,Nkululeko Njapha,I think Thando you are challenged
1543235735131791,14:36,Mfundo Kunene,"we shouldnt hide the fact that some parties/leaders arent gifted with the best senses. its more of a popularity contest, that possessing actual content, as a public figure"
1543235787777974,15:29,ofhie Muofhe,Mr Manyi has a point
1543235802981088,15:44,Ntokozo Cele,This judge is not himself today I'm not sure nje...
1543235832736768,16:14,Tobela Ntshibongo,Thando that's what propaganda does. It has reduced your ability to think logical and analyse the whats going on into our country
1543235837243213,16:19,Sthakathi Khumalo,Thando Nkutha Its not that people just follow characters.. some leaders provide evidence and we just comment based on their evidence
1543235877489427,16:58,Donovan Peters,Manyi talking about black business is like Zwane saying he never stood up for the Guptas.
1543235917200400,17:37,Nkululeko Njapha,When you are mature and thoughtful. you will know that no human is infallible. If you spend all your time looking faults it something don't expect to find anything else.
1543235925182111,17:46,Mfundo Kunene,"@Ntshibongo Tobela exactly! we are more concerned about personalities, that principles. we even find ourselves defending our politicians amidst the bare truth!"
1543235937595484,17:59,Mbulelo Bikwani,Legislation uses equality instead of equity.
1543235937641781,17:59,Tobela Ntshibongo,@Donovan Peters if you can share to us when did he stand for guptaz i would appreciate

1543236177860721,21:59,Thato M,Mention the names Manyi.
1543236182295924,22:03,peter pott,intelligence cadres are at play here. they are feeding both manyi and Eff with information hard to dispute by those involved. instead they attack their persona

1543236328837322,24:30,Donovan Peters,He defended the inclusion of the Guptas in BEE at the expense of the S.A black businesses.
1543236332992293,24:34,Thato M,@Thando Nkutha speaks without any substance. He dismisses anybody he disagrees with by name calling. Forgive his intellect

1543238440585485,59:42,Kopz Koape,Down down pravhin ..Is this operation tikka masala???
1543238450084275,59:51,Monique Jones,"A ""loaded"" question is one you are afraid of answering truthfully and hence will incriminate yourself"
1543238455555554,59:56,Kuvhanganani Musekwa,Why are they entertaining all this lies from Manyi
1543238455768389,59:57,Asanda Mndende,Mr Maleka is weak
1543238457416095,59:58,Thato M,"Maleka knows with Manyi going on, certain revelations might be revealed causing them to call more witnesses, like Madonsela"
1543238459195204,1:00:00,peter pott,but pravin spoke at length
1543238485560811,1:00:27,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,He loves all the Gupta owned media outlets LOL
1543238510131274,1:00:51,Thamsanqa Nomayela,I like Manyi s behaviour Gordan was lecturing us here.
1543238521261781,1:01:02,Thato M,Mainstream media gets things wrong
1543238548588455,1:01:30,eugene de vis,I think Mr. Many needs a break..
1543238549289561,1:01:30,Michael Jackson,They don't get things wrong... they Err with intention
1543238564411827,1:01:46,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Come on!! What is the role of the media? To be soft on government?
1543238567744530,1:01:49,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Hehehe
1543238568385964,1:01:50,Monique Jones,If you really payed attention you will see that Jimmy has lied already. He said he struggled to pay attention to Gordhan's testimony but yet he says he didn't watch inquiry
1543238572190868,1:01:53,vincent kolobe,😂😂😂😂 manyi is playing dumb now
1543238576488581,1:01:58,Michael Jackson,Media what
1543238578844509,1:02:00,howie bester,why were they allowing Pravin to lecture then?

1543238601358639,1:02:22,Kopz Koape,Naledi pandor is next..Also fire the sleeping minister with the Afro
1543238610356430,1:02:31,ashlee ka ndlovu,i don't see a reason why not Manyi can contextualize his answers others before him went on and on to a point i had to rethink what was the question to bigin with
1543238662381095,1:03:23,hilton modike,but he said yes 10% critical of state
1543238664918888,1:03:26,Monique Jones,Mama always said it's hard to remember your lies cause you have to tell so many to keep up with the first one
1543238665055018,1:03:26,Ewald Kruger,Oh how POETIC you are Manyi 😀 😀 😀
1543238671931376,1:03:33,Mbulelo Bikwani,There's a difference between leading a witness and cross examining a witness. Pravin was being led and Manyi is under-cross examination.
1543238737884369,1:04:38,Thamsanqa Nomayela,True Mbulelo
1543238740887094,1:04:42,Marvel Ramatshela,"One can lecture such as he/she wants during submission. But during cross-examination, one needs to answer questions as straight forward as possible. not all Yes or No answers need motivation, period!"
1543238757966891,1:04:59,Kopz Koape,Zuma is the mastermind of state capture..He should be on trial for state capture
1543238769126064,1:05:10,Monique Jones,Who are the lawyers on here and why are you not working
1543238789881445,1:05:31,Malusi Zitha,but Manyi is just running around the bush and you can even see tht Maleka is getting bored
1543238808027452,1:05:49,Martine Engelbrecht,"If you are telling the truth, cross examination should be a breeze"
1543238808985880,1:05:50,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,TNA was a propagandist small media outlet... who owned it? Guotas... COME ON MANYI!!
1543238819513965,1:06:00,peter pott,"pravin must answer the questions in parliament, not a Brooklyn police station. now he will say in parliament,"" matter is subjudice"
1543238829740203,1:06:11,Fires Firestorm,Come to the point.
1543238866412575,1:06:47,Monique Jones,@MALUSI vukani I don't think so much as bored but the audacity of his lies is funny. He needs to watch the tape later
1543238866417413,1:06:47,Ewald Kruger,😀 👍 @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU​TNA was a propagandist small media outlet... who owned it? Guotas... COME ON MANYI!!
1543238870307396,1:06:51,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Martine Engelbrecht Indeed! It should be a breeze LOL. Now its boiling hot for Manyi!!
1543238870720546,1:06:52,Kopz Koape,Hopefully the ministers appearing at this inquest will be punished
1543238874396190,1:06:55,Fransualdo Kasonda,Manyi is so defensive
1543238881278022,1:07:02,Sthakathi Khumalo,Are we on cross examinations now or what is going on here?
1543238906816544,1:07:28,Donovan Peters,peter pott -peter pott-ANCYL in Red has yet to bring any evidence.
1543238913629338,1:07:35,Monique Jones,Wasn't Manyi's purchase of GuptaTV7 and TNA financed by Gupta Holdings

1543238943309954,1:08:04,xolile macingwane,"But its not fair to request Manyi not to explain, where others were given a chance."
1543238943830848,1:08:05,Michael Jackson,They did there homework
1543238955394506,1:08:17,Kopz Koape,DA members are probably involved in state capture case
1543238964453589,1:08:26,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Monique Jones He inherited the GUPTA owned media

1543239027138891,1:09:28,Mbulelo Bikwani,The chair clarified that he can explain but you can't explain every question. If the question is: Is it Monday today? you need not explain the answer.
1543239028046675,1:09:29,Michael Jackson,let's see if you can get the content right

1543239074203290,1:10:15,Dread Man,@mbulelo Bikwani that is my concern
1543239075764290,1:10:17,Malusi Zitha,@xolile macingwane there is a difference between explaining so to give clarity. and a difference with explaining unnecessary things.
1543239080800306,1:10:22,Monique Jones,@Mbulelo Bikwani buy why is it Monday? Is it because the mainstream WMC media says so? I say prove it!
1543239081318344,1:10:22,Thato M,Zondo is showing bias. He will be attacked by the EFF for this
1543239081937416,1:10:23,Ntokozo Cele,Zondo has a vendetta on TNA

1543239628026402,1:19:29,Lerato Mohale,Zondo makes sense. just like how the media doesn't challenge Pravin to answer EFFs questions as he's obliged to do as a minister

1543239639662729,1:19:41,Thato M,Manyi: Maleka doesn't understand what he is talking about.!!!
