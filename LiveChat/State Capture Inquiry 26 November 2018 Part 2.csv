1543235102280299,4:03,Tobela Ntshibongo,Malema thinks we are babies. last year he marched several times defending the expulsion of pravin. Now he's telling us that pravin is corrupt/ Which is he talking about.
1543235107166583,4:08,Mfundo Kunene,"lol, they are trying to counter PGs case"

1543235162721422,5:04,Superhero in SA,PG case not related to State Capture. Malema's is. He will have to take on PG at this commission.
1543235174677388,5:16,Donovan Peters,"EFF are reverting to their ANCYL days,trying to drown everyone else voice out."
1543235179987709,5:21,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"This guy despises treasury LOL. Understandably, nonetheless."
1543235211781752,5:53,Nkululeko Njapha,@ mfundo kunene if you think no one takes malema seriously you must be living in different country.

1543235304166309,7:25,Donovan Peters,"This guy does not like ""processes"".He was supposed to answer questions but asks to give a statement."
1543235304994437,7:26,Superhero in SA,The one Malema is opening tomorrow
1543235377327436,8:39,Nkululeko Njapha,Not that i follow Juluis it is reall naive and bordering on stupidity to suggest that follwers of juluis are stupid or brainwashed.
1543235403062391,9:04,Donovan Peters,He still has to answer Adv. Maleka's questions.
1543235403090306,9:04,Superhero in SA,oh I thought all state capture will be covered here
1543235450830884,9:52,Mfundo Kunene,@Nkululeko Njapha to actually think Malema'sfollowers/sheep arent stupid is what I would call bordering on stupid/naiveity
1543235459087350,10:00,sakhile mtshali,Mzwanele is clear is a diamond!
1543235494509899,10:36,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,Who was heading Treasury when this 90/10 exclusion was effected? Manyi is enlightening bafowethu
1543235504647379,10:46,Nkululeko Njapha,"all i am saying is you have every right to disagree, but don't insinuate that someone is stupid just because they have different view"
1543235522519619,11:04,Ntokozo Cele,This guy just killed PG
1543235524530150,11:06,Donovan Peters,What Manyi fails to say is the Guptas were naturalised Indian S.A. but now they claim they fighting for the guy in the township.
1543235526878169,11:08,Superhero in SA,PG acting in his official or private capacity?
1543235533784062,11:15,Ewald Kruger,"Quite right, who doesn't want to wear a ROLEX?? @Nkululeko Njapha‚ÄãNot that i follow Juluis it is reall naive and bordering on stupidity to suggest that follwers of juluis are stupid or brainwashed."
1543235534348705,11:16,Ntokozo Cele,90/10 is killing us
1543235550137505,11:31,Mfundo Kunene,"@Nkululeko Njapha not calling out people for stupidity is what leads to the rise of clowns, like Malema, in the first place"
1543235616909181,12:38,ofhie Muofhe,"i stay in limpopo Venda, then i have to submit a tender in joburg. transport, accommodation and pricing"
1543235623759324,12:45,Nkululeko Njapha,all i am saying we must be mature in our debates lets not insults those that we don't agree with.
1543235667341984,13:28,Tobela Ntshibongo,Malema is a distorted politician. pure useless

1543235718836898,14:20,Nkululeko Njapha,I think Thando you are challenged
1543235735131791,14:36,Mfundo Kunene,"we shouldnt hide the fact that some parties/leaders arent gifted with the best senses. its more of a popularity contest, that possessing actual content, as a public figure"
1543235787777974,15:29,ofhie Muofhe,Mr Manyi has a point
1543235802981088,15:44,Ntokozo Cele,This judge is not himself today I'm not sure nje...
1543235832736768,16:14,Tobela Ntshibongo,Thando that's what propaganda does. It has reduced your ability to think logical and analyse the whats going on into our country
1543235837243213,16:19,Sthakathi Khumalo,Thando Nkutha Its not that people just follow characters.. some leaders provide evidence and we just comment based on their evidence
1543235877489427,16:58,Donovan Peters,Manyi talking about black business is like Zwane saying he never stood up for the Guptas.
1543235917200400,17:37,Nkululeko Njapha,When you are mature and thoughtful. you will know that no human is infallible. If you spend all your time looking faults it something don't expect to find anything else.
1543235925182111,17:46,Mfundo Kunene,"@Ntshibongo Tobela exactly! we are more concerned about personalities, that principles. we even find ourselves defending our politicians amidst the bare truth!"
1543235937595484,17:59,Mbulelo Bikwani,Legislation uses equality instead of equity.

1543236177860721,21:59,Thato M,Mention the names Manyi.
1543236182295924,22:03,peter pott,intelligence cadres are at play here. they are feeding both manyi and Eff with information hard to dispute by those involved. instead they attack their persona
