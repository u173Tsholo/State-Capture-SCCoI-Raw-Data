1582288105991214,20:27,makhosi nobhatyi,"Dudu Myeni Zuma is in deep trouble no way she will escape this evidence, only jailed time for her"
1582288357662226,24:39,D Thomas,I am a bit confused here. Are spare parts capitalised or is he conflating assets verification and transactional procedures?
1582288448849194,26:11,Lee D. Hendrix,...Spare parts are mandatory upfront expenses.
1582288558719543,27:57,DJ DJ,so what has he said i have just come on
1582288597911829,28:36,D Thomas,There are technical accounting differences between Fixed Assets and recurrent expenditure.
1582288644686341,29:26,DJ DJ,ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ go figure that one
1582288652597154,29:33,Granny Mokwena,"so politicians, political appointees,banks,auditors and private companies were all involved in the looting except for the poor people"
1582288692404137,30:12,Granny Mokwena,poor people I mean you're everyday hardworking person
1582288715174954,30:35,Anne M.,Correct
1582288722795506,30:45,D Thomas,This fellow is getting away with a lot because the commission does not appear to understand some of the incorrect statements he is making
1582288726111156,30:48,Rohe Maharaj,"Granny, corruption cannot happen without the private sector. They are equally responsible."
1582288741512801,31:03,roza,hi
1582288747523655,31:07,roza,whats hap
1582288750211246,31:11,Tinashe Mangena,@D Thomas Major spare parts qualify as Property Plant & Equipment when they are expected to be used during more than one annual period
1582288821491609,32:23,Granny Mokwena,"of course the private sector is complicit in State capture, I don't think anyone can factually despute that."
1582288904593483,33:46,Lee D. Hendrix,"....But, billionaires look for jobs in government and they need money to need more money to hoard and participate in an economy that they control."
1582289041413951,36:02,D Thomas,"@Tinashe Mangena, if the parts are to replace components of an asset does not necessarily make the part an asset but"
1582289058405074,36:20,MIKE DURBAN,Geeez......i was taught not to loot/steal anything that does not belong to you............no morals ...ne
1582289099743931,37:01,MIKE DURBAN,Dunno how others are taught.....makes you think...ne
1582289206831918,38:48,MIKE DURBAN,Mmmm.......reckon it's that Entitlement mindset...ne
1582289220959274,39:03,D Thomas,Tinashe Mangena sorry for breaking up. He was talking about repair work and reinstallation. These cannot be classified as fixed assets
1582289335035269,40:56,FieliesSA,"@MIKE DURBAN Agreed! My parents used to scare me that if I steal, I sleep in jail. Thinking back it might be harsh, but the principle is valid..."
1582289691922091,46:51,T Harris,"t him answer questions with a yes or no, rattles on with piffle"
1582289711277659,47:12,D Thomas,"I think this fellow is taking advantage of hindsight. In my opinion, there was widespread failure and general incompetence across all the related institutions"
1582289811106257,48:51,FieliesSA,Woohoo!! Welcome back Mrs Hofmeyer!
1582289812443241,48:52,T Harris,I hope the commission is shown the comments.
1582289839089348,49:18,Lee D. Hendrix,"...Even Though things look bad economically, morally, legally, and reasonably...your tax money and vote must remain consistent to form the sense of an applied corporate education at its best."
1582289895157430,50:16,Paul Buchel,Well said Lee.
1582290029465057,52:31,Mtokozisi Baleni,the problem with us poor people is that we hear all stories of presumably our money being stole from Gvt and private sector but we have always been and remain poor. only the tax payer feels it.
1582290038400157,52:37,Pheladi Lamola,Hi guys. Just got back. What's with the blank screen?
1582290040215653,52:39,MIKE DURBAN,@Lee Hendrix ...true.......people must just not vote for the ANC/EFF............cause we'll be back in the same boat......
