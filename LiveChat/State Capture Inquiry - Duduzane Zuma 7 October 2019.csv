1570437749342473,36:13,Nelson Musoliwa,Duduzane might be regarded as a crook but he was not born a crook his father stupidity played a big role in his untoward behavior

1570438407410740,47:10,Loyiso A. Jonase,Let us not worry about his character. The questions asked have nothing to do with him as a person but to link it to purpose and suspicion of state capture. All questions are relevant for commission.
1570438414784749,47:17,Teboho Maphakisa,What's up with the fancy bottle of water?

1570438519498902,49:02,Loyiso A. Jonase,"Let us not worry about the water container. It does not give us answers and proof of state capture. The agenda is state capture not water bottle, not his clothing or any other. State capture only"
1570438537533854,49:20,Khaya Nomoyi,Why would all these people lie about the presence of Guptas in these meetings?He even went to an extent of arranging a meeting between the Guptas and Ramathlodi.

1570438710652135,52:14,Vic SetheMasewawatla,"@Norma Mzimela even a 7year old will ask, where are we going???"
1570438712489644,52:15,Mzalwane Mzala,I thought Duduzane would read Fana Hlongwane's evidence to the PP.
1570438716832814,52:19,Muzikayise Mtshali,So Jonas jumped not knowing where he was going???
1570438726219169,52:28,AGARO WANJE,"But Zuma has older sons, why did he put the youngest of them into this jungle?"

1570438735810649,52:40,Johan Peens,that is a lie
1570438745114166,52:47,Loyiso A. Jonase,Am chilled Mrs. Anderson. I was just correcting something that has nothing to do with what is investigated. I want us to look and listen to facts that will prove state capture not water.

1570438778244685,53:21,Mzalwane Mzala,Jonas knew that they were going to meet Fana Hlongwane. The actual venue would have been not that important
1570438780098381,53:23,Khutso Malope,"We are listening, we just happen to notice the little stuff as well"
1570438808263061,53:51,Wesley Van Der Heyde,Who received a call? Duduzane ro Jonas? surely that should be easily verifiable!
