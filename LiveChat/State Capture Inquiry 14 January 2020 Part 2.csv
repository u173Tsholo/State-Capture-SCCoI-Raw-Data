1579009611765789,1:43:09,Anne M.,@Cerebis Possibly.
1579009698288958,1:44:36,makhosi nobhatyi,We all know Zuma doesnâ€™t take ownership always pointing fingers to other people while he hide himself behind the laws and enjoy protection from the ANC now they must come up tell us truth

1579009948671903,1:48:46,Kevin Simon,Surely by now we should know JGZ does NOT want to appear before the Commission. JGZ does not care about our opinions of him. History repeats itself. If he wanted the truth known he would testify.

1579010104743240,1:51:21,MIKE DURBAN,I think Zondo is forgetting that he Is the Law......
1579010161567785,1:52:19,Anne M.,I think DCJ is making sure that his findings and instructions can't be overturned in court.
1579010224767539,1:53:22,Lungisani Ntshonga,@Anne agree with you
1579010231619607,1:53:28,MIKE DURBAN,@Anne M. ..I really hope you are right........like i say....losing a bit of faith in him
1579010239501027,1:53:36,Kevin Simon,Zondo has rules he must comply with else his findings will be challenged procedurally. Not so with the State Capture criminals.
