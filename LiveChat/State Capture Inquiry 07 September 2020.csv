1599468817975122,42:13,Tebogo Sibilanga,We have poor quality opposition parties which do not really give the ANC any sleepless nights. And the mushrooming of new political parties is not helping either.
1599468819455035,42:14,Rita,Zuma was the beginning of the ANCs corruption
1599468837534764,42:33,Theo van Zijl,The Prez should have acted earlier on fraud to maintain credibility. He has however treated the whole State capture like a fart and hoped it would go away. Alas . .it will hang around for a long time

1599469475764603,53:11,Xolani Nhleko,"no, I'm hopeful that the anc as an organisation is not corrupt but certain individuals who are corrupt"
1599469491371416,53:26,Tommygun,its this dream we are sold of conspicuous consumption that poor and ill educated will do anything to atain. Ppl gotta realise you can only drive 1 car at a time and live in 1 house. We are sold greed.

1599469579427965,54:53,Thabo Mokoaleli,My parents and my family suffered under the previous regime and I had to stand up to fight for our Freedom. But I won't let ANC to be captured by clear rascals.
1599469582365666,54:57,Kariba Moetanalo,@dada ngova : corruption exists globally with a certain limitations. The ANC grabs the whole meal from your table and then continues to force their filthy hands down your throat to extract everything.
1599469588895242,55:04,dada ngova,Well you will learn when you visit your library..put any party in power there will always be bad ones
1599469600398890,55:16,James Godloza Godloza,i might be wrong but the commission is very informative yet useless
1599469622885864,55:38,Trevor bee Botes,you right
1599469639270717,55:54,Rita,yes James made us aware of more looting than we anticipated
1599469667514590,56:22,dada ngova,"@ Kariba I disagree, there are no limitations in other countries. name one which has limitations"
1599469668752443,56:23,Kariba Moetanalo,Bring bad the DEATH PENALTY. Hang every ANC fraud star like yesterday...
1599469728816920,57:23,Xolani Nhleko,lol
1599469747713644,57:43,dada ngova,It's going to be bad before it gets better..that's the continent's style
1599469778130755,58:13,Xolani Nhleko,yeah i guess so
1599469783889590,58:18,Tom Thumb,@Thabo you SPEAKING like your entire family is doing well under these thieves
1599469787728126,58:22,Kariba Moetanalo,"@dada ngova : i am based in Saudi Arabia and anyone found guilty of such crimes, will have their hands chopped. Others will even have their heads chopped off... Corruption is almost zero here..."
1599469800184881,58:35,James Godloza Godloza,i had seen my father full of blood beaten by white bosses of that time and i have seen him rejoice under the first democratic president unfortunately he did not leave long enough to see this
1599469812406096,58:47,Rita,katiba...ANC will never do that bcos they will all be in orange uniforms
1599469822541414,58:57,lizzietitana,go and vote for your own choice that will free you from your misery. your vote counts
1599469856466047,59:31,Rita,yes your vote can visibly bring you misery too
1599469937156329,1:00:53,dada ngova,"@ Kariba the King's bad boy jumps into other countries to kill his adversaries,steal wealth from his cousins and family and jail them indefinitely, that's corruption at its core"
1599469990533875,1:01:46,Tom Thumb,@ Kariba lol the only reason there is almost know corruption in Saudi Arabia is because all the thieves are enjoying there money there keep an eye out for the Gupta's
1599470118101941,1:03:52,dada ngova,I live in a so called first world country and they fight over corruption all the time..no sort of zondo commission to display such cases
1599470205631048,1:05:21,Rita,exactly..the commissions are a form of payment to comrades too? too many commissions no outcomes
1599470272445591,1:06:27,Gerard Victor,"This is trial enough and throw them all in jail. seize assets, freeze bank accounts and let the families of those so corrupt suffer as well as they all knew,"
1599470284614095,1:06:40,Jongi Cayalli,is Zondo going for the Second cup of tea? Can someone plz call him back..
1599470326187931,1:07:21,skeetpetegibbs,I wonder how many times a day he removes and replaces his mask
1599470354263175,1:07:50,Lebohang Mofokeng,Tebogo you assertion is very correct ANC thinks that they made us a favour......
1599470386350060,1:08:21,Rita,Gerhard if it was u or I that's what would have been done
1599470415943131,1:08:51,Tebogo Sibilanga,People come to these commissions and lie under oath knowing very well that nothing`s going to happen to them. Why then would one have faith in this very expensive circus?
1599470499689453,1:10:15,Rita,the ones who will continue to vote for the Anc have faith in them unfortunately
1599470523158375,1:10:38,Gerard Victor,Just jail the lot and save the taxpayer a lot of money. Thanks to JZ and his crew and the trillions stolen blatantly everyone involved needs a new Orange Jumpsuit care of the South African Public .
1599470572213652,1:11:26,Lebohang Mofokeng,"The president cant waste taxes payers money, time and effort put on this exercise without charging the accused and conspirators enough is enough"
1599470688549370,1:13:23,Lebohang Mofokeng,Jacob Zuma and his friends sold our country to the highest BIDDER and they dont care as a long as their families thrive @ the expense of the country. this is unfair

1599471253637427,1:22:49,Lebohang Mofokeng,Musa what do you think ....why were we worse during his tenure???? his choice of civil servants in the strategic SA public sector companies. The aim was to destroy this country

1599471569979286,1:28:04,Gerard Victor,He sold the country but putting uneducated corrupt people in positions of power who cared for nothing but greed. He was Pres so swindled his thieves in and took big back hands. Head of the snake! jail
1599471621215775,1:28:56,Rita,musa how do you feel when a child drowns in a pit toilet. how do you feel when you see people living in 3x3 shacks with bricks holding down bin bags to keep out the rain. corruption musa!!!!!!
1599471705255764,1:29:48,Lebohang Mofokeng,Effective Civil servants were frustrated and repressed to leave their employment people suffered because they did not acceed to corrupt
1599471730189890,1:30:12,Rita,"musa and you still defend the ""snake"" who wanted his day in court but is never available to appear. I smell a rat ..in the ANC talking very cheap"

1599472017816747,1:35:00,Rita,grace you 100% correct they have mansions in the rural areas and live in squalor here for the world to see.
1599472026213531,1:35:08,Lebohang Mofokeng,Rita Scalone yes indeed that man is a slow learner he is short sighted I mean JZ....he just says things for sake of saying them .. day in court the day is granted/// he wants want to appear. confused

1599472238159988,1:38:40,Jongi Cayalli,"Clicks already said sorry, what else u what?"
1599472238486809,1:38:40,Waterbearer,@CanisAfricanis I agree
1599472251161864,1:38:55,a b c,Greetings cousins... I saw that everyone was talking about clicks so I checked it out for myself...
1599472263976434,1:39:08,Tommygun,"I was traumatised having no hair, clicks were not representative of balding ppl"
1599472329435754,1:40:12,MULISA NKUNA,"@thomas cleghorn, that wuld be much better since there will be no comparison of race...... they should have used one race"
1599472414704081,1:41:37,a b c,So if I understand correctly they compared a black woman's brittle hair with a white woman's fine hair?
1599472436278205,1:41:59,Samm Lindy Tshuma,Mr Selena is such a nice calm Dzaddy 😍😍😍😍😍

1599472507594890,1:43:12,MULISA NKUNA,"@a b c, yes and they end up saying black hair are dry and not nice hence white's hair are fine and beautiful"
1599472552627752,1:43:55,a b c,@Mulisa Nkuna oooh... have they apologized yet?
1599472576818066,1:44:19,Lady T,@Samm Lindy Tshuma his voice is soothing though😊.Listen when he is reading😛!
1599472577349485,1:44:20,Mandla J Ngubeni,I commend EEF for this one 👏👏
1599472594212128,1:44:36,Cerebis,I agree....stick to the subject at hand....corruption. The EFF is looking for side shows to hide their VBS Looting. Bring them here and get Adv Kate Hofmeyer onto them.
1599472597663758,1:44:40,Musa Mabunda,"John stop with those dictatorial tendencies of yours, we talk what we want, anywhere"
1599472646502007,1:45:29,Lady T,@Samm Lindy Tshuma I am even attentively listening😊!
1599472678689318,1:46:01,Lady T,"Ntate Zondo...hao o tlhalositse earlier rra,wena tsa hao ke red and black numbering😊"
1599472716529918,1:46:38,Musa Mabunda,why do people like John feel the need to be bossy and issue instructions everywhere they go. they should limit that behaviour only to their homes
1599472719997643,1:46:43,Mike D Fraser,If Judge Zondo was less pedantic we might actually get somewhere. Sometimes it seems like he's deliberately slowing everything down. Or am I imagining it ?
1599472771226191,1:47:36,a b c,@Mike You're totally not alone on that... I've noticed this too very often...
1599472789900844,1:47:52,Lady T,@Mike D Fraser I think most times wants to get clarification which is fair.Today his booklet of evidence is numbered with both red and black instead of the usual black!!
1599472796560830,1:47:59,L Alexander,Law is pedantic guys
1599472808909594,1:48:11,Lebohang Mofokeng,You are imagining things...at the he will alone compiling the report and coming with recommendations/ he avoids confusion

1599472922188629,1:50:04,Waterbearer,Give the guy a chance. It’s the first time he is leading evidence at the Commission - pretty much like his first day on the job
1599472923435425,1:50:05,John Everitt,A suggestion; by its very definition; has NOTHING to do with being dictatorial .... 😇
1599472953662776,1:50:36,a b c,Lol so he's a greenhorn...
1599472961188618,1:50:45,Kevin Davis,he speaks well though
1599472965583290,1:50:48,CoolDude,"no more reports , no more inquiries , just apply the law enquiries just waste time and give the corrupt time to hide the money"

1599473077822695,1:52:41,Mike D Fraser,"Ms G , I was referring specifically to Judge Zondo, who has been in the chair since the outset. I understand fully about clarity, but extreme pedantics is really counterproductive , in my opinion."
1599473093328927,1:52:56,Lady T,@Ndosi nods 😛

1599477423137611,3:05:07,Tommygun,Everyone was too scared to mention his B.O. and so instituted trumped up legal charges to remove him.
1599477455328514,3:05:37,Tommygun,it was completely personal

1599477730740236,3:10:13,Carmen James,@Lady T. Not too much. We have moved very slowly in understanding why our witness had to be removed from Eskom. It was clear that he did not fit in with their plans. They got rid of him by paying him
1599477767595088,3:10:50,Carmen James,@Elton Josea the evidence leader is pedantic but he is getting there
