1542616245708752,23:08,Trucker Trucker,The EFF are marching against Pravin Gordhan today but they were together in the crook place defending him before. That's the superior logic of the Reds of London.
1542616261256972,23:23,olga mayeza,he is being pressured because of he is turning around SOE so the looters are not happy
