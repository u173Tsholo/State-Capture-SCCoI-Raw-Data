1558946322884964,21:09,Precious Ntshangase,"Trasnet was one of the parastatal used as an ATM by these corrupt scavengers. Hawks must start arresting people, this delay because ''we are investigating'' is just a tactic."
1558946546544026,24:52,Bonginkosi Lukhele,lets leave ATM out of this

1558949791368059,1:18:57,Jack Sparrow,@Thando Nkutha embarks on a drug-fuelled dream scene
1558949795902282,1:19:01,Lew464,or maybe he had KFC over the weekend. Now he's got upset stomach.
1558949909246031,1:20:55,Jack Sparrow,Gordhan is both capable and honest - like a magical unicorn in the ANC
1558950172050362,1:25:18,makhosi nobhatyi,"I feel said about what is been published by PP findings, and starting questioning but Gordhan is very discipline cadre, he will fight for this, PP failed with two reports already if she failed again"
1558950340316448,1:28:06,Jack Sparrow,"@Thando Nkutha what he did for pillay has been done *thousands* of times before in the public service. he also obtained legal advice on the matter, and investigations showed all above board."
1558950348227137,1:28:14,Jack Sparrow,why you so adamant to ignore the facts?
1558950379449887,1:28:45,Jack Sparrow,"this matter is 10 years old, and the PP is an idiot with an agenda"
1558950392956974,1:28:58,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Thando Nkutha this is political motivated surely she wear big shoes so I doubt she will win this one on court, PG has put this in review court will decide whether she is right or not , he may b out"
1558950452581267,1:29:58,Granny Mokwena,"no matter how we feel about this useless PP the fact is her remedial action is binding unless challenged in ciurt! Busisiwe will be embarrassed again,just watch."
1558950480388253,1:30:26,Jack Sparrow,"@Granny Mokwena and gordhan will ask for a personal costs order, and will get it"
1558950566338671,1:31:52,makhosi nobhatyi,"All those whom steal money must account, I love DD what he did just step aside and clean his name who are they if there is speculation not stepping aside? Gordhan I wish him success"
1558950661545712,1:33:27,Jack Sparrow,@Thando Nkutha what has education got to do with it>
1558950796209842,1:35:42,Jack Sparrow,"@Thando Nkutha dearie, you speak horseshit. let the adults sort it all out"
1558950804969780,1:35:50,Naledzani Mashau,Paraffin Gordhan stated it categorically that he's instituting legal practitioners to oppose the recomendation by the PP
1558950818203791,1:36:03,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Thando Nkutha I think you had it wrong, you must do research first, he is educated, Pharmaceutical, only Zuma who was not, so don’t tarnished him for this wait this is going to court and you will see"
1558950941886908,1:38:08,Vish Govender,Brian Molefe is a strong contender for state capture King
1558950945315697,1:38:11,Jack Sparrow,"More likely scenario: PP acting on orders from cockroach-in-charge, who is terrified of Gordhan because of cigarette smuggling."
1558951034104499,1:39:40,Naledzani Mashau,There are a lot of people from the ruling party who wants to see Paraffin out of the organization and out of Ramaposer's cabinet
1558951090977148,1:40:37,Jack Sparrow,@Thando Nkutha oh ffs. you sound like something from star wars.
1558951197376652,1:42:24,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Thando Nkutha who employed Pillay? Isn’t commission itself after being appointed ?
1558951236974091,1:43:02,Vish Govender,Gordhan's issue is an administrative one. Intent is important. There is enough information in the public domain to support Pravin Gordhan. The PP is going to have a fight on her hands.
1558951347375845,1:44:53,Vish Govender,TK please do your research. This is an old story.
1558951377219567,1:45:23,makhosi nobhatyi,"I am not saying Gordhan is not guilty or not but worries me they she published this was in a hurry without giving his side to read, consult and make decision but we don’t see that here"
1558951529363508,1:47:55,makhosi nobhatyi,"PP is to investigate the matters not older than 3 years so we will follow this until the end, seems attacking Gordhan personal?"
1558951587075769,1:48:53,Kevin Simon,"In the matter of the PP and PG, what about the 2011 exculpatory opinion from Vlok Symington? Why is PP silent on this? Does this PP have an agenda?"
1558951629758944,1:49:36,Vish Govender,Ok send me your e mail address and I will forward the information to you. I dont have to argue. There is affidavits and evidence which sadly the PP chose to ignore. You have right to believe
1558951659463322,1:50:05,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Thando Nkutha I am concerned about corruption and I am against it. let us wait until this reaches courts and court will decide
1558951748845927,1:51:35,Vish Govender,I agree. Let us wait and see the demise of the PP. Not many legal minds support her at the moment.
1558951788419737,1:52:14,Kevin Simon,PP timing is very suspect in my view. Ignored inputs on 21 and 22 May to get out report just be CR17 can announce his cabinet. Last kicks of a dying horse I think.
1558951829265619,1:52:55,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Thando Nkutha the man didn’t steal money so let us start there commissioner went to treasury for approval
1558952047370588,1:56:33,makhosi nobhatyi,"I don’t want president to include Gordhan with this cabinet for temporary until he sort out this when he reshuffle cabinet he can come back, I am clear, then we will see"
1558952051378791,1:56:37,Vish Govender,TN you don't know. I say to you the NPA withdrew charges. The Nugent inquiry has made a finding which has not been challenged.
1558952058183873,1:56:44,Vish Govender,Legal opinions in the public domain and most important of all process was followed.
1558952080678167,1:57:06,Kevin Simon,This exculpatory opinion was only found and released after the acting commissioner went through the now fired commissioner's docs. How the mighty have fallen!!
1558952116393574,1:57:42,Kevin Simon,Ask Tom.
1558952171053073,1:58:37,Kevin Simon,He could have cleared up this mess at the Nugent Commission. He ducked...and dived...
1558952220285087,1:59:26,Kevin Simon,YES! Agreed
1558952300015647,2:00:45,Vish Govender,TN he did qualiify. He was 56 at that time. Early retirement was valid. The topping up was the concern for which Gordhan sort advice.
1558952437122680,2:03:03,123davyb,"There was a reason why Shaun Abrahams did not prosecute because there was no possibility of prosecution, but yet the PP investigated again with only 2 days of deliberation."
1558952492795858,2:03:59,Kevin Simon,As strange as it may sound. This I understand was common practice in the public sector. Custom and Practice I think its called.
1558952550142795,2:04:56,123davyb,"This report 2 will be overturned, watch this space. Timing is timing. As Gordhan says connect the dots."
1558952585487187,2:05:31,Jack Sparrow,@Thando Nkutha he broke no law!
1558952709076333,2:07:36,Jack Sparrow,I'm friends with many people who work for me. Am I automatically corrupt if any agreement is made between us that benefits them?
1558952765010028,2:08:31,Vish Govender,TN I think you are getting it wrong. I was a Zuma supporter in the early days when I thought he cared for the poor. Now I know differently. We must do a balancing act and be objective.
1558952795605161,2:09:01,Jack Sparrow,"@Thando Nkutha nope, indirectly I work for the state"
1558952846521910,2:09:53,Jack Sparrow,no it's not. corruption is corruption
1558952995301719,2:12:21,Vish Govender,I think we are on the same page but looking from a different angle.
1558953029455557,2:12:56,Dr. LoLCat,this commission is just a destruction for blacks to loot in the background
1558953120954155,2:14:26,Jack Sparrow,@Thando Nkutha it would be if it happened - but it didn't.
1558953249624572,2:16:35,Michelle Kingsley,so this is a copy and past contest ?
1558953524260483,2:21:10,Kevin Simon,TN. IF NDPPs did not delay the Zuma case...…...
1558953576569107,2:22:02,Jack Sparrow,"@Thando Nkutha he responded, and two days later she made a finding - which ignored his input. he was also waiting for her to explain the ""special circumstances"" by which she was persuing an old case"
1558953588061819,2:22:13,Jack Sparrow,illegally...
1558953891578574,2:27:17,Mark Bomvana,Bring back Agrizzi
1558953899167057,2:27:25,Vish Govender,Lots of it has already been unpacked. A pity I cannot share all the stuff that I have followed over the years. This story is not new to me.
1558954090262519,2:30:36,Jack Sparrow,@Thando Nkutha he requested clarification of the legal grounds by which she was making what he considered an illegal demand. Which she didn't provide. The courts will give her a bloody nose for it.
1558954137109920,2:31:23,Vish Govender,I dont think it is that simple. You see Gordhan is very astute in that he knows due processes and he made sure he followed the prescripts. Thats where he has protected himself
1558954236360541,2:33:01,Vish Govender,I feel legally the courts will be hard pressed to find against him.
1558954390102435,2:35:35,Jack Sparrow,"@Thando Nkutha if she wants to investigate a case more than two years old then she has to provide the special circumstances under which she is acting. Law is law, not bananas."
1558954405266301,2:35:50,Vish Govender,TN Zumas instance is different. He has appeared in court a number of times and to the best of my knowledge he has a 100 % losing record. The lawyers are chowing his money.
1558954410414545,2:35:55,Jack Sparrow,an advocate should know how to operate within the law
1558954466113447,2:36:52,Jack Sparrow,"as mentioned, Gordhan is very astute in that he knows due procoesses"
1558954509584831,2:37:35,Jack Sparrow,@Thando Nkutha FFS I'm referring to the PP act. Nothing to do with state capture inquiry
