1581338278807821,15:48,Kevin Simon,This was a thinly disguised money skimming system. RET in action?
1581338303014433,16:12,D Thomas,please can anyone confirm if this is part of state capture? It appears to me that this is a transaction that should have been subjected to audit (internal and external)
1581338354981609,17:04,Paul Buchel,That false smile makes me want to puke.
1581338359022847,17:08,Sherwin Peters,this is such fun to watch

1581338393304330,17:42,JS Bach,Is she smiling or is she showing her teeth?
1581338426913903,18:16,skeetpetegibbs,She will start coughing shortly ala Zuma.
1581338438061927,18:26,Anne M.,@D Thomas One of many corrupt transactions. The Auditor General has issued many qualified audit reports which have been ignored.
1581338467418787,18:57,Mohamed Mia,Eish flu
1581338527753873,19:56,D Thomas,Elvis thanks but my understanding of state capture is where the activities of state were severely influenced to almost inability to act in the interest of the country
1581338632240725,21:41,Elvis Malakoane,D Thomas yes Tom your understanding is not wrong and this deal they did did exactly what you say
1581338638886462,21:48,D Thomas,"Anne, if there was evidence of fraud then all parties should have been charged to court. State capture is treasonable"
1581338671191417,22:20,Person of interest,"SAA down the tubes because of this kind of activity, so you go to Zondo to explain. what else is unclear?"
1581338711509340,23:00,Gareth Morgan,anyone remind me what role she help and who she is related too ?
1581338755470634,23:44,Anne M.,"@D Thomas the NPA was also captured, which is why the previous Public Protector recommended a Commission of Inquiry."
1581338769781678,23:58,Person of interest,She was implicated by previous witnesses.
1581338780049171,24:09,Anne M.,@Gareth Morgan she was the previous Head of Procurement at SAA Technical
1581338805775817,24:35,Kevin Simon,She is making sure all these people are called
1581338815708240,24:45,Gareth Morgan,"@Anne M. thanks , is she currenlty unemployed do we know / Care ?"
1581338856848161,25:26,Anne M.,No longer at SAA. She's an admitted advocate so might be practising in that capacity
1581338875748789,25:45,D Thomas,Anne thanks for your response but my concern is that the penalty for state capture in some countries is death.
1581338880081129,25:49,Wildthing,What was one unit resell value. if someone knows.
1581338935119014,26:43,Anne M.,@D Thomas Are you South African? We don't have the death penalty in this country.
1581338957838093,27:06,JS Bach,"what are you grinning about, idiot????"

1581339280854803,32:30,Anne M.,"@D Thomas That the culprits will eventually be prosecuted, and to try and recoup some of the money."
1581339289680079,32:38,Dominic Przybylski,@D Thomas the ultimate objective is to prevent the destruction of our country's economy.
1581339315213887,33:04,Bernard Matolino,reARview price

1581339389144251,34:18,Dominic Przybylski,If it continues our country will become a failed state where nothing works and will end up in mass starvation and total breakdown of society - permanent state of civil war like in DRC/Somalia.
1581339419551712,34:48,Bernard Matolino,"@Paul Buchel I believe that future is not in our lifetime, the way things are going"
1581339432046092,35:00,D Thomas,"Anne, are we calculating how much this possess is going to cost in the end? compared to what might be recovered?"
1581339477917498,35:47,Dominic Przybylski,We won't recover much at all but we may be able to save our country.
1581339491383784,36:00,Wildthing,The dragon will now be blowing fire.

1581339537254105,36:46,Anne M.,The rot and corruption has to stop in order to save our economy. We may not recover enough money to cover the cost of the commission but the corrupt characters have been identified.
1581339537774425,36:47,Dominic Przybylski,We have the controls but they are ignored.
1581339553165419,37:01,Paul Buchel,"@Lex Luger​, True, I'm 60 but would like to see Zuma in jail before I die."

1581339872686466,42:22,Wildthing,Mandisi if you buy a car and three years later want to sell it. you ask the Bank what the book value is. and then you go out to market to try get a better price because the car was well looked after.

1581340140059228,46:48,David Tuer,Asset value and market value are unrelated. The asset value is the depreciated value i.e the purchase value which is reduced by a tax allowance.The market value is what someone will pay for it.

1581341187515591,1:04:16,JS Bach,This lawyer of Memela does not get it into her head that she will be able to re-examine after Kate has finished with her client.
1581341190803531,1:04:19,dada ngova,@ Dominic it will get worse before it gets better
1581341224912051,1:04:54,Dominic Przybylski,Other problem is that black people were kept poor by apartheid so they think that money will make them happy. The happiest people I know are poor.
1581341252824534,1:05:22,Ria Sokiri,nt prepared to answer 🙄

1581341310408395,1:06:19,Phillip Cwazibe,@ Dominic Przybylski Difficulty is that most people do not vote for Governance and accountability but popularity.
1581341312907202,1:06:22,Acid Zil,The write thing will be to put all these thieves in prison for at least 25 years
1581341318015329,1:06:26,Trucap,shooo
1581341324240419,1:06:33,Gareth Morgan,@DJ DJ what was the direct lie ?
1581341352622582,1:07:02,dada ngova,I understand @Dominic 100% most African people believe money is happiness...no it's not
1581341358151810,1:07:06,JS Bach,They can apply for leave to run away.
1581341361819529,1:07:11,Dominic Przybylski,@Phillip Cwazibe The problem with democracy. It makes it almost impossible for a real leader to be in control.
1581341363578385,1:07:13,Musa Mabunda,"The memory stick issue will sting, it's inevitable and she knows"
1581341379045832,1:07:27,DJ DJ,about the memory stick
1581341388378287,1:07:37,Person of interest,The Metadata
1581341410627528,1:07:59,DJ DJ,i think the memory stick shows all the current values and she said she did not know
1581341417211181,1:08:05,Phillip Cwazibe,"@ Acid Zil ​ while they are in prison, they must be fed once a day."
1581341420900415,1:08:09,David Tuer,"@JS Bach. Re the flash stick. The evidence is not that she was the author of the information on the stick, that is someone else, but Memela was the last person to save it on her computer."
1581341443047264,1:08:32,JS Bach,@David Tuer Correct.
1581341452424116,1:08:41,dada ngova,@ Dominic there is no such thing as democracy..nothing..
1581341453153493,1:08:42,Anne M.,"Hopefully, lying under oath will be added to the charges."
1581341473542518,1:09:02,Musa Mabunda,"Once you hear a witness reading back a page number but takes time to find it, you should know issa problem"
1581341510441949,1:09:40,Wildthing,Think her whole attitude has changed now. court hook line and bate.
1581341522318551,1:09:51,Dominic Przybylski,"@dada ngova The only thing democracy does is allow for a change of government without civil war, apart from that it is not worth much."
1581341566863506,1:10:35,Dominic Przybylski,A free market is the only real form of democracy. Every time you buy something it is a vote.
1581341567170288,1:10:36,Gareth Morgan,@Anne M. for sure along with tax evasion etc etc
1581341591152514,1:11:00,Phillip Cwazibe,@Michael Wild ​ Think her whole attitude has changed now. court hook line and bate. Spoiling her dinner.😂
1581341607542116,1:11:16,Paul Buchel,"@Anne M.​, perjury, you can get jail for that as well, however, very seldom in this buggered country."
1581341609455194,1:11:18,Wildthing,True
1581341627028980,1:11:36,Michael Michael,if she dint provide Mrs Sambou with flash.y having difficulty to answer.lair
1581341628942241,1:11:37,Dominic Przybylski,If we don't buy the company goes bankrupt. If we do buy they succeed.
1581341630449821,1:11:39,Mtokozisi Baleni,@DJ DJ to be fair to the liar Ms Memela the Flash stick went thru 6 people before it came back to commission from Soweto back to Midrand and was was not acconted for 3yrs.... Mbanjwa has a point
1581341666752436,1:12:15,dada ngova,@Dominic we can define democracy on simple terms but in reality you can be deposed as a leader under the auspices of democracy..check Zimbabwe
1581341677984038,1:12:26,Kevin Simon,The meta data is reliable
1581341682050707,1:12:31,Phillip Cwazibe,"she side eyed her attorney. That is saying, ""I am caught"""
1581341690205635,1:12:38,DJ DJ,Sorry this lady is rotten
1581341723633780,1:13:13,Dominic Przybylski,@dada ngova Mugabe was not deposed by votes. He was removed by military and ZANU/PF remained in power.
1581341724932161,1:13:14,JS Bach,@Phillip Cwazibe I missed that. You are sharp-eyed!!
1581341747599562,1:13:36,Anne M.,@Mtokozisi Baleni The last person who saved anything on the flash drive was Ms Mamela. The meta data (properties) show that.
1581341827133137,1:14:56,Phil Shongwe,So this means the majority of the people of Zim did love uncle Rob.
1581341829847089,1:14:59,Michael Michael,no to be corrupt
1581341847055693,1:15:16,Acid Zil,We are all so heavily taxed with load shedding and a failing economy with land grabs and a government that’s trying to legalise land theft were everyone has bought their property
1581341847887897,1:15:17,Rory Lee Farnham,Mugabe was literally a murderer and a total racist. He destroyed his country and his people.
1581341900738311,1:16:09,dada ngova,@Rory he did so under democracy shades
1581341900825956,1:16:09,Mtokozisi Baleni,@Anne I agree but to be fair they hve a right to test the evidence before them. Shes a liar and unworthy Advocate but lets be fair
1581341927485049,1:16:35,Anne M.,I agree - her technical expert can check
1581341936176886,1:16:45,DJ DJ,be fair to what. Peoples money have been stolen via BEE
1581341942150232,1:16:51,Dominic Przybylski,@dada ngova That's not a democracy in anything but name. Vote counting was fraudulently altered otherwise MDC would have won under Tsvangir.
1581341952497357,1:17:01,Michael Michael,she will pay alot
1581341960249557,1:17:08,Anne M.,He's going to tell her the same thing (if he's honest)

1581342010426866,1:17:59,dada ngova,@dominic hence I say there is nothing known as democracy..
1581342020356068,1:18:10,Wildthing,They will need to go through every deal She was involved in.
1581342035224053,1:18:24,clive oconnell,Us poor black people need to cheat to make BEE work
1581342077182921,1:19:06,Mtokozisi Baleni,@DJ DJ there is nothing wrong with BEE Corrupt people in Responsible positions steal money hiding behind BEE stealing from our people.
1581342089906132,1:19:19,Acid Zil,"How do they employ such incompetent people, do they buy their certificate’s?"
1581342095384236,1:19:24,Dominic Przybylski,@dada ngova Unfortunately you are right for most countries except a few like in Switzerland and to a lesser extent in other European countries.
1581342099639061,1:19:29,DJ DJ,Not really @clive oconnell
1581342121459812,1:19:50,dada ngova,USA is supposed to be a leader in democracy ..look at how African Americans are murdered by law enforcement
1581342122223935,1:19:51,Derek Main,"@Mtokozisi Baleni BEE in principle is a noble idea but how it is currently practised, it's just an excuse for corruption."
1581342182383141,1:20:51,Derek Main,@dada ngova Police forces the world over are becoming more militarised - including here in SA.
1581342195270585,1:21:04,Phillip Cwazibe,"@ Acid Zil ​How Yes, I have head that certificates are purchased.heir certificate’s? With employment, it is connections that pave the the way."
1581342208659121,1:21:17,DJ DJ,BEE only empowers a single corrupt indivdual
1581342223136100,1:21:32,dada ngova,@zuma then I rest my case pleasure your ego
1581342224243987,1:21:33,Mtokozisi Baleni,@Derek Main Thank you. These Greedy Civil servants with fat salaries also steal from honest BEE companies
1581342243460001,1:21:52,DJ DJ,do you honestly believe a a 100% black owned company would pay its labourers any better
1581342244101846,1:21:52,Dominic Przybylski,@dada ngova USA is not a real democracy. The real power in USA is the big companies. Elections are won by who has the most money. Look how much money Ramphosa had to spend to head ANC.
1581342258260492,1:22:07,Granny Mokwena,imagine if BEE was not hijacked!
1581342273932028,1:22:22,dada ngova,@Derek..agreed

1581342303771793,1:22:53,Derek Main,@Mtokozisi Baleni I agree - there always a corrupter and a corruptee. Our BEE is not working - only a few connected individuals are benefitting. It is not spreading wealth like it was meant to.
1581342307062964,1:22:56,stanely msimango,you never know unless someone talk about. BEE had destroy our believed country...😂😂😂😂
1581342329964204,1:23:19,Michael Michael,mama can lai

1581342340585257,1:23:30,Derek Main,@stanely msimango True that - only the criminals are happy with BEE.
1581342344544489,1:23:33,Mtokozisi Baleni,BEE is the only way to empower Blacks but these(MISS MEMELA and company take over they must be stopped and jailed
1581342356422807,1:23:45,Phillip Cwazibe,Giving long winded explanations is a means to digress and divert the question asked.
1581342376604327,1:24:05,roza,hi
1581342380503900,1:24:09,Dominic Przybylski,BEE is a disaster. If we want a successful country we should just let the economy grow without forcing people to be employed by race. If economy grows everybody gets more opportunites.
1581342384413712,1:24:13,Pastor J.J,90 seconds exceeded by 3 minutes
1581342392905148,1:24:21,Maryann Diamond,lol
1581342404626764,1:24:33,dada ngova,@dominic I agree..people thought Cyril will work wonders because he is an oligarch...you will learn a lot ...he will let people down sadly
1581342414136567,1:24:43,Acid Zil,Affirmative action is races towards a minority group in South Africa just like what Hitler did with the Jews
1581342416459581,1:24:46,Dominic Przybylski,China is great example what happens if economy is allowed to grow without political control.
1581342458635745,1:25:27,Dominic Przybylski,The saddest thing about BEE and AA is that it makes every succesful black person suspect.
1581342463814589,1:25:32,DJ DJ,well said @Acid Zil
1581342479774782,1:25:49,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski I disagree - there is a lot of political involvement in the Chinese economy.
1581342501897631,1:26:10,stanely msimango,"Had definition, simple past tense and past participle of have. ... Have, being the most general word, admits of the widest range of application: to have money, ..."

1581342549173173,1:26:58,Dominic Przybylski,@Derek Main I'm comparing China now with 60% of economy now in private sector compared to the time when it didn't allow private sector at all.
1581342558621883,1:27:07,JS Bach,"YEs, Judge Zondo. That is the correct tender procedure."
1581342564635644,1:27:12,DJ DJ,@Jacob Zuma please re think your 15%
1581342593855339,1:27:41,Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski OK - maybe less political involvement but definitely still there.
1581342620968829,1:28:10,DJ DJ,15% of black individuals only prosper from BEE
1581342624379059,1:28:13,dada ngova,zondos problem is that he doesn't understand some of these operations
1581342629219996,1:28:18,clive oconnell,OK

1581343599539433,1:44:28,Dominic Przybylski,She doesn't seem to understand that she has been in contravention of just about every rule controlling communication with bidders.
1581343607264873,1:44:36,Wildthing,she can continue to study in Jail.
1581343621626624,1:44:50,Ria Sokiri,@felix muyoba she should be demoted and go straight to jail not class

1581343889986301,1:49:19,Phillip Cwazibe,@mandisi ntauzana ​@JS Bach head of SCM would at least know that the tenders calls for the supply of cheese or potatoes.
1581343925475541,1:49:55,Apex Orbit,She wants to change the subject

1581344048815731,1:51:58,Derek Main,@thulani fadashe That's because she goes off on a tangent and he's tired of it.

1581344300263512,1:56:09,thulani fadashe,@ Derek Main basically his not really interested in hearing her side of the story. Hence my comment of prejudice

1581344854781260,2:05:24,mandisi ntauzana,Some of the answers of Adv Memela have been poor but need a skilled re-examination to iron out the poor answers....... I think she has been consistent in her evidence
1581344884021395,2:05:52,David Tuer,@Michael Wild I'll be surprised if her lawyer does much in the way of re-examination. That would only make it worse for Memela.
1581344920094060,2:06:29,skeetpetegibbs,And I think you fell asleep Mandisi
1581344931637246,2:06:40,Derek Main,The reason she shouldn't have communicated with a bidder is because that would give the bidder an unfair advandtage.

1581345015000567,2:08:03,thulani fadashe,@ mandisi ntauzana exactly. Some of us are already putting a guilty verdict forward because of this challenge she has.

1581345040185480,2:08:28,Derek Main,@mandisi ntauzana The clause was put there to prevent any unfair advantage to any bidder. It's obvious.
1581345093231627,2:09:22,mandisi ntauzana,@Derek Main do you think a cleaner in SAA shouldnt talk to a bidder even though the cleaner does not sit in the Bid Adjudication
1581345114311906,2:09:43,Ishaad Mohammed,DCJ is getting irritated with her
1581345126495833,2:09:55,Dominic Przybylski,I responded to many invitations to tender and there's no excuse to ignore any condition of tender unless the buyer explicitly agrees to change the conditions in writing.
1581345135192958,2:10:03,mandisi ntauzana,Chair is reading the clause too wide since the clause is talking about PM who a supplier must talk with

1581345190660604,2:10:59,Derek Main,@mandisi ntauzana She assisted the bidder and they paid for her house. Simple.

1581345257699832,2:12:06,Wildthing,Mandisi another way to look at this. is who give your mother 2.5 million rand when they dont know them.
1581345285302082,2:12:33,Derek Main,@mandisi ntauzana You must be ANC because you take us all for fools.
