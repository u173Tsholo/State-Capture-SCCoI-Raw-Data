1599482496382690,8:30,Frank Jordaan,N.G. he was CEO at Escom when he was suspended without any explanation and replaced with Molefe.
1599482548843891,9:23,Lonwabo Mahlulo,üëÄ
1599482969406453,16:23,Dominic Przybylski,Only 2 South African Companies have a higher turnover than ESKOM - Anglo American and Sasol. So this man should be around the 3rd most qualified/succesful businessman in the country.
1599483018122517,17:11,Dominic Przybylski,If he wasn't then why was he in that position?
1599483038893399,17:33,Thubelihle Bhunu,ANC
1599483182989168,19:56,Frank Jordaan,He was suspended following instructions from Zuma and Myeni to the board.

1599483283502441,21:38,Hlagala Masetlale,he was suspended as part of the state capture project
1599483383574392,23:15,Frank Jordaan,"Quest exactly. That is when 3 executives where suspended and Singh, Molefe and Koko took over at Escom."
1599483482598098,24:56,Carmen James,They understood perfectly. Unfortunately the witness did not serve the Gupta Agenda which was loading at the time.
1599483547900822,26:03,Kamogelo Maphunye,kana how much is this commission costing us?
1599483587952747,26:42,Mmone Benjamin,"Aow Kamo papa, tswaya mo dilong.."
1599483613490085,27:08,Dominic Przybylski,@Kamogelo Maphunye a small fraction on what is going to be spent on giving free laptops to university students.
1599483651241613,27:45,Michael Roebuck,"if you lie enough you convince yourself it's true. I don't think people can believe what they are seeing at Zondo , you cannot make these things up."
1599483664411434,27:58,jw Perold,Why spent so much time on this? We know he was unjustly treated. the Commission must interrogate the real wrongdoers at Eskom
1599483789492663,30:04,Hlagala Masetlale,@kamogelo it's costing us peanuts compared to what the guptas have looted
1599483831633342,30:45,jw Perold,and get the criminals involved in State Capture in jail. That is what the public wants to see. This Commission is costing the public millions and millions and we are not yet seeing justice being done
1599483839713175,30:55,Dominic Przybylski,"It seems this is all just noise... Why isn't SARS going after people who get, fire pools, Aston Martins as presents and drink R7000 bottles of champagne."
1599483905909839,32:00,Salome Seabi,anc always push out all honest people so that its hyena may feed comfortably on our money

1599484102333864,35:16,Frank Jordaan,Salome so true. We lost great people with high integrity who was discarded because they were not prepared to sell their souls to the corrupt hyenas.
1599484115951901,35:31,Dominic Przybylski,Do we actually have a government assuming a government provides economic infrastructure and rule of law?
1599484124401618,35:38,Carmen James,Ms Klein is a cheerleader for Koko!!!!!!
1599484128806980,35:43,Hlagala Masetlale,you're right #salome seabi this guy was just an honest hard working person
1599484177277993,36:31,Mathapelo Mokadi,"I agree, this commission is costing the country. And now I believe the proof is there really, and now some they will end up dying."
1599484201209747,36:55,Frank Jordaan,Ms Klein just another little Zupta puppet.
1599484249641079,37:43,Carmen James,Ngubane a big Gupta enabler
1599484312350247,38:45,Salome Seabi,"If the NPA can get the best senior counsels in SA to deal with all crooks of state capture, more people will disapear like Watson"
1599484356394321,39:30,Frank Jordaan,Koko was the only suspended executive who retained his job. It is now clear why.
1599484358351193,39:32,Zakes Pekwa,"@jw Perow The President signed a proclamation that will enable the NPA to work directly with the investigators of the Commission. There is also the Fusion Center(Hawks, NPA, SIU, SARS, etc)."

1599484403183360,40:17,mathys botha,"the whole cabinet knew what was happening, but they were all there under the flag of ""it's our tern to eat """

1599484423268419,40:38,Waterbearer,"Veneta Klein had until her stint at Eskom, built a formidable career on Boards of large companies. Only to have her name forever tarnished by Guptas"
1599484436070354,40:50,Dominic Przybylski,Even if NPA eventually charges somebody it will be years before they actually get a court date.
1599484452784751,41:07,Salome Seabi,"thats the question, mayby there is still rot in NPA"
1599484518520084,42:12,Hlagala Masetlale,what about if the npa enlists the service of the FBI?
1599484520394845,42:14,Salome Seabi,Special courts must be established to deal specifically with state capture hyenas
1599484525790214,42:21,Dominic Przybylski,Still waiting for JZ to appear in court 15+ years later and still counting.
1599484571224963,43:05,Frank Jordaan,Salome you are right. The NPA was completely destroyed by the likes of Jiba and The Sheep.
1599484585876457,43:19,Salome Seabi,yes

1599486643555021,1:17:37,Lucas Maloka,I think they are the government in waiting becaurs they are the ones who explore the ANC from the Zuma leadership
1599486712335059,1:18:45,Carmen James,"Hi@Lady T. We are still listening to evidence as to how the State Capture Agenda got rid of the witness as Eskom CEO to pave the way for Molefe, Koko and Singh. All enabled by Ngubane"

1599486935441001,1:22:28,Siphiwe Mthiyane,@Mathys Botha being 90% black doesn't mean that the advert was not racist. The people who approved the advert were racist. Clicks promoted that racist act by playing it in public.
1599486946914869,1:22:40,Cosymos55,I concur

1599487084427774,1:24:58,Carmen James,Our witness is a gentleman. He definitely wasn't suitable for the State Capture Agenda.
1599487097723166,1:25:12,Salome Seabi,CLICKS MUST B TAUGHT A LESSON
1599487115477508,1:25:29,Frank Jordaan,"Eddie the meeting in Durban with Zuma was attended by then Escom chairman, Myeni, her son and her advisor. Obviously Brown knew what was about to happen."
