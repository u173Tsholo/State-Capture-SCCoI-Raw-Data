1542788103295059,9:13,Frans Phala,"eff is playing mind games on him, they didn't share any info until he took the stand."
1542788119341026,9:29,Ibutho Khumbane,I never seen him shaken at all
1542788131425635,9:41,Yoliswa Jebe,"He is not shaken at all, the guy know his story"

1542788160830113,10:11,Bruce Andrew,EFF have nothing meaningful to say or to contribute to the debate. Most of the comments in the last two days have been mindless
1542788188366322,10:38,Thato M,"He wouldn't appear shaken obviously, but the matter has got to him & his family at large. For the first time. It is eating him - no doubt"
1542788197838146,10:48,Yoliswa Jebe,if they have anything tangible they must bring it to the commission
1542788229444886,11:19,benjamin Maluleke manyunyu,Gordhan must clarifies the allegations that he was involved in fund raising for the Zuma's re-election in 2012 &we all know that the Gupta funded the campaign

1542788242957121,11:33,Robert 1,this is boring.
1542788285673446,12:16,Houws Houlinou,"""How can Pravin be part of the corrupt ANC and not be rotten himself? Why do you say the ANC is corrupt and then say Pravin and Cyril are different? They are the same,"" Malema said"
1542788286066019,12:16,Zeno of Elea,The commission is an opportunity for the EFF to put their evidence on record. They should bring it to the deputy chief justice.
1542788288752358,12:19,Houws Houlinou,THIS while Julius was part of the corrupt ANC? He must think we are dumb
1542788291352405,12:21,Thato M,"His family has been portrayed as holier than thou, this matter has shaken not only him, but his family and business acquaintances. No sane individual wouldn't be affected negatively."
1542788391238832,14:01,PETER STAFFEN,they wont they rather stand outside and grandstand he never produce the facts
1542788392127091,14:02,THABISO MOGORU,since gordan touch sars ...malema know the true that is the reason the fighting the guy
1542788416723928,14:27,Thato M,"Even his inner circle comrades are shook. His defense has only been the WMC media. they know Julius has dirt on him, shared by the very faction Gordhan & Ramaphosa are fighting within the ANC"
1542788433459356,14:43,Mogamat Allie,it is boring because it is using alot of taxpayers money..every body involved should be prosecuted
1542788447251570,14:57,THABISO MOGORU,that is true
1542788462783116,15:13,peter pott,then what was wrong with this IMC? PG is really having problems with black leadership really
1542788463547907,15:13,Zeno of Elea,Too much conjecture about who knows what. The truth will prevail. Bring all/any evidence to the commission.
1542788475059181,15:25,Leshope Gerald,This commission is more like a chat room of friends.
1542788511362346,16:01,Zeno of Elea,Do you believe that the deputy chief justice is bias?
1542788539919062,16:30,Nelson Musoliwa,Juju is a confused and inexperience politician if Floyd must not be involved with Brian saga why Cr be involved with ANC corruption if not proven. He tjatjarag too much
1542788563849873,16:54,Leshope Gerald,My screen went black
1542788567298612,16:57,Thato M,"When acusations were levelled against some family members no commissions were established but were instead labelled thugs without evidence. Enter Gordhan, people must come under oath. Very rich"
1542788570700963,17:01,Houws Houlinou,SABC go and borrow a little bit of money from China and sort yourself out. This live feed is horrible
1542788572215590,17:02,Mthobisi Zuma,kangaroo court indeed
1542788613380258,17:43,Zeno of Elea,Kangaroo court? So what is our best mechanism to come to the truth?

1542788649783536,18:20,Thato M,"So this Commission lead investigator provided pro bono legal services to Adrian Lackay, Gordhan spokesperson, who is also from SARS with him. Interesting what this unfolding in this State of Capture"
1542788653757605,18:24,Leshope Gerald,Paraffin Kortaan must come out clean.
1542788654951647,18:25,Frans Phala,zuma and bathabile did say should any member of the anc reveal his\her dirty laundry they will reveal their dirty laundry
1542788663907749,18:34,Sthakathi Khumalo,The commission reminds me of Malume Joshua Doors interview with CNN saying he doesn't have evidence but jiki jiki 2018 he knows something!!
1542788665712846,18:36,Lucky Dlamini,lack of competition leaves us with this rubbish live feed.
1542788692475117,19:03,Zeno of Elea,@Thato M did justice Zondo not address this?
1542788700157361,19:10,Aidan Bain,the feed is BAD agreed

1542788762310909,20:12,Wesley M,@Neslon i agree with you.
1542788770258293,20:20,THABISO MOGORU,ZUMA IS BAD
1542788780552866,20:30,Aidan Bain,"amazes me that everybody is coming out now, shows you how scared they were of zuma"
1542788787291551,20:37,Zeno of Elea,@Leshope Gerald did Justice Zondo not address this?
1542788787704494,20:38,Sthakathi Khumalo,"He admitted on CNN, he has no evidence against Zuma!!"
1542788794124892,20:44,Frans Phala,ANC is bad
1542788819140512,21:09,Leshope Gerald,The whole ANC is rotten to the core
1542788822156865,21:12,Thato M,"@Zeno of Elea it was wholly inadequate response one would expect from a Deputy Chief Justice, 2nd in command of the highest court in our land, the final arbiter of our law."
1542788822967566,21:13,Aidan Bain,i dont think there is one part that is great
1542788835167350,21:25,Zeno of Elea,@Sthakathi Khumalo I think he said he has no smoking gun. Not no evidence.
1542788851031960,21:41,THABISO MOGORU,ZUMA WAS WORST THING HAPPENED TO US
1542788871304873,22:01,Sthakathi Khumalo,Zeno of Elea meaning??
1542788872620622,22:02,Aidan Bain,@THABISO MOGORU i agree with you
1542788876309566,22:06,Leshope Gerald,Can anyone inform us why is this commosion being held at Tiso Black star building?
1542788886289790,22:16,Houws Houlinou,@Zeno of Elea The fact that Zuma and the Guptas got rid of him illustrate to me that he was unwilling to cooperate with them
1542788894441469,22:24,Frans Phala,the anc is divided into two parties within itself
1542788905090487,22:35,Wesley M,"The ANC does not deserve the countries vote anymore. Our problem is, we do not have anybody else to vote for. who do we vote for???????"
1542788905102161,22:35,Prescott Smith's Fly Fishing Academy,They are asking him a bunch of easy questions. What a joke. corruption to the core.
1542788910409722,22:40,Aidan Bain,one snake two heads
1542788911041917,22:41,Zeno of Elea,@Thato M How should he have responded? He said he has reviewed what he has been given and ruled accordingly. He said if there is more info he will readdress.
1542788941222975,23:11,Thato M,@Zeno of Elea Zondo's response on the matter will draw him unnecessary criticism. Zondo took sides of the lead investigator without allowing the complainant to fully ventilate their concerns
1542788959440962,23:29,Prescott Smith's Fly Fishing Academy,blacks all over the world are paying attention to what is happening in South Africa and the continent.
1542788986041387,23:56,Lucky Dlamini,He tries to teach Judge Zondo some English too.
1542788990978306,24:01,Get Up Stand Up South Africa,"The Sun üåû does not hide behind the Clouds ‚õÖÔ∏è forever someday it will come out , just like the truth, we need to make SA better"
1542788993295449,24:03,Zeno of Elea,@Thato M that is not true. He ruled after getting both sides and said he will reconsider if more evidence is brought forth.
1542788996739786,24:06,Nelson Musoliwa,Pravin seem to be avoiding to be cross examined by not implicating anyone but state affairs as they were.He is economical with the truth thus far until proven otherwise
1542789003962026,24:14,Singi Mathebula,The devil you know is better than the devil you do not know. I vote ANC.
1542789006906320,24:17,Thato M,"@Zeno of Elea our Constitution requires evidence to be led on both sides of the plaintiff and defendant, what Zondo did was tea party with this lead investigator"
1542789012128526,24:22,Sthakathi Khumalo,Prescott Smith and what are white people doing??? Continuing with colonizing the continent??
1542789032067023,24:42,Kabelo Mohlamme,@Prescott Smith who are blacks?
1542789034549217,24:44,benjamin Maluleke manyunyu,the mandate of Gordhan is to tries all by means to implicate JZ and this strategy is not going to work since judiciary inquiry relies on the principle of res ipsa loquitor.
1542789041275419,24:51,Thato M,"@Zeno of Elea which evidence was led, what evidence did Adv Pretorius supply?"
1542789043532894,24:53,Sthakathi Khumalo,You cant implicate people with smoke guns hebana!
1542789046374680,24:56,Zeno of Elea,@Thato M this is not a court case. It is an inquiry. Findings from this might lead to legal action
1542789058320292,25:08,Aidan Bain,"when you look at how the parties act , i am in the belief that they have lost reality of south africans,"
1542789061808608,25:12,THABISO MOGORU,PG FACTION IN THE ANC WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING
1542789063351897,25:13,Aidan Bain,"they act and speak about the country as if it was ten years ago , the parties are more racist themselves than the normal man on the street"
1542789069024534,25:19,Wesley M,the ANC is broken into pieces. But who do we vote for????
1542789075508926,25:25,Thato M,@Zeno of Elea what are you saying? An inquiry is a rugby game to you
1542789076061346,25:26,peter pott,"the presidency , differs from zwane statement. lol. Pravin remain quite, because he doesn't want to give fmr president credit.‚ò∫‚ò∫"
1542789090162294,25:40,dave east,guys we need to do research before we listen to people
1542789099653115,25:49,Zeno of Elea,@Thato M I do not follow - re the ref to rugby
1542789135489357,26:25,Khalid Mather,"so there is some truth to the whole Defending the capitalist agenda, although race has no part in it apart from dominance"
1542789151459999,26:41,Thato M,"@Zeno of Elea I also do not follow your logic on the legalities (oaths, etc) surrounding an Inquiry you claim aren't based on statutes?"
1542789182650880,27:12,Sthakathi Khumalo,"This state capture report, why cant Queen Thuli bring her side of evidence really??"
1542789182946477,27:12,dave east,guys the IMF has warned against expropriation of land without compensation.
1542789199751635,27:30,Thato M,"This man is pap, energy is down, tone is soft. He's taken a toll"
1542789204145469,27:34,Zeno of Elea,@Thato M this is an inquiry. Kind of like a grand jury in the states or other inquiries around the world. The investigate if there are grounds for legal action.
1542789224021982,27:54,Sthakathi Khumalo,dave east IMF must go to sleep we are expropriating land
1542789253583849,28:24,Zeno of Elea,"@Thato M If there are grounds to bring charges, then the defendants can have evidence leads"
1542789269294589,28:39,dave east,the IMF is a white institution that lends money and is against land expropriation in South Africa
1542789273952500,28:44,Thato M,"@Zeno of Elea thanks for the unsolicited legal treatise. Make your point then, these matters you raise aren't in dispute"
1542789324127171,29:32,Zeno of Elea,@Thato M I am trying to understand your position. Are you saying this is not a legitimate process?
1542789326826927,29:37,Khalid Mather,"exactly @dave east , the IMF are publicly announcing their influence, with the ultimate aim for SA to require a loan from them"
1542789403275251,30:53,Frans Phala,"is it possible that pravin testimony is the same story, the cross examining is rehassed for the answer given compared to the other witnesses who took the stand ?"
1542789436571997,31:27,Thato M,"@Zeno of Elea going circles. I was simply pointing out his hypocrisy in dealing with those alleged to have done wrong & how media runs with that narrative, without affording others the same treatment"
1542789444534784,31:34,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Frans Phala Intresting point, I have a strong feeling that may be exact hmm"
1542789464679584,31:54,dave east,yes Khalid
1542789482238583,32:12,Zeno of Elea,@Thato M I see. I misunderstood you then. I thought you had a problem with the process. Sorry
1542789490037486,32:20,Thato M,"Mpofu will take him to taks, esp on the SARs rogue unit."
1542789500174734,32:30,Lucky Dlamini,Just wondering how Solly Mapaila st al plan to defend PG if they are not standing against BLF and EFF publicly.
1542789500936613,32:31,Thato M,@Zeno of Elea no stress.
1542789522970544,32:53,Aidan Bain,i wonder if the KPMG report will ring some truth regarding sars

1542789573568086,33:43,dave east,a group named the free market found ation was founded in 1975 by 6 white men has said expropriation of land without compensation should not go forward

1542789728331917,36:18,Joel Mkunqwana,Gordhan now goes into the heart of Zwane' shenanigans - the man should have long been in orange uniform by now....
1542789738748459,36:29,Thato M,This man is on his way out. He will prove to costly for the ANC in the upcoming elections. His daughter Anisha and uncle Ketso Gordhan business dealings will be his albatross.

1542789822149019,37:52,Thato M,He knows branches and structures of the ANC will be meeting to deal decisively with these matters and calling for the ANC Intergrity commission to investigate while he recuses himself. Days numbered

1542790611304087,51:01,Speckled Trim,Why you think Hartbeespoort dam is dying?

1542790731478913,53:01,Percy letsoalo,The commission does not have the teeth to bite therefore this process is a waste of state resource and taxpayers money. Let's allow the law enforcement agencies to execute their mandate.
1542790735431839,53:05,dave east,guys this advocate is close to pravin i just researched it malema is right
1542790739608378,53:09,Speckled Trim,The water is connected underground. once its contaminated a name change wont fix anything
1542790800538666,54:10,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,Molefe knew something about Nuclear funding. He was clearly targeted. So sad the country missed out on a 9.6 megawatt electricity plant. It would have paid itself out over 20-30 years
1542790812123064,54:22,Knight Wolves United FC,But otherwise they have improved South Azania economy during their reign in government state
1542790812802587,54:23,peter pott,"challenge is that setting up nuclear will take bread of the table of minority coal mine owners, who are fighting even this day in courts for price manipulation"
1542790878782942,55:29,Knight Wolves United FC,2010 has bring lot of corruption in STATE
1542790895899470,55:46,peter pott,"but he was not in cabinet on 9 December 2018, he can't speak on its behalf"

1542790932790922,56:23,Speckled Trim,South Africa will industrialize further because of joblessness. Factory workers and unions are here to stay.
1542790939040766,56:29,Trucker Trucker,Molefe should apply to question Pravin and to give testimony. His view on nuclear is interesting. Pravin says Molefe could be right because he was schooled by Manuel & RamosüòÇ.
1542790962204232,56:52,Thato M,"@Louis Eloff will lead to a mass exodus, leading properties to being sold without a demand thereby reducing the prices & allowing new owners. Then deal with the dam when demographics have improved"
1542790982316772,57:11,Khalid Mather,"How could it be self funding though , thats the only thing, I have become much more open to Nuclear, but not through Gupta"
1542791007219069,57:37,Mogamat Allie,this is a waste of time....TRC .....da wil com
1542791040599508,58:10,Speckled Trim,There's a lot of health concerns in that area. just Google it you will see. nuclear damage cant be fixed

1542791047209523,58:17,Zeno of Elea,@Trucker I guess that is one view.
1542791048370408,58:18,peter pott,"@nkutha, PG is addressing press conference here in the last three days"
1542791051109025,58:21,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,"If there were no funding models finalised for the nuclear build, where did Nene get the strong idea that it was unaffordable. Molefe seemed to think some kind of PPP could work."
1542791069385206,58:39,Siala Lucky,PG just stop wasting people timeüòèüòè‚úã
1542791074020707,58:44,Thato M,@Louis Eloff so what needs to happen then?

1542791113838972,59:24,Khalid Mather,@em D but that would mean we should allow a private company to build a nuclear power station here and sell that power to the state...(grand scheme)
1542791117728254,59:28,Jomoh Khanyile,PG really is waisting our timeüòè

1542791168409669,1:00:18,Khalid Mather,"@Thando Nkutha I think we are getting close to a hydrogen energy matrix soon too, that could be better than Nuclear. SA is one of the best locations for Power Fuels"
1542791181877170,1:00:32,Thato M,@Thando Nkutha absolutely
1542791204341371,1:00:54,Sthakathi Khumalo,"I wonder why SANs are anti Nuclear energy, there are a wide range of benefits here, among others; reduction of carbon footprints i.e fossil fuels, raw material use and transport etc."
1542791205801202,1:00:55,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Apart from difficulties in managing nuclear waste and terrorist friendly, this could easily reduce the stress on oil and other fuel intakes.. We could even eliminate cost plus mines."

1542791285958407,1:02:16,Khalid Mather,"@Sthakathi Khumalo in the new stations there is no considerations for even weaponizing the waste, because its not uranium. The waste can even be converted to other forms of energy nowawdays."
1542791288309100,1:02:18,Kevin Davis,khumalo you shud.get a job in the London palladium telling jokes

1542792057888759,1:15:07,Thato M,"@Kevin Davis time wasting. I'll tell you fro free, none of the emails you are basing your thesis on will be used by Zondo. A commission cannot legally use leaked & unauthenticated emails."
1542792084635706,1:15:34,Thato M,@Kevin Davis therefore your argument and rationale falls flat.
1542792087051521,1:15:37,Trucker Trucker,Over 8 departments already confirm to have given Pravin‚Äôs companies tenders since 2009 when he was Finance Minister.

1542792169850745,1:17:00,Mosimanegape Michael,zondo he is wasting time and gov resources wen this will end let the thief rot in jail finish
1542792171444160,1:17:01,david jacobs,I think this should have been dealt with in court
1542792187168904,1:17:17,Kevin Davis,if nobody does then the material.is regarded as correct hope that explains that

1542792456879063,1:21:45,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,This commission is a COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. It is serving it's intended purpose. That's why a whole full grown minister can wave a two page fake Intel Report in front of a judge. Its so shameful
1542792470863356,1:22:00,Walter Spatula,@Trucker There are no real sources for fake news. That's why it's fake...

1542795941259233,2:19:51,Nelson Musoliwa,The ANC failed to prevent state looting because it was divided and senior members were directly involved esp the head zuma with guptas. The aim was no more transformation but personal gain

1542796091868880,2:22:21,Mpho Mashigo,yey... Pravin fired Dudu Mnyeni for telling the truth in the SAA enquiry... she said Pravin has shares at Bidvest and it's a supplier to SAA making billions a month at SAA
1542796093411368,2:22:23,Wilhelm5381,and the Indians improved their lot considerably since then... per capita they are the wealthiest people in SA despite apartheid.

1542796119663764,2:22:49,Nelson Musoliwa,But why do not we hear just one instance where Pravin warned or acted against state capture within ANC stages at all. Why is it not because he was also its role player as well
