1596543083738768,6:52,Carl Botha,"All over the news, you all of a sudden see more corruption and cheap stuff that taxpayer paid for"
1596543145820104,7:53,Pastor J.J,@Carl...These skelms in charge will steal flowers at their own funeral
1596543156715896,8:05,Elvis Malakoane,Carl Botha looks like we have a new corruption pandemic with Covid19 PPE
1596543172631203,8:21,Jenny Whitewaves,I think the sudden interest by ANC in investigating corruption is linked to getting the IMF money
1596543249424691,9:37,Jenny Whitewaves,Will be just enough to get the bankers off their back but no real high up who have stolen the big money will ever answer
1596543282389432,10:10,Carl Botha,Just saw the Car Park field Hospital and the shacks that was built in Limpopo 🤔
1596543321591283,10:50,Naledi Barron,"Hi @Pastor J, and @Pienaar van Wyk."

1596543700991703,17:09,Naledi Barron,"YES ! @Pastor J . Unfortunately corruption is endemic in many 1st and 3td world countries. S.A is not unique, but at least we have SOME form of democratic public inquiry!"
1596543804508470,18:52,Pastor J.J,@Naledi...We certainly have more liberties and we scream from the highest rooftops. Sadly most times when corruption is endemic by the ruling party members nobody seems to listen.Arrests must happen
1596543862849169,19:51,Naledi Barron,"@Pastor J. I hear you, and I agree. It is very sad that justice turns so slowly!"
1596543920018656,20:48,Pastor J.J,If the Asset Forfeiture Unit has sufficient grounds to go for the Eskom Officials and Gupta assets why has the NPA fallen short to do a few arrests?
