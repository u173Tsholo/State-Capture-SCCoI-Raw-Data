1550658458077824,2:24:08,Talent P Sibisi,@Joel Mzayidume yes Sir
1550658491381841,2:24:40,Felix Muyoba,@Joel Mzayidume disagree..no problem with anc but individuals..
1550658534389450,2:25:24,Buhle Ntombela,"The first president of the ANC is from KZN Chief Abert, John Langalibalele Dube Prixley ka"
1550658551889580,2:25:40,Joel Mzayidume,"@Felix Muyoba , any organisation that gives equal chance for scum or talent to rise to the top is dysfunctional"
1550658606594838,2:26:36,Felix Muyoba,@Joel Mzayidume but it is the people themselves who are making it dysfunctional and not itself
1550658641854311,2:27:11,Joel Mzayidume,of course an organisation is made up of people.
1550658652186116,2:27:21,Jngle Pssy,Poor South Africa ...
1550658692127803,2:28:01,Felix Muyoba,@Joel Mzayidume so the individuals are the problem not anc
1550658770309808,2:29:19,Norman Zwane,@Felix Muyoba Very neat argument but I think @Joel Mzayidume is responding fairly - the people make up the orgabisation. Mina I supported the ANC & Zuma. I regret it bitterly.

1550658894871968,2:31:24,Thulani Bukani,@joel. That’s true. Zuma and Cyril are not the problem. ANC itself is a corrupt and deceitful criminal organization. That I have thought for many years. But Agrizzi confirmed it for me.
