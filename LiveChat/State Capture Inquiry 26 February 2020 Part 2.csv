1582719286283919,6:52,Granny Mokwena,who's the evidence leader? and the witness?
1582719329657104,7:35,Pastor J.J,Adv Nicholson for the Commission and Col Du Plooy from the Hawks
1582719507981412,10:34,Granny Mokwena,thanks pastor j
1582719643242853,12:48,Anne M.,Hello @Pastor J . I decided not to follow the budget speech and just read a summary later. Are you doing the same?
1582719714348095,14:00,Pastor J.J,Absolutely @Anne M. .This evidence has far reaching implications on the KZN ANC Leadersip and the NPA in KZN
1582720150596797,21:16,Granny Mokwena,PwC that gave SAA clean questionable audits for 5 years.mmm
1582720214184109,22:20,Pastor J.J,The Integrity of these Audit companies depended on who paid the Highest price@Granny Mokwena .
1582720506072679,27:11,Anne M.,"It should mandatory that auditors have to be changed every 3 years. Audit firms want the work, and I think it sometimes results in them not wanting to upset the apple cart, losing fees."
1582720686499018,30:12,Pastor J.J,"They are the watchdogs that should police integrity,honesty and all those things. But, when their activities are dependent on contracts and its associated values then that is simple greed @Anne M."
