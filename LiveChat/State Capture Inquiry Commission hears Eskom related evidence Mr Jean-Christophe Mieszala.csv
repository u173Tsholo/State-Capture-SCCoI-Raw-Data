1607604323697214,4:37:18,Mike Newlands,@Calvin Ndavheleseni Sadly not. The evidence is there but we have no independant police agencies they all report to the corrupt head of the ANC Pres.CR.The ANC will not lock themselves up!
1607604329281787,4:37:24,Louis C,Inspector Clouseau is waffling
1607604336775752,4:37:31,Dominic Przybylski,@Sekgololo Johannes Exactly. Politicians are only interested in power and will lie in any way if it helps them to get it.
1607604345110653,4:37:39,Sekgololo Johannes,"@Rahab Takalo Cyril will not have much to say, in my view. As a Deputy President the Constitution doe snot give him specific duties and powers. The DP position is just ornamental."
1607604360371305,4:37:54,Sekgololo Johannes,You only do what the President pass to you.
1607604370777278,4:38:05,Diane Louw,misunderstandings hahahah

1607604440353146,4:39:16,Dominic Przybylski,The man worked so hard to 'look the other way' that he was 'shocked' by hearing about the corruption that was old news to just about everyone else in the country.
1607604449433882,4:39:24,Rahab Takalo,"the Deputy President then become redundant, all power lies eith the President shame a rubber stamp"

1607604482765840,4:39:57,Sekgololo Johannes,@Rahab Takalo that is the starting point. The DP position is just ornamental like a flower.

1607608038929408,5:39:13,Louis C,@Goat - Wow they really were mean to you! Why only you?
1607608052657328,5:39:28,SanFran Arnold,"@John Everitt the monies will not be recouped. Most out of country and the rest they spent on cars and houses, depreciating assets"
1607608081347404,5:39:57,Naledi Barron,"@Goat - Still about the capture of Eskom and Transnet vis a vis Regiments, Trilion, McKinsey and other Gupta-controlled entities..."

1607608202309168,5:41:57,Ndivhuwo Sivhula,LOL the questions were getting rough and the connection took the hit
1607608210776839,5:42:05,Goat -,@Louis C - Being black my friend. The lady who orchestrated this used to wear mini skirts in the office and I criticized a celebrity who wore revealing outfits in public so she took it personal.
1607608239730208,5:42:33,Sanjay Maharaj,"@sanfran, because consultants are trained to observe, make finding and recommend. employees are employed to do the work."
1607608243036835,5:42:37,MIKE DURBAN,@SanFran Arnold ...Spot on.........you hit the nail right on the head..........

1607608272217543,5:43:07,Naledi Barron,Zoom times out after about 45 mins. Why not use SKYPE ffs??
1607608285216826,5:43:19,Diane Louw,wonder how much the zoom meetings are costing us...
1607608295966384,5:43:30,Goat -,@Naledi Barron - Thanks for me filling me in. Any idea when Zuma will be brought back to testify?
1607608298403183,5:43:33,Louis C,@Goat - Now I understand. Mini skirts can be very distracting
1607608324298631,5:43:58,Sifiso C Myeni,I've seen this business consulting nonsense even in the private sector - adds no value
1607608327781771,5:44:01,SanFran Arnold,"@Sanjay Maharaj the company needs to have the ""capacity"" and ability to handle business. It is a new age thing to subcontract your core functionality to outsiders. LOOTING MUCH!!!"
1607608368456044,5:44:42,Antoinette Meyer,i use google meet with my students
1607608368665357,5:44:42,Heather Durr,Sexism needs to raise its profile I abhor it
1607608379823502,5:44:55,Louis C,@Goat - But you've toned it down a lot. You sure you're okay?
1607608381431268,5:44:56,Antoinette Meyer,works well
1607608393087298,5:45:07,Sanjay Maharaj,"@sanfran, not so a much a new age thing than a new world. consultants are meant to make a company more competitive and solid"

1607608450378007,5:46:05,Lerato Moleke,"@Sifiso, so true it's a looting mechanism with airy fairy expected outcomes"
1607608464885594,5:46:19,Goat -,@Louis C - No bro. I am struggling. Most of the time I was misbehaving as a way of trying to cope with my situation.
1607608486301242,5:46:41,SanFran Arnold,@Sanjay Maharaj I understand the concept but it is being fleeced. I do not believe that SOE's needed these consultants as I clearly shown by the evidence. It proves that we were hiring wrong people
1607608505407114,5:47:00,Sanjay Maharaj,"@nema, true. but th industry has become so that idiot organizations employ consultants for years and years on end to do the same thing. or rather drag it out"
1607608516355955,5:47:10,Naledi Barron,"How many times, as a Sout African Consultant (and part of BEE and BBEE), I amd my team had to sort out the gemors left my ""international"" consultants!!"

1607608559872343,5:47:54,Goat -,@Naledi Barron - Lol every one is waiting for that day. I have just read on twitter that his lawyer has also been reported to some committee for displaying contempt towards the commision.
1607608561212639,5:47:55,Antoinette Meyer,meanwhile we live amongst a braindrain
1607608574180273,5:48:08,Sanjay Maharaj,"@sanfran, on that I agree. however, it is wrong to debase the entire consultancy business. I was one for 15 years. never took a cent I was not owed."
1607608587832952,5:48:22,SanFran Arnold,@Antoinette Meyer totally
1607608617612697,5:48:52,Goat -,@SanFran Arnold - You are showing me me no love..

1607611807461499,6:07:12,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Shari Mattera Battle ground states have been sued at SCOTUS and SCOTED ha given them until today to respond. This is epic. US constitution mandates state legislatures the dutyto nominate delegates.
1607611812209361,6:07:17,SanFran Arnold,Oh you cant hear when Adv. C corners you
1607611818810545,6:07:24,Angelo Doubel,@ Anti Suz I am asking a question?

1607611914067030,6:08:59,Shari Mattera,@Aubrey De Bliquy - Yes i would expect delegates to be named on time..but with the chaos pre-during and post elections...its best for me to just watch.
