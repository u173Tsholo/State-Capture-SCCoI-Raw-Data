1607608210776839,5:42:05,Goat -,@Louis C - Being black my friend. The lady who orchestrated this used to wear mini skirts in the office and I criticized a celebrity who wore revealing outfits in public so she took it personal.
1607608239730208,5:42:33,Sanjay Maharaj,"@sanfran, because consultants are trained to observe, make finding and recommend. employees are employed to do the work."

1607608298403183,5:43:33,Louis C,@Goat - Now I understand. Mini skirts can be very distracting
1607608324298631,5:43:58,Sifiso C Myeni,I've seen this business consulting nonsense even in the private sector - adds no value
1607608327781771,5:44:01,SanFran Arnold,"@Sanjay Maharaj the company needs to have the ""capacity"" and ability to handle business. It is a new age thing to subcontract your core functionality to outsiders. LOOTING MUCH!!!"

1607608486301242,5:46:41,SanFran Arnold,@Sanjay Maharaj I understand the concept but it is being fleeced. I do not believe that SOE's needed these consultants as I clearly shown by the evidence. It proves that we were hiring wrong people
1607608505407114,5:47:00,Sanjay Maharaj,"@nema, true. but th industry has become so that idiot organizations employ consultants for years and years on end to do the same thing. or rather drag it out"

1607608574180273,5:48:08,Sanjay Maharaj,"@sanfran, on that I agree. however, it is wrong to debase the entire consultancy business. I was one for 15 years. never took a cent I was not owed."
