1551176222346644,2:16:54,Makwa Choma,That day is when elections are going to rigged n people are going to killed because ANC WILL not want to leave power like ZANU PF
1551176272858516,2:17:44,Benny Bala,@Michael Michael Ramaphosa is cleaning nothing. The ANC initially was opposed to this commission but the EFF demanded it.
1551176287380026,2:17:58,Phyllis Kumalo,Cleaning what of he was part of it @Michael Michael
1551176298642070,2:18:09,Bridgette Kekana,our last hope on CR
1551176300120421,2:18:11,Derek Main,"@Michael Michael I agree he's instituted some commissions of inquiry - some he was forced to by the PP and court cases but until the guilty go to jail, nothing has changed. Just more empty promises"
1551176315436190,2:18:26,Jack Sparrow,@Benny Bala The EFF make loads of demands that don't come to anything
1551176334337185,2:18:45,Makwa Choma,There are only two parties now in South Africa that we need to test DA AND EFF
1551176357986036,2:19:09,Benny Bala,@ Jack Sparrow I beg to differ.
1551176388460119,2:19:40,Phyllis Kumalo,Where was CR in 9 years back @Bridgeett
1551176419537369,2:20:10,Anne M.,"@Thando Nkutha Yes, I find it interesting listening to experts who can explain things"
1551176435726845,2:20:27,Benny Bala,@Phyllis Kumalo He was right there.
1551176442836984,2:20:34,Bridgette Kekana,he was part of 9 wasted yrs
1551176474955689,2:21:06,Michael Michael,Phyliss he waz powerless over powered
1551176488074923,2:21:19,Phyllis Kumalo,So what is he cleaning if i may ask
1551176530449719,2:22:01,Bridgette Kekana,he is cleaning corruption
1551176537538323,2:22:08,Desmond Masilela,What type of coal was Gupta supplied to Eskom? was it fake coal or what?
1551176539761208,2:22:11,Makwa Choma,"ANC killed n milked Escom now they come we solutions which they think we must trust them with Unbundling of Escom,what is their intention to finish it off now"

1551176592277456,2:23:03,Phyllis Kumalo,So hw was out of corruption that he saw was happening nd keep quit
1551176608393958,2:23:19,Anne M.,@Desmond Masilela Bad coal that wasn't up to the standard needed by the power stations
1551176612702444,2:23:24,Michael Michael,Coals the lowest grade.
1551176619444152,2:23:30,Benny Bala,@Phyllis Kumalo He pretended to be ball watching yet he had a few touches on the ball. Including heel extensions.
1551176641305957,2:23:52,Derek Main,"@makhosi nobhatyi Why not leave them? They are just a political party - if they stuff up, you vote for someone else - simple"
1551176662835752,2:24:14,Makwa Choma,Makhosi stop talking about history PAC N AZAPO also fought for our liberation if we need to reward ANC LETS THINK of others
1551176680428531,2:24:32,Phyllis Kumalo,So bcos the media say nothing about him nd u bleave that
1551176700974543,2:24:52,Desmond Masilela,@Anne M. @Michael Michael . No wonder we had load-shedding.

1551176748741405,2:25:40,Benny Bala,@ Jack Sparrow EFF forced the ANC to speak about land expropriation without compensation which the ANC strongly rejected. Now it's going to happen. Major turn around.
1551176764520041,2:25:56,Michael Michael,useless coal
1551176808635308,2:26:40,Jack Sparrow,"@Benny Bala ...and the EFF demand nationalisation of land, which isn't going to happen. Point is the EFF demand a lot - perhaps way too much"

1551177002026418,2:29:53,Jack Sparrow,@Benny Bala Don't get me wrong - I'd like to see a lot of changes. But the EFF should be more careful not to expend their political capital wtih crazy demands
1551177003354498,2:29:55,Benny Bala,"@Jack Sparrow If expropriation of land won't change the Black man's life, then why is it such a BIG DEAL? Not to."

1551177939761930,2:45:31,Sofia Sofia,@rohan barnard i learnt more from this
1551177969752919,2:46:00,Sofia Sofia,"Plants and other life forms, after their death, drifted down to the bottom of the swamps, where they were compressed and decomposed to form peat."
1551177971668293,2:46:02,Sofia Sofia,"Coal was formed due to the compression of the peat at high temperature and pressure. As coal was formed from the remains of vegetation, it is also called a fossil fuel."

1551178084957247,2:47:56,Sofia Sofia,This means that there is enough coal to last us around 150 years at current rates of production.
1551178120026692,2:48:30,Desmond Masilela,I like this Adv she's so organized
1551178148976919,2:48:59,rohan barnard,Eskom relies on coal fired power stations to produce approximately 90% of its electricity. Eskom uses over 90 million tons of coal per annum.
1551178174101752,2:49:25,rohan barnard,@Desmond Masilela I can agree with you on this adv. She is organised
1551178238267018,2:50:30,Sofia Sofia,"Coal is a non-renewable fossil fuel that is combusted and used to generate electricity Because coal takes millions of yrs to develop and there is a limited amount of it, it is a nonrenewable resource."

1551178443130582,2:53:54,rohan barnard,Are they transferring that money to the municipality? Are the municipalities paying Eskom? Sure doesn't seem like it
