1552392560076738,5:20,Anne M.,This witness is not well prepared. How many times has he been told to find out things and provide information to the commission?
1552392694746010,7:35,Bridgette Kekana,hello
1552392752683043,8:32,Anne M.,@Thando Nkutha A simple question of whether or not they had an overdraft?
1552392767469411,8:47,Bridgette Kekana,eish ran out og data
1552392805939557,9:26,Anne M.,@Thando Nkutha Correct and a lot of the information is in the public domain
1552392868355571,10:28,Magda Seguin,@Anne M.
1552392898936991,10:59,Magda Seguin,True..They were indicted in 2018
1552392962847847,12:03,Magda Seguin,There were 3 directors at Regiments Capital
1552393118638845,14:39,Anne M.,Agree - they were selective about who they checked. My bank wouldn't release my bonus until they received confirmation from my employer that it was genuine transaction.
1552393469043341,20:29,Wildthing,why has Salim not been arrested already
1552393693207125,24:13,Johnny Cash,‚úäüèøeff
1552393699281934,24:19,welton paulse,i think the government should give tax payers to option to claim their tax back from the Guptas and BOSASA
1552393734841485,24:56,Johnny Cash,Never ever again in my lifetime will we be colonised by Indians ‚úäüèøeff
1552393741025173,25:01,Anne M.,"@Thando Nkutha Yup, our tax money used to fatten their bank accounts, resulting in less money available for health, education etc."
1552393750038842,25:10,Johnny Cash,Nationalise eskom ‚úäüèøeff
1552393764011220,25:24,Margareth Waterboer,The chat is more intelligent and on point today. Thx guys.. I blocked those persons yesterday who came to talk rubbish on here..
1552393778404064,25:38,Anne M.,@welton paulse üòÉ I like your thinking - if only it were possible
1552393888257817,27:29,Margareth Waterboer,But I notice another opportunistic person here now to promote a certain party. Let's discuss hat we HEAR about the evidence...
1552393928789204,28:09,Anne M.,@Thando Nkutha And that's where I start to get seriously p-d off.
1552393970492265,28:51,Desmond Masilela,Ghost employees here
1552393988883894,29:09,Sebation Nantsika,The only way to fight this battle is move fast to government institutions because of those who were following Z stl using government resources to fight the current President especially treasury
1552394013920824,29:34,Margareth Waterboer,Millions always. We hve been robbed of billions to these thieves..
1552394232279924,33:12,welton paulse,it is really sad to see how our beautiful country has become a place where outsiders can just come and do as they please. From the Guptas to false pastors and the government is not doing anything
1552394307430960,34:27,Margareth Waterboer,@wetton paulse But they want our votes
1552394328471558,34:48,makhosi nobhatyi,"Hey who is this Salim Issa ? Tjooo he is dangerous, his name appears everywhere state capture, Eskom and trans net"
1552394360987909,35:21,welton paulse,@Margareth Waterboer precisely
1552394427883454,36:27,Felix Muyoba,@welton paulse true..imagine a pastor raising a person here but ebola is killing his people there in drc but he doesnt go and raise them
1552394444576631,36:44,R R,makhosi nobhatyi he worked for the gupta's
1552394447810276,36:48,Wildthing,he is buddies with Koko and other ANC members. like the guy that visited the Shabeen.
1552394509070321,37:49,Margareth Waterboer,@ makhosi nobhatyi Essa is the Gupta''s state capture engineer... He ran Eskom from outside as we heard..
1552394524162187,38:04,welton paulse,"@Felix Muyoba, it is a disgrace. Government is leaving its citizens open and exposed to these elements, which can never be aceptable."
1552394605736840,39:25,Felix Muyoba,@welton paulse is like these black magicians who tell people that he will make them rich but they themselves are walloping in poverty..thats bull!
1552394614770107,39:35,welton paulse,"After all is said and done, i just feel that Government owes its citizens an apology and an explanation for this mess."
1552394659547060,40:19,welton paulse,"@Felix Muyoba, True that very very true"
1552394663742301,40:24,MIKE DURBAN,aAnd get back the money...but not from us...i rackon
1552394668103270,40:29,makhosi nobhatyi,Please Batoi must connect the dots and arrest this old man running a country like this like a spaza is shame to us as black
1552394684543739,40:45,Anne M.,"@welton paulse Yes, because government is the custodian of our money. Hopefully, the commission will hand down a long list of people for the NPA to prosecute."
1552394737991243,41:38,Desmond Masilela,"These ppl knew what they where doing was wrong, but they still keep on doing it."
1552394747311478,41:47,Anne M.,@Thando Nkutha In Dubai wasn't it?
1552394751858626,41:51,Ndidendavela Nam Bathembu Mgudlwa,How can I block the annoying adverts from popping up on my screen
1552394764737726,42:05,Wildthing,agree
1552394788519028,42:28,Buyiswa Mnyani,"@makhosi nobhatyi , Lynn Brown was mentioned by Mr Tsotsi that she and Salim Issa said that. When Lynn was asked who's Salim, she said that she has neva met with him. yet he bought her galfrend a SUV."
1552394788648950,42:29,MIKE DURBAN,@makhosi nobhatyi .....Bra....corruption knows no colour.....

1552394797752065,42:38,makhosi nobhatyi,Next month Gupta whistle blower is coming back to the country after 2 years disclosure disappeared
1552394842136372,43:23,welton paulse,"I dont understand this whole process. for if you fail to pay a traffic fine of R500, you will get treatment equal to that of criminals, but here billions disappeared and nothing seriously gets done"
1552394857021659,43:37,Anne M.,@Ndidendavela Mgudlwa I'm not sure but I have subscribed to SABC Digital News and don't get adverts. Maybe that's what you need to do.
1552394868150429,43:48,Desmond Masilela,@Felix Muyoba. Then we not going to feel sympathy for them. They must eat it now.
1552394899847506,44:20,Desmond Masilela,NOw they tell us I can not recall that. That what they telling us.
1552394940413839,45:00,Margareth Waterboer,@Wetton Paulse It's because Zuma was key to the Guptas that's why nothing happened...
1552394961913325,45:22,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Buyiswa Mnyani she was instructed Tjooo they are sellout, Zuma whatever twitted now on won‚Äôt make any sense he was a giant who controls his cabinet hidden from Anc headquarters"

1552395056413429,46:57,makhosi nobhatyi,"I always said Zuma, took Nkandla money to himself we must investigate and bring back the money 7 million he pay is not enough"

1552395133548628,48:13,Desmond Masilela,"@welton paulse. You right, the fact is this witness will be scared to divulge more info to us. Because they might think that they will be arrested."

1552400150313915,2:11:50,Eslon Eslon,So the Guptas was heavily involved in money laundering?
1552400174452748,2:12:15,Wildthing,it will be the same way they trace the VBS money movements. cant hide it. R1 is R1 it does not disappear when moved around it leaves a breadcrumb trail. just need to follow it.

1552400243285958,2:13:23,Wildthing,yes Eslon who in this world can pay cash for a $46.000.000 house in Dubai. where did that money come from.
1552400243884360,2:13:24,marks mokwena,More than involved and banks since 2009 had an international mandate to Reg flag money laundering. So the question will be who was the inside man at the reserve bank?
1552400289676292,2:14:10,Wildthing,it's a Gupta company
1552400293702693,2:14:14,Eslon Eslon,who's cutting edge?
1552400309206310,2:14:29,WorldofTanksRaw,Choosing people for positions based on race rather than merit was always gonna end badly for Eishkom.

1552400974575513,2:25:35,Eslon Eslon,So R 50 000 000 could be transferred in one day and reserve bank will not raise red flag. like really? This thing is really deep
1552401033399883,2:26:33,Anne M.,"@Eslon Eslon If it was between SA bank accounts, then I don't think the Reserve Bank gets involved. I think they only get involved when money is transferred out of the country."

1552401375635522,2:32:15,Eslon Eslon,@Anne M. Are you saying the reserve bank can't monitor transactions between local banks?

1552402279943287,2:47:19,Kapn Krunch,it's not because of one man it's the party that elected that one man after he was convicted of rape
1552402307699794,2:47:47,Norman Zwane,"@Thando Nkutha Correct Nkosini - the tap was running and they also were happy to charge and ""eat"" too."
1552402329219679,2:48:09,Kapn Krunch,the man is gone that same party is still there

1552402457141620,2:50:17,Michael Michael,To me the banks are somehow to be blamed here.
1552402464557694,2:50:25,Zola Pinda,Banks have no reputation. Alway chasing the margins and bonuses for their top management.
1552402465796401,2:50:26,Kapn Krunch,when they hit us with sanctions we got stronger because they need us we dont need them
1552402484191043,2:50:44,Wildthing,Zonda needs to give instructions now not wait until the end of SC. people need to be arrested. otherwise the process will fail the same as the Banks and other areas that should have taken action.
1552402551115586,2:51:51,Michael Michael,billions were taken under their watch.yes they dint controll our money but huge amount of money ridiculous.
1552402608468008,2:52:49,Anne M.,"@Michael Wild If I remember correctly, Judge Zondo gave an instruction during the Agrizzi testimony for the commission's investigators to hand over the results to the NPA."

1552402657629068,2:53:37,Wildthing,Anne yes but still no action. we need the wheels to turn.

1552402771474511,2:55:31,Norman Zwane,@Kapn Krunch You a bigger idiot for even thinking there was a glorious past when the rand was ... who cares?
1552402800311459,2:56:00,Wildthing,or you get names faster.
1552402807724734,2:56:07,Michael Michael,like we work at this companys
1552402847104600,2:56:47,Wildthing,you going to jail for 30 years. but each name you give gets you 2 months less. the chickens will talk.
1552402853976169,2:56:54,Zola Pinda,Banks have benefited just like the audit firms. They are just being defensive because they are exposed.
1552402898641106,2:57:38,Michael Michael,Thando agree
1552402906075666,2:57:46,Kapn Krunch,no it benefitted everyone the statistics show it

1552402995712731,2:59:15,Norman Zwane,"@Luvuyo Zantsi Sorry bru, but I don't think that was glorius. There was nothing glorius about ""non-whites only"" or ""Europeans only"" even if the exchange rate was 1 for 1."
1552403000546655,2:59:20,Zola Pinda,Banks should bring back South African's money.
1552403015831547,2:59:36,Kapn Krunch,south africa is dying and if the next elections dont show a drastic change then the great exodus begins
1552403063361679,3:00:24,MIKE DURBAN,@Kapn Krunch ......things just worked for all...back then......let's face it
