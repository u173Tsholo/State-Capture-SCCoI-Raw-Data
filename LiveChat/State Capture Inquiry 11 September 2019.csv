1568189953950373,14:37,Francel van Eeden,The bigger picture regarding qualifications means only one thing. It proves that people misused their powers to apoint their friends

1568193828707457,1:19:12,gideon caldwell,He seriously intends becoming the next president... delusions of grandeur I‚Äôd say.
1568193839483769,1:19:23,Derek Main,The problem is that destruction during protests is the only thing that makes the government sit up and take notice.
1568194010220694,1:22:13,Derek Main,"@Gee Peex1 From what I've read, those attacks were on SAfns and foreigners. Of the 12 people killed in Gauteng during protests, 10 were SAfns."
1568194097768411,1:23:40,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 Exactly - so then it's no longer xenophobic - it's just plain old violence.
1568194153790159,1:24:36,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 And that's because people are frustrated - no other avenue is available to them for their grievances. It's a last resort.
1568194276584275,1:26:39,Derek Main,"@Gee Peex1 Like I've said, that's exactly what the NAT government argued. They said ""Because journalists are covering protests, people become more violent. Therefore we are banning coverage."""
1568194439947620,1:29:23,Sizwe Zuma,Our views expressed about Hlaudi are subjective to the background of what is been said about him. in search of the truth you will have to use an objective mindset.

1568194940526912,1:37:43,Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 I think you'd be hard-pressed to find many who will admit to being Nats. I disagreed with just about everything they stood for. It might explain why so many vote ANC - they are so similar.
