1568189584576465,8:28,Rox,"former SABC CEO was also not a south African, Hlaudi and his friends"
1568189587640914,8:30,Stranger House,we need a commission of enquiry about the Land that was taken from South African black people. this is a waste of time regarding Hlaudi Qualification.
1568189592151694,8:35,Francel van Eeden,@Tshwane Smoke so because of that should everyone then now be authorized to lie

1568189819762264,12:23,Augustine Mosielele,@makhosi No we didn't
1568189820555899,12:23,Rox,"I miss DJC breathing on that mic making those "" tswiiii "" sound"
1568189834029963,12:37,Glorify Gumede,@Lex Luger you must think before making such claims i know its fashionable to use big words these days just to sound smart
1568189843545815,12:46,Bernard Matolino,"@Glorify Gumede Categorising people is problematic, once it emerges that he is this -ish, then we attribute difference to the person and that is grounds for discrimination"

1568189916004470,13:59,makhosi nobhatyi,@Augustine Mosielele then we have a problem here
1568189916685788,13:59,TCM,"@Francel van Eeden, I bet u didn't know about that because there is much less attention on it when it's a white person.. there is this assumed competency/assumed qualifications when it comes to whites"
1568189927418219,14:10,Bernard Matolino,"@Glorify Gumede Shonglish is xenophobic, Zunglish is tribalistic and anything of the sort that categorises for the sake of it dehumanises and compromises the individual's integrity"
1568189953950373,14:37,Francel van Eeden,The bigger picture regarding qualifications means only one thing. It proves that people misused their powers to apoint their friends
1568189976914934,15:00,TCM,MIGHT WE ADD DA CHIEF WHIP JOHN STEENHUIZEN.. who's talking aboy him too??? why the double standards???
1568190007449950,15:30,Glorify Gumede,@Lex Luger i am of a different view and everything must be contextualised. Perhaps if you are black you will understand the word Zunglish

1568190060137036,16:23,Rox,But Hlaudi is a video by himself mos
1568190060637944,16:23,Glorify Gumede,i bet you are an armchair theorist and looking at issues from the academic point of view but that is fine

1568190110657289,17:14,TCM,THE POINT IN GENERAL IS THERE'S MUCH LESS ATTENTION ON THIS WHEN IT CONCERNS A WHITE PERSON
