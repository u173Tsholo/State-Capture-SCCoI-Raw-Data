1600858324641431,2:51:44,cassim suleman,i support death penalty..serves no purpose keeping for life
1600858355604973,2:52:15,Jacqui Baumgardt,@a b c Yes - there are some crimes that are so egregious that they deserve nothing less
1600858363277509,2:52:24,L Ll,There are always arguments for and against but in some cases death penalty is appropriate
1600858364637968,2:52:25,cassim suleman,got labour laws to prevent slavery
1600858407802672,2:53:08,Janine Arvayo,thats not True ive talked to people from Africa They believe in Honer killing s there not Americans
1600858431049833,2:53:30,Jacqui Baumgardt,@L Ll - the problem is that life is not life in SA - it's probably only about 15 years with our sloppy parole system
1600858504872168,2:54:43,L Ll,Jacqui most countries are lenient too eg England and Australia life has a min and max sentence
1600858538396843,2:55:18,L Ll,Australia is just too lenient compared to the rest of the world
1600858573061226,2:55:52,cassim suleman,the punishment is intended to be a deterrant for future such crimes..if it fails then one has to look at alternative and harsher penalties as deterrant..so one has to go the next step up..death...
1600858586076077,2:56:04,dennis oldude,LIFE SHULD MEAN EXACTLY THAT NOT WE'LL LET YOU OUT AFTER 12 YEARD IF YOU BEHAVE?
1600858592909640,2:56:12,Janine Arvayo,Justice for all means Justice for victims
1600858594187595,2:56:14,a b c,I just think that people who beg for the death penalty to be reinstated don't really know what they're asking for...
1600858594626638,2:56:14,Akhonamandla Gala,"@LowJack187 I'm very sorry the slavery you are looking for in South Africa is not there and not constitutional, go look somewhere else maybe"
1600858597881185,2:56:17,Johnno D,Can't compare. Australia have very little crime
1600858650167616,2:57:09,Inno inno,We need a similar kind of commission that would look into the former white government since it also looted and enriched the whites.
1600858671654307,2:57:33,Akhonamandla Gala,@abc indeed 👍
1600858688124884,2:57:47,Willie Truter,"We also have laws against murder,theft,corruption etc. But crime increase by the hour. Death penalty will end the life of a useless,dung, of society, in jail taxpayers must provide that useless being"
1600858692466739,2:57:54,L Ll,abc the same applies to people who want the death penalty abolished lol it just depends on your opinion lol
1600858738824213,2:58:39,a b c,@L Ll There is no current death penalty.... and it's not a matter of opinion... it's a matter of people's lives...
1600858762919206,2:59:04,cassim suleman,these criminals become a burden to society
1600858787196901,2:59:28,Janine Arvayo,Justice for all means for all victims of every race no matter what religion or Political believe each individual has
1600858787785469,2:59:28,a b c,*cases...
1600858788496825,2:59:29,L Ll,It doesn’t mean it won’t be reinstated along the way though
1600858795353002,2:59:35,Akhonamandla Gala,people must just do a thorough research and understanding about death penalty so that they can make an informed decision. for now it is not constitutional
1600858819425826,2:59:59,a b c,"It happens quite often... with a death penalty, many innocents may be executed because some chick lied to everyone..."
