1552307386193242,24:38,Felix Muyoba,@Yin Yang as soon as he discovered some anomalies at eskom he left..he is an honest citizen..
1552307530046351,27:03,Myka'Al Daud,"Rama was the chairman of MTN when Iran charged the company with corruption.....FNB,Lonmin etc etc"

1552307928270736,33:41,Derek Main,@Myka'Al Daud Don't hold your breath - IEC is compromised
1552307974357725,34:26,Felix Muyoba,@Myka'Al Daud do you think investigation can yield anything?
1552307982569959,34:35,Isihlahla Samabhinca,we are waiting for Zuma's time
1552308024405351,35:17,Myka'Al Daud,"prisoner of hope,just expose the rot.is ppl to choose who they want.knowing the truth"
1552308078837195,36:11,Myka'Al Daud,Truth shall set us free
1552308099922467,36:32,Wildthing,ANC have breached about 5 critical laws which should have them removed from taking part in voting for 8 years. until they clean up there act. and ask Venezuela to keep the MECs visiting them.
1552308150529404,37:22,Felix Muyoba,@Myka'Al Daud if the rural people were eating and drinking at an anc rally with that money from bosasa..do you think they understand that it was illegal? they dont..
1552308159565206,37:33,Myka'Al Daud,PG refuses to be cross examined by Moyane
1552308296208926,39:49,Myka'Al Daud,Is he hiding something or just enjoying his rights?
1552308307949259,40:00,Nelson Musoliwa,Do we want to believe that the entire ANC esp the NEC didn't know that the dealing with bossasa was illegal?
1552308346315228,40:39,Aadil Mohammed,"Why waist state funds on this , BOSASA boss has been charged and arrested Zuptas and cronies still parade free. Stop this farce and lock the lot up or has CR signed a secret document????"
1552308388492248,41:21,Michael Michael,I think those young educated man and woman took advantage of the fact that.the former head of state cant clearly read and understand the writings.even if down on the line we need pardon him.
1552308413745525,41:46,Felix Muyoba,@Nelson Musoliwa they knew..just ignorance..typical of african ruling parties attitude..
1552308415445645,41:48,Musa Bakiti,Let bygone be bygone and start again with EFF .Please freedom fighter beware afrikaaners.

1552308477442372,42:50,Aadil Mohammed,Michael there is no excuse if you pardon one you must pardon all. He was clever enough to defraud the state so he is eligible to stand trial and go to jail.
1552308495003404,43:07,Derek Main,"@MIKE LOCK I agree - if we want to stop the rot, we need to punish all guilty parties harshly"
1552308498828984,43:11,Myka'Al Daud,Did we pardon apartheid agents ?

1552308649523518,45:41,Derek Main,What I would like to know is if we taxpayers are going to be funding the legal defense for any of these criminals. I don't think we should.
1552308658787363,45:51,MIKE DURBAN,"@Myka'Al Daud ,,,sorry Bra...not when it comes to all of this"
1552308665977573,45:59,Musa Bakiti,We must start exporting our criminals to overseas like China export its criminals to Africa.
1552308718250504,46:50,Wildthing,Musa they put a hole in a corrupt persons head in China
1552308731454007,47:04,Myka'Al Daud,"We forgiven sellouts who wrote letters to SB,many lives were lost but we forgave...."
1552308770866815,47:43,Nelson Musoliwa,@Yin it is however difficult to believe that people who fought gallantly against oppression can do such a thing.
1552308807223259,48:20,doctor bonginkosi mnisi,all those who are implicated they must face full might of the law especial high profile leaders from ANC 70% of them are involved we also want forfeit unit

1552309153495360,54:05,Desmond Masilela,@MIKE LOCK. Now we keep on wasting time and money for this commission. Why cant they go straight to court and be prosecuted and send them to jail. This is just a wast.
1552309158687533,54:11,Felix Muyoba,@Michael Michael imagine!
1552309173188331,54:26,Nelson Musoliwa,Yang They were suffocated from the start not to develop to certain level by the regime as they were just spoon fed economically.

1552313788301298,2:11:20,Myka'Al Daud,He is capitalist in sabbathical leave

1552313840803642,2:12:12,Magda Seguin,Zuma and the SSA even tried to stop Ramaphosa's bid for ANC president.The report is in the public domain...everyone can access it.
1552313866169015,2:12:38,makhosi nobhatyi,At Songezo nqonji it is a painful one because Zuma as the president hide only Ramaphosa and Piyega who was criticized even blamed but president Zuma escaped from criticism
1552313953496214,2:14:05,Songezo Nqonji,I disagree at Derek as u said he was deputy so he was restricted u can not fight ur boss
1552313969190193,2:14:21,Myka'Al Daud,While he sat as board member FNBSA charged blacks more interests for loans
1552313980689263,2:14:32,Magda Seguin,Zuma must come clean on the murders of refugees in camps in exile...he was the head of intelligence. Ramathlodi gave a very intensive testimony here at the Commission about it.
1552314045077043,2:15:37,Derek Main,@Songezo Nqonji Why? Are you saying the deputy president has no power? As part of the cabinet and the NEC he made the decision to protect Zuma

1552314178555585,2:17:50,Mzalwane Mzala,@makhosi nobhatyi They see Ramaphosa as a threat to their political fortunes and thus they target him.
1552314223774907,2:18:36,Derek Main,Anybody from the ANC is a threat to Sa's fortunes - they have proven that and now it is all coming out
1552314238461092,2:18:51,makhosi nobhatyi,"He is defending the country from thieves, he was patient enough to wait his time to come, if he was fighting then it might be bloody cause Zuma was full force armed, he is doing the right thing"
