1582028913616563,9:22,Jacqui Baumgardt,@ERika unless they die
1582028942497695,9:51,Erika Bown,Agreed!

1582029161289121,13:29,Jie Hamilton,by information from Rose's head brain talk way

1582029392760395,17:22,Buhle Guluva,thanks
1582029464887961,18:33,Colleen Arezio,"Majola, has pulled a Zuma move. His been hospitalized due to some illness."
1582029501376743,19:10,Wildthing,he cried himself into dehydration status.
1582029608773679,20:57,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,"Excuse my poverty, but what do these people do with all this money?"
1582029627973033,21:17,Person of interest,Lol Michael😁
1582029639062126,21:27,Immanuel,jz foundation😳😳😳😳😳😳
1582029665227481,21:54,Derek Main,JZ Foundation as corrupt as the Clinton Foundation.
1582029680701685,22:08,Pheladi Lamola,I'm confused. When doing transfers don't we put in account holder and number?
1582029707147628,22:35,Erika Bown,@Pheladi Lamola I was thinking the same thing..
1582029759373108,23:28,Person of interest,We learned alot from the USA system!
1582029775651052,23:44,Simphiwo Matiso,hmmmm lying
1582029790291153,23:58,Colleen Arezio,maybe they do transfers like they do in Zim through your phone with only your cell number.
1582029790509859,23:58,Wildthing,They will retrieve the SMS's and maybe he kept all the notes he took.
1582029913573787,26:01,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,I should have worked for Mr X. I would be rich but not under the radar😋😋😋
1582029962099389,26:50,Erika Bown,Mr x was doing so well.... Now they'll start to question his credibility 😕
1582029979140411,27:08,Legae Nyalungu,secretary and daughter must be summoned ASAP
1582030047531943,28:15,Pheladi Lamola,🤣🤣🤣 Mr X
1582030049779484,28:18,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,I've also never done internet transfers. Does it require the account holder as well? Or the account number only?
1582030071898680,28:40,Erika Bown,It does require account holder
1582030072698972,28:41,Wildthing,judge just hit nail on the head with the hammer.
1582030084275008,28:52,Musa Mabunda,@CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE you can put anything on the account holder
1582030098437789,29:06,Pheladi Lamola,Yes it does require both
1582030108298244,29:16,Erika Bown,"And if the account holder and account nr don't match you won't be able to pay, as far as i know."
1582030131006519,29:40,Musa Mabunda,@Erika Bown not necessarily
1582030161737711,30:10,Musa Mabunda,"You can link two accounts, same account number different account holder"
1582030171997820,30:21,Simon Tshifhiwa Nkhumeleni,zuma name is always mention when money disappear
1582030182684157,30:31,Wildthing,maybe the secretary had a list to match account holder to account number. and would use that. she must know a lot too.
1582030191083581,30:38,Erika Bown,"@Musa Mabunda ok, thank you!"
1582030215741932,31:04,Musa Mabunda,"the system will merely alert you the account number already exists on your beneficiaries' ist, would you want to continue?"
1582030229244008,31:16,Erika Bown,"Ah ok, i see."
1582030260189600,31:48,Simon Tshifhiwa Nkhumeleni,JGZF
1582030300143704,32:28,Colleen Arezio,Mr X knows more than his saying. Nobody can have millions come and go from account not get paid and still you dont care to know anything about the sender or beneficiary. Something fishy.
1582030304563169,32:33,makhosi nobhatyi,"They share stolen money, Zuma will be very sick today"
1582030309972796,32:38,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,@Erika Bown Tx
1582030332102741,33:01,Elvis Malakoane,But did this people ever thought that all this will come out or tracible
1582030407024811,34:15,Wildthing,he would also be making interest depending how long the funds stayed in his account.
1582030439554686,34:47,makhosi nobhatyi,Zuma and Myeni was destroying mr X career and company by using his company to do money laundering 😳😳😳
1582030458725468,35:06,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,"@Musa Mabunda So it's possible that Mr Xs secretary could transfer the money without the account holder's details, only if they would have saved the account number under the beneficiaries list?"
1582030464407273,35:13,Matt Taylor,makhosi spot on!!!!
1582030481570899,35:30,cassim suleman,should do a comm of enquiry into jacob zuma trust..or banks must close account of the trust
1582030492856818,35:41,Yolo More,Mr X is intelligent.
1582030502800487,35:51,Brian Mercado,"It’s amazing how Mr. X is in charge of so much money, but h doesn’t know how to bank on the Internet? Very fishy?/"
1582030519062537,36:07,cassim suleman,y banks allowed moneys in trust
1582030531286380,36:19,Erika Bown,@Brian Mercado my thoughts exactly!
1582030532900993,36:21,Musa Mabunda,@CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE details that matter is the account number hence you can also transfers money by a cellphone number linked to the account number
1582030545020932,36:33,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,"@Brian Mercado He relied on his secretary, who happens to be his daughter"
1582030566748085,36:55,makhosi nobhatyi,🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ Zuma is evil @ Matt Tylor no one should go to support him to the court otherwise something will happen
1582030578835199,37:07,Gerda 7,Mr X was only the puppet of many strings!!
1582030590339536,37:18,Erika Bown,"But anyway, you don't need to know technology to be curious about whose account number it is."
1582030595837118,37:24,Musa Mabunda,"@Luegi Msomi it is painful indeed, not only shocking now"
1582030596370415,37:25,Wildthing,Think other people will come forward now that Mr x has given evidence opening a whole can of worms
1582030597960720,37:26,Elvis Malakoane,Michael wild can u and I open a consortium and start doing some shaddy deals looks like they are fast
1582030637425232,38:05,cassim suleman,mr X had fallout with Myeni😯😯😯😯
1582030654641420,38:23,Wildthing,Elvis not thanks I like to sleep well at night knowing I have not robbed from others. Thanks
1582030696315768,39:04,Brian Mercado,"Well if you rely on your daughter, surely you check that your daughter has made the correct transaction. This stinks. He should be blushing with guilt"
1582030718218591,39:26,cassim suleman,ZUMA IS EVIL!!!!! PERIOD
1582030727090146,39:36,Elvis Malakoane,Michael wild very true Michael
1582030750584851,39:58,Erika Bown,@cassim suleman And so is DUDU!!!
1582030802747271,40:51,cassim suleman,so evil..u cant bring him in your house..might try to screw your wife or daughter..
1582030836921778,41:25,Elvis Malakoane,shameless corrupt and mercyless bunch of people
1582030837887576,41:26,Brian Mercado,He might leave with your cutlery
1582030844084730,41:33,cassim suleman,dudu ..yes..bigtime
1582030875183715,42:04,cassim suleman,rathermy cutlery..than a baby
1582030899572282,42:28,makhosi nobhatyi,Zuma was enriching himself over our struggles
1582030904115484,42:32,Luegi Msomi,"Mr X better have some protection because inKZN, people with this kind of evidence get murdered quickly."
1582030930833076,43:00,Granny Mokwena,exactly Chair
1582030954284804,43:22,Musa Mabunda,"@cassim suleman true, it happened, he slept Irvin Khoza's daughter and produced an offspring"
1582030956924276,43:25,Pheladi Lamola,Thalente insists Isibonelo did some work but doesn't have a record of what work was done. Go figure.
1582030957660013,43:26,mokopa,"@Luegi Msomi That's why the community must protect him, he is risking his life for SA"
1582030964994776,43:33,cassim suleman,@luegi..he is dead...family is dead..u dealing with mafia
1582030979256058,43:48,Clarah Ntombela,"shocking ,shocking am sick in my stomach"
1582030999917248,44:08,Clantonaqua,"MrX. u took your share too. R1.15 m in, but R1 m out. Another R1 m in but R800000 to JZF. Nice profit of R350 000😎"
1582031041455341,44:50,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,JZ is very clever. No trace of him receiving any money...a great chess move👏👏👏
1582031072394815,45:21,Musa Mabunda,@Clantonaqua he's some sort of Section 204 if you are au fait with the criminal procedure law
1582031131280018,46:19,Elvis Malakoane,Christopher Molefe he is not clever he is a crook but lies have short legs
1582031134570349,46:22,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Christopher Molefe there is, Dudu Myeni was chaired Zuma foundation"
1582031164618436,46:52,Wildthing,many dots joined today.
1582031171402180,46:59,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,"@Elvis Malakoane Yes, a clever crook"
1582031184854812,47:13,Musa Mabunda,"@CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE not that simple, circumstantial evidence is permissible and he can be nailed"
1582031191143496,47:19,Clantonaqua,@Musa . it was just an observation
1582031229374357,47:58,makhosi nobhatyi,Painful painful and sadness 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ please remove mr x
1582031235543768,48:03,Musa Mabunda,@Clantonaqua i was merely commenting on that observation
1582031249633782,48:17,cassim suleman,dudu was not supposed to be on water board as her period expired..but she still forced herself on board
1582031250112243,48:18,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,"@makhosi nobhatyi But her being the chair of the foundation is not evidence that he received cash. That we know from conventional wisdom, but no evidence"
1582031280777646,48:48,Clantonaqua,@Musa Mabunda . Sure
1582031281850324,48:49,Derek Main,@Elvis Malakoane Not only JZ a crook - he's a coward too.
1582031292141905,49:00,Jacqui Baumgardt,the name of the holder the number - at least that's what I need
1582031335109843,49:43,cassim suleman,his brains got rewired in robben island ..made him a devil
1582031344815282,49:53,Elvis Malakoane,Derek Main very true Derek
1582031347012621,49:55,Musa Mabunda,"@Jacqui Baumgardt name of holder you can put anything, sometimes what you can easily remember. You can say Jojo Tanks and put right account number, thats"
1582031377563307,50:26,Jacqui Baumgardt,my bank won't accept that @Musa Mabunda - they reject the transaction
1582031406466839,50:55,Jacqui Baumgardt,the name and the number must stack up
1582031448795720,51:36,Brian Mercado,Yes my bank also rejects
1582031514757225,52:42,cassim suleman,bank will hassle small guys..but allow big guys to go unquetioned

1582032043259172,1:01:31,Werner Bredenkamp,he cant even listen properly to what is asked from Zondo...he did not ask what cell number was used....They play in circles like every other person involved
1582032076112191,1:02:04,makhosi nobhatyi,Protection please DCJ give mr x
1582032117074796,1:02:45,Anne M.,@makhosi nobhatyi Witness protection is being provided
1582032137623566,1:03:07,Colleen Arezio,did write the conversation down and leave the transcript at office. his hiding.
1582032147893080,1:03:16,Werner Bredenkamp,why protection if he did not do what was right in the begin? should have spilled the beans.
1582032150584804,1:03:19,Wildthing,Judge
1582032158215971,1:03:26,Wildthing,is linking dots
1582032202389803,1:04:10,Erika Bown,"Mmmm.... Sounds a bit dodgy now. First he does remember (yesterday), then he doesn't, now he remember's some of the conversation."
1582032248437556,1:04:56,makhosi nobhatyi,For how long? This guy needed for life even his company@ Ann M
1582032253775255,1:05:02,Pheladi Lamola,I think it's nerves Erika. But man was gullible really

1582032296502847,1:05:44,CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,That JZF must be investigated
1582032298464200,1:05:46,Erika Bown,I sincerely hope it is that. We need him to be truthful so these people don't find any loopholes
1582032301455039,1:05:50,Anne M.,@makhosi nobhatyi I don't know. I don't think the death threats are going away any time soon.

1582032647016887,1:11:36,Vish Govender,Now that he has testified he should be safe because those implicated well be the first suspects and they would be wary not to aggravate their situation
1582032661616682,1:11:50,Pheladi Lamola,He's scared shame. Pleading with his community
1582032664222355,1:11:53,Musa Mabunda,"The problem is we don't arrest, prosecute and jail people in this country, now Mr X has spoken but he will continue to see people he testified against roaming around freely whilst he lives in fear"
