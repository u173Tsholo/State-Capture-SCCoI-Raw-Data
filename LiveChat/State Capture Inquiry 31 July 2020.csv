1596182208114744,-3:50,Dominic Przybylski,This commission is still looking for a leak after the boat has sunk.
1596182509532346,0:57,Dominic Przybylski,Cannot look for anything after drowning.
1596182574170112,2:03,Dominic Przybylski,People are now dying of starvation.
1596182768064126,5:17,Sal SA,Maj Gen Nonopi postponed - Covid?
1596182786426022,5:35,Dominic Przybylski,"Zondo has still not produced/publish anything to help, despite having taken 2 years and cost over R700 million."
1596182889902572,7:18,Sal SA,Dominic there was a legal issue preventing legal action until commission finalized. Legislation passed this week to clear this
1596182901589038,7:30,Karen x,Dominic Przybylski‚Äã FFS DO YOU NOT READ THE NEWS?????
1596182954746508,8:22,Sal SA,Easy Karen
1596183035291703,9:43,Sifiso Kheswa,Why administer the oath when everyone claims that everyone else is lying.
1596183041817046,9:50,Dominic Przybylski,Yes @Karen x I do read the news. Today I've been reading about how funds meant for saving us from the pandemic are being lost to runaway corruption. I'm reading how even more billions are going to SAA
1596183151855378,11:40,Ben Fraser,They should be saving for a second state of enquiry.
1596183186434036,12:15,Dominic Przybylski,Surely Zondo has seen enough to produce an interim report providing some guidance on what has caused this corruption and what may be of assistance to prevent even more of it.
1596183238202365,13:08,Sal SA,Dominic this was raised previously and DCJ said it was not possible
1596183377184924,15:25,Sal SA,People are still to give own versions and cross examine
1596183475255142,17:03,Dominic Przybylski,"That's our most urgent problem. Everyone now knows our country is riddled corruption but everyone says it is ""not possible"" to do anything about it."

1596184091023608,27:19,Leon Mbangwa,Oh this is bad for the Director of Foreign Intelligence. Sorry for those that have been protecting him blindly.
1596184095745914,27:21,Pastor J.J,@Village Man....The first report was considered a draft and needed to be amended with new fact before it became a final report
1596184109277808,27:38,Jacqui Baumgardt,Morning all

1596184158856542,28:27,Siphiwo from villages,"@Pastor J . He changed the report completely to protect his own friend, Anwar Dramat. No other reason"

1596184201900859,29:08,Sal SA,Who is July? missed the start due to transmission
1596184204328584,29:11,Pastor J.J,@Villager Man....Thats is not factual according to the evidence though
1596184220945896,29:25,Pastor J.J,@Sal...works at Werksmans
1596184249705242,29:57,Siphiwo from villages,"@Pastor J , go get the report. you will see this."
1596184257923509,30:06,funicanz,he may /might have changed the report. the question that I think he is emphasis the difference between the two.
1596184275612476,30:23,Sal SA,So he was employed by Nathi Nhleko to investigate IPId reports
1596184348078619,31:36,Elvis Malakoane,pastorj so enca is off today
1596184363319023,31:51,rohan barnard,@Elvis Malakoane they need data donations
1596184374503395,32:03,Lee D. Hendrix,@Jacqui Baumgardt there are too many kings and countries involved here.

1596184400860296,32:29,Jacqui Baumgardt,@Lee D. Hendrix - agree - more like cowboys and crooks though
1596184402274667,32:30,Leon Mbangwa,An investigation report cant even be changed by anyone who didn't carry out the investigations. Its only the prosecutor who will refuse to prosecute or ask for more information about the report.
1596184418241610,32:46,Elvis Malakoane,Rohan Barnard they must do it fast cos they are disturbing us
1596184459327216,33:28,Elvis Malakoane,Now we are squatting here

1596184607944050,35:56,MOSA MASENGANE,why do they sound like they missed the lecture on those reports
1596184617107921,36:05,Thapelo Motabogi,"class is in session,"

1596184935286923,41:22,Elvis Malakoane,I hope Nhleko is watching
1596184990550473,42:18,Pastor J.J,@Hadley....If they fall they will just bend and pick it up like they try with the Rand/Dollar
1596184999072213,42:26,Mars,sounds like someone is trying to start up a gas generator
1596184999235176,42:27,Madodana Tuntulwana,"Maybe lets wait and hear Mr July, the main Investigator of both reports, the media and the Implicated have confused us enough."

1596185213545384,46:02,Lee D. Hendrix,....Corrupt politicians are afforded esoteric advantages and the public is never aware of the decisions.
1596185232991560,46:20,Jacqui Baumgardt,@MOSA MASENGANE - it's about the reports submitted to Nhleko that he bumbled on about for three days
1596185247178266,46:33,Anne M.,@MOSA MASENGANE The report issued by Werksmans Attorneys around the rendition matter
1596185272876746,47:02,Elvis Malakoane,conprocZambia looks like interim in terms of IPID act has different implications on its operational phase
1596185279151114,47:06,rohan barnard,@MOSA MASENGANE and where Nhleko made examples of the whole day for 3 days without actually saying anything
1596185279627021,47:07,MOSA MASENGANE,ohh thanks guys
1596185303821397,47:31,Sean Collett,These people have to be payed to have this conversation? For real? They are literaly telling each other how to do there job...

1596185516220667,51:04,Sal SA,Its confusing that's why they mess up the job. Even the DCJ is battling to understand this hogwash
1596185519774033,51:07,Abel Matshidiso,they are just playing with words about why they ignored the report from the IPId
1596185549438758,51:37,Carl Botha,@Abel Matshidiso agree
