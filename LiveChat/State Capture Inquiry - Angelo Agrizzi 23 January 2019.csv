1548231646410396,13:53,thando cezula,NPA was rendered ineffective because of its politicization - I'm sure this is a provisional withdrawal

1548231763641050,15:50,Ngqapheli Mchunu,The state capture inquiry reveals that corruption is more about money than race. The urge to make corruption a 'black' trait has always been untoward.
1548231765113763,15:51,Blacks Whites,guys is me Nkosinathi
1548231774651365,16:01,thando cezula,This man can sing...
1548231775838935,16:03,Phahamang Thakudi,Konje why are Bosasa offices still not raided?
1548231817772254,16:44,Phahamang Thakudi,"Thando, this is platinum selling album 😂"
1548231825529576,16:52,Orapeleng Tawana,WHERE ARE THE EFF IDIOTS TODAY?
1548231830830416,16:58,Houws Houlinou,@Phahamang Thakudi They are waiting until the perpetrators are on a plane and then they will issue a warrant of arrest
1548231834979583,17:02,thando cezula,Phahamang they're busy shredding evidence by the bucket loads!
1548231842120330,17:08,Blacks Whites,is sing
1548231849008289,17:16,Dennis Martin Topkin,corruption is white man. thing divide and rule
1548231894306198,18:01,Phahamang Thakudi,"And the Hawks will only make a show of the raid later in the year, right?"
1548231974381976,19:21,Michael Michael,the anc??
1548231996539282,19:43,Franco Ferreira,How hypocrtical are the Watson brothers....aaaarrrgggghhhhh
1548232045921716,20:33,the village boi,may i please have R486 million to start my farming project
1548232211265246,23:18,Houws Houlinou,@Julian Martinez So the corrupt officials who took money are innocent victims of Freemasons?
1548232218583338,23:25,Phahamang Thakudi,I think people would more forgiving to a party that steals 10% and give 90% to the people and not this vice versa that the ANC is doing but hey ANC stays winning kunjalo 🤔
1548232239638047,23:46,Phahamang Thakudi,Not that they should be stealing to begin with
1548232251107798,23:58,the village boi,The Freemasons use corrupt law enforcement as an armoured car to secure the arrival and distribution of incoming shipments of illegal drugs/narcotics.
1548232254527492,24:01,Houws Houlinou,@Phahamang Thakudi What do you think will happen to you if you steal 10% of income from your employer?
1548232282919421,24:30,Phahamang Thakudi,As i said - Not that they should be stealing to begin with
1548232293519883,24:40,Michael Michael,company will shut
1548232313525761,25:00,Michael Michael,down
1548232342862841,25:30,Houws Houlinou,@Phahamang Thakudi Just illustrating how far our moral compass have shifted. We are grateful if they only steal a little.
1548232377809107,26:05,Houws Houlinou,@Phahamang Thakudi Only in South Africa. You get hijacked and then praise the Lord they didn't shoot your 2 year old on the back seat
1548232378816527,26:06,Goitsimang Mogorosi,"With all of this happening , can we not forget about the Gupta Family, Please"
1548232394048346,26:20,Michael Michael,no need to steal even one cent
1548232500026971,28:07,Houws Houlinou,@Julian Martinez We need accountability in this country - BY INDIVIDUALS. People have the freedom of choice. They choose to be criminal or not
1548232505276077,28:12,Phahamang Thakudi,@Houws Houlinou in an ideal country (world) it shouldnt be like that but here we are. What else can we do
1548232567846350,29:15,Kevin Davis,actually we should thank the watsons as this saga should put the ANC out of power surely the people can't vote for thia lot
1548232609430849,29:56,Houws Houlinou,@Phahamang Thakudi Not let the governing party get the majority vote. Let the opposition be the majority to serve the interest of the citizens
1548232636528175,30:23,Phahamang Thakudi,"@Kevin Davis you will be surprised, you shouldn't be but you will be unfortunate"
1548232709057363,31:35,Phahamang Thakudi,@Houws Houlinou ideally that's what I would like see as well - what do they call it? coalition?
1548232720129683,31:47,Kevin Davis,thakudi are u trying to say I am from.the UK that the south African citizens will vote for corruption
1548232760569916,32:27,Houws Houlinou,@Phahamang Thakudi No matter who wins the election. The opposition should have the power to hold the governing party to account if they don't serve South Africa's interests.
1548232783278467,32:50,Titi Pitso,Let's wait for the Commission to take its own course and not crucify ANC because of a few rotten potatoes.
1548232792172929,32:59,Kevin Davis,in the UK Theresa will be forced out on Brexit alone far less than the rot here
1548232801588060,33:08,Houws Houlinou,@Phahamang Thakudi The ANC had the majority vote. That is why they could just cover up corruption without fear. They just steamrolled everyone
1548232807286585,33:14,Michael Michael,jail term for those who are busy stealing our money must be increase.from 15 years to atleast 75 year.
1548232819373294,33:26,Phahamang Thakudi,"ANC is a rural party and unfortunately it plays on emotional blackmail on our fathers, uncles and aunts that they were liberated by them and no other"
1548232849743748,33:56,Titi Pitso,I agree with jail term for the thieves
1548232852969472,34:00,Vuxaka kiston Madebani,I think next a ACSA airport company South African.Bosasa was there for more than 20 years there on security industry
1548232895157237,34:42,Benny Bala,@Titi Pitso Unfortunately it's not the few.Zuma once said No-one is clean in the ANC.
1548232933001912,35:20,MIKE DURBAN,@Kevin.....My friend...sorry to say but......This Is Africa.....the ANC are seen as Saviors...no matter what...
1548232950600938,35:37,Tumelo ndlazi,jaw dropping evidence
1548232964246736,35:51,Houws Houlinou,@MIKE LOCK They saved themselves alright
1548233036238800,37:03,MIKE DURBAN,Shame......commie policy is ok with the ANC..
1548233039410090,37:06,Nizibone Madabane,I wonder what informs Agrizzi's decision to testify
1548233108898315,38:16,Prescott Smith's Fly Fishing Academy,The ANC from what I can see are no different than our situation here in The Bahamas. political index and not economic INDEPENDENCE for BAHAMIANS. The COLONIAL status quo is still in CONTROL
1548233229332154,40:16,Michael Michael,Agrizzi mentioning himself too.now is not eazy to c his motives.
1548233279248416,41:06,Daniel Prinsloo,the Bahamas are controlled by the Clintons
1548233310952266,41:36,Phahamang Thakudi,"Please search for ""The 1994 South African elections"" a perspective by Phyllis Jordan. You will understand why we are where we are with the ANC"
1548233369293016,42:36,Michael Michael,i have 5 kids.one dont like school the other four do attend school.must we paint them with same brush??
1548233387186902,42:54,Nqobile Ncube,"this is the world we leave in,its like this everywhere I would love to see how this will come to an end."
1548233457401535,44:04,Nqobile Ncube,you can only be liable to what happens to your life anything after it is outside your hands.
1548233457762159,44:05,Mxolisi Percival,Stealing has nothing to do with race but greediness
1548233472224920,44:19,Michael Michael,agree
1548233558044379,45:45,MIKE DURBAN,@Mxolisi......Spot on Bra...
1548233583662187,46:11,Michael Michael,are we gonna c steinhorf commision??pic billions stolen.interesting??
1548233628726694,46:55,Phahamang Thakudi,"""The 1994 South African elections"" a perspective by Phyllis Jordan. It's a letter written by A.C Jordan's wife, mother to Pallo Jordan"
1548233644797876,47:11,Mxolisi Percival,"This should widely open our eyes on who to vote for, as for me ANC has done enough for the country"
1548233650877683,47:17,MIKE DURBAN,@Michael....they too must be charged etc....
1548233779783059,49:26,Michael Michael,we will make sure we give them last chance
1548233810745002,49:57,Phahamang Thakudi,@Michael Michael lets hope the PIC inquiry will get to that too
1548233853664340,50:40,Tlou Chris,ANC will always loot money by the vehicle called tenders or Ratanang Trust or Zuma foundation that is how politicians steal money of tax pay!
1548233956086843,52:23,Benny Bala,@Tlou Chris So true and they are not willing to deliver us from poverty. The ANC is arrogant.
1548233969571189,52:36,Titi Pitso,"Let's give ANC another chance, it is just a few individuals not all of us"
1548234031983471,53:39,Blaze 613,"no it`s all of the anc, right down to branch level"
1548234037005932,53:44,Michael Michael,1.3 million chief of staff.that party with clean hands.mayor not aware of that.i want to be a premier.
1548234041823446,53:48,Phahamang Thakudi,@Titi Pitso 😂😂😂😏
1548234069141458,54:16,MIKE DURBAN,@Titi.......sorry friend.......the ANC suppoted Gupta's and Co......
1548234102081729,54:49,Benny Bala,@Titi Pitso These individuals should long have been prosecuted. It all happened under everybody's watch in the ANC.
1548234134930489,55:22,MIKE DURBAN,Therefore....ANC corrupt etc...
1548234142690267,55:29,Kirk gemmell,"When you add up Bossasa , CIP , Guptas , Soe’s - you’re probably only left with one Orr two individuals who are honest ? How can you continue to vote for this lot"
1548234156789513,55:43,Tlou Chris,"politicians will never care about the poor people, will always pretend as they care, the fact they will never care, they care about tenders and trust or foundation!"
1548234167697224,55:54,Benny Bala,It's painful.
1548234182490193,56:09,Nqobile Ncube,"every political party has people of influence behind,whoever you vote for at the end of the day has to move according to the masters toss,just like a board game."
1548234197900460,56:25,Collens Nkgadima,ANC is open for business. All corrupt capitalist investors must pay Luthuli House a visit
1548234203413682,56:30,Phahamang Thakudi,I can tell you now no party in SA is worth our votes but unfortunately we can't all stay home and not vote. Ideal election outcome is to not have any party with majority vote.
1548234203845949,56:30,Khalid Mather,"break the game , we dont need politicians"
1548234208549940,56:35,Phahamang Thakudi,They must all govern hand-to-hand maybe just maybe that way they will be able to guard each other
1548234273097137,57:40,Titi Pitso,I do understand your pain which is mine as well and but we need to give Cyril a chance.
1548234345728442,58:52,Benny Bala,Betrayal of the trust and loyalty. For more than 20 years. Too much.
1548234354517455,59:01,Blaze 613,"cyril has been part of this since day 1, spent his life in anc....chances he has been given"
1548234370384634,59:17,samuel molope,AGRIZZI IS LIAR
1548234391174903,59:38,Monethi alphonse,"Its too early to be judgmental at this stage, lets give cyril a chance. i totally agree"
1548234474063247,1:01:01,Benny Bala,@Blaze 613 Everything happened under Cyril's watch as a dep. President of the country. He had all the necessary powers to blow a whistle.
1548234478603585,1:01:05,MIKE DURBAN,Guys......just remember this......Cyril and co....are all cut from the same ANC cloth.......don't trust them too much i'm afraid...
1548234498675411,1:01:26,Khalid Mather,give cyril a chance 😂😂😂 shem
1548234520816582,1:01:48,Zola Marali,"I'm worried about these combo of Ramaphosa, Jeff Radebe and Motsipe something will come out one day."
1548234522888912,1:01:50,Tlou Chris,tenders belong to Politicians or they friends not poor people!
1548234575925191,1:02:43,Phahamang Thakudi,"Blood brothers, my sisters are your wives so"
1548234586470259,1:02:53,Benny Bala,How many chances does a leader need to deliver? Cyril was busy enriching himself. He did not care. Why must he care now?
1548234610384416,1:03:17,Phahamang Thakudi,Agrizzi is sleeping 😂😂
1548234639424495,1:03:46,Michael Michael,small gruop of rulling party are thief now we must get rid of them
1548234651419863,1:03:58,Samkelo Ngema,Thought i was the only one who saw him sleeping
1548234687181101,1:04:34,Titi Pitso,"Yes but we must understand how Cyril works, he is not confrontational person and that does not mean he approved of all what was happening otherwise he would not have threatened to resigned when"
1548234692120582,1:04:39,Phahamang Thakudi,@Samkelo Ngema he was 😂 did you see him waking up?
1548234702047341,1:04:49,samuel molope,"DONT TRUST THIS GUY AGRIZZI HE WILL SPOIL THE WHOLE COMMISSION,HES A LIAR CANT BE TRUSTED"

1548234796510458,1:06:23,Phahamang Thakudi,😂
1548234827698706,1:06:54,Khalid Mather,"why do people fight against justice, black or white? we cant ignore 1 offense because another offense is not dealt with, we gotta fix it all"
1548234896198631,1:08:03,Nqobile Ncube,@Khalid Mather do you think this commission is about justice??
1548234960300589,1:09:07,SIMPHIWE S'BONISO MADONSELA,Imagine what will be revealed when the corruption that has allegedly occurred at Eskom is finally exposed
1548235016326677,1:10:03,Benny Bala,"@Nqobile Ncube It can lay the basis of one being investigated and prosecuted by law. If actions are unconstitutional, they are illegal."
1548235024858951,1:10:12,Khalid Mather,unearthing the filth of corruption should be a component of justice @Nqobile Ncube
1548235038461607,1:10:25,Neville Loubser,no jiba coverage??
1548235064293575,1:10:51,Lesego Modise,"Guys is the list I saw yesterday for real, the one listing politicians n government officials on state capture?"
