1555493474341495,1:25:28,S Nompozolo,@rohan barnard she left yes. Infact left Gauteng.
1555493479898721,1:25:34,rohan barnard,@Musa Bakiti don't even get me started on churches. Those are the biggest bigots ever. Abusing religion to fill their own pockets and not even pay tax on that huge income.

1555493590223930,1:27:25,rohan barnard,@Magda Seguin churches are just one big orgy. Look at all the sexual abuse claims against the ministers and popes
1555493600186203,1:27:34,Magda Seguin,All done under the banner of freedom of religion
1555493633358172,1:28:07,rohan barnard,And none of those cases gets anywhere.
