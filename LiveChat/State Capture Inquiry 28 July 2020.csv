1595924075798616,10:29,Andr√© du Plessis,So when he presented the firepool expination there was a song playing
1595924138322151,11:33,Andr√© du Plessis,reminder this is the guy who brought up the Berlin Conference yesterday... anyway the firepool song continues thus...
1595924154859456,11:47,Andr√© du Plessis,"Ma il mio mistero √® chiuso in meIl nome mio nessun sapr√†No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dir√≤Quando la luce splender√†Ed il mio bacio scioglier√†Il silenzio che ti fa mia"
1595924246303041,13:19,Andr√© du Plessis,"No Sleep, No sleep, No one will know my name - no, no, I'll say it on your mouth"
1595924290924677,14:03,Andr√© du Plessis,"the previous comment is the translation of the firepool song, funny he did indeed battle to sleep"
1595924312459176,14:25,Dominic Przybylski,ANC now has got themselves a R70 billion loan from IMF so it's now party time!
1595924348973940,15:02,Andr√© du Plessis,"I think the IMF loan should form part of the state capture hearing now already, just to get a head start"

1595924436933562,16:30,Andr√© du Plessis,"then very wild arm descriptions, as if this fixes languagge and grammer and so on"
1595924499494421,17:33,Dominic Przybylski,CR's spokesperson is married to one of our 14 kings and queens who take R500 million per year from our taxes. He is the sole director of the company which got a R120 million tender to supply PPEs.

1595924854939754,23:28,Andr√© du Plessis,Mike I think it's worse than that... if breath is moving through the vocal chords it turns to lies... this guy can hum a lie
1595924970624509,25:21,Dominic Przybylski,There's a difference between government and governance. I'm losing faith in Zondo. This is taking too long. He already has enough information to establish what the basic problem is.
1595925039368901,26:31,Wilson M,I just came in. what agents is he talking about?

1595925648021453,36:41,Dominic Przybylski,CR is BEE billionaire courtesy of ANC. It's payback time. Expect to be disappointed if you are not corrupt.
1595925667812330,37:01,Jake L,Aye JOBURG
1595925711517987,37:43,Andr√© du Plessis,the navelfluff in my navel is relative to my stomach and the institutions that report to the greater portfolio that rubs against the shirt which nakes up the fluff in my bellybutton

1595926166516632,45:19,Abel Matshidiso,he's not a suspect but rather an implicated person in wrong doing
1595926194100981,45:46,Dominic Przybylski,@chimbuzi1 The government will have to print money to repay the loan and then we will be heading into Zimbabwe style hyper-inflation.
1595926201431410,45:52,Monare Mohwaduba,I hope so Maphumula

1595926282398977,47:14,chimbuzi1,"@Dominic Przybylski yes thats obvious, with a shrinking tax base, printing is the only option, thus diluting the wealth of all citizens who have any money on hand."

1595926376653964,48:49,Adrien McGuire,I think this witness's Nkandla fire pool nonsense is going to come back and haunt him . What rubbish is he complaining about the state changes reports !
1595926378356142,48:51,Andr√© du Plessis,Money printer go Brrrrr in Yuan

1595926575111699,52:07,chimbuzi1,"@Wilson M be careful he will drive to your house for a fight , for that comment"
1595926718812316,54:31,Bev Daniels,"Kumaran, yes you are right, but we need to have a new government. As my husband put it, we were actually better off during apartheid rule, just a pity they put certain regulations in place."
1595926718945486,54:31,Andr√© du Plessis,wow judge rubbing them witness privates to make sure he is happy in the witness box

1595927126516631,1:01:19,Mandla Mngomezulu,"Zondo is very smart. To enable Nhleko to answer the question he jas beennavoiding, is pretending there is problem with the microphone and ask him to repeat himself."

1595932679443706,2:33:51,Tebogo Mohohlo,"guys, the aim of the commission is to find out WHAT HAPPENED, HOW AND WHY IT HAPPENED (WHAT IN OUR LAWS MADE IT POSSIBLE) and how can it BE AVOIDED IN FUTURE SO THAT IT NEVER REOCCURS"
1595932681021153,2:33:52,dennis oldude,The questioning is in respect of your actions - not the reports that you didn't produce
1595932690442769,2:34:03,Tshepo Mokhutle,diverting
1595932690873550,2:34:04,BEE-llionaire Okwacha,The evidence leader is asking on behalf of the chair? Just answer the question.
1595932731327075,2:34:43,Lebohang Mofokeng,The evidence leader knows what he is doing..... Nathi Nhleko wants his way
1595932752160754,2:35:05,StarManRSA,Zondo sees through all this. Bravo.

1595932796407640,2:35:50,Anax B,this guy wants to justify his actions by what is contained in the report. but he should explain why prompted him to think there was something untoward about having two reports??
1595932831853482,2:36:25,dennis oldude,Why say yes or no when you can answer with a thousand words to say nothing and avoid the answer
1595932856976012,2:36:48,StarManRSA,Jokes to lengthen the question. Great strategy.
1595932867164354,2:36:59,BEE-llionaire Okwacha,just answer the question.

1595932890485567,2:37:23,Dominic Przybylski,"Do something himself! He doesn't do things himself. Private sector ""does"" things, not public sector!"
1595932892491386,2:37:25,dennis oldude,Shades of responses in the format laid down bu Zuma
1595932895735201,2:37:28,Jacqui Baumgardt,"people who talk to much are ducking, diving and dodging"

1595933093859299,2:40:46,Tebogo Mohohlo,"melusi, eskom and SAA has an incompetence issue. Leaders do not take political instructions in administering a service unless the instructions are in line with the election mandate"

1595933200410212,2:42:32,Gabisile Mahlangu,Chair is not playing today!
1595933221144436,2:42:54,Dominic Przybylski,Cadre deployment and misuse of BEE is primary cause of corruption. Any solution has to tackle both issues.
1595933263729203,2:43:35,Francoise Phillips,"Can SARS and the Hawks not just investigate this crook's personal finances and o a lifestyle audit, then arrest him, lock him up and throw away the key, sparing us all this obsfucation."
1595933271595131,2:43:44,Melusi Sikakane,"@Dominic Przybylski Our problem is that we dont have opposition parties, otherwise vote anc out"

1595933314434547,2:44:27,Tebogo Mohohlo,"we need not vote the ANC out, we just need them not to achieve 50% majority."
1595933381764355,2:45:35,Francoise Phillips,"A vote for the ANC is a vote for poverty for the people, filthy hospitals, broken schools and drinking water full of sewerage if you are so lucky to have access to water."
1595933419688164,2:46:11,Melusi Sikakane,@Tebogo Mohohlo ANC is pleasing its funders. If you owe me you are my servant.
1595933422327867,2:46:15,Conproc zambia limited,this lawyer for the minister sounds clever.
1595933480710162,2:47:14,Dominic Przybylski,@Melusi Sikakane We are in a very new and immature democracy. It is nothing more than a facade for power guaranteed by racial polarization. I think our democracy is a farce.
