1557404124616998,13:01,Petrus Mthimkhulu,this commission is mathematically challenged it appears ü§£
1557404144403794,13:21,Felix Muyoba,@Petrus Mthimkhulu true
1557404215923761,14:33,watson mutanga,2 decimal places means your figure has two numbers after the decimal sign. The last number is affected by whether the third number is below or above the number 5.
1557404250935507,15:07,Felix Muyoba,@watson mutanga true and i dont whay they are struggling about
1557404304319809,16:01,Felix Muyoba,the witness is also confusing the chair
1557404517845777,19:35,Felix Muyoba,2 decimal places..that is simple then..69.98 will automatically be 70
1557404743220705,23:20,Thelsa,When working with Mr Peter Volmink I found him to be a man of high morale principles
1557404776586527,23:53,Lorna Kavanagh,Felix it rounds off to 70 only if the 69.98? and third decimal place is over 5 then it becomes 70.
1557404813455599,24:30,Felix Muyoba,@Lorna Kavanagh yeah but in that case there was no third digit
1557404991689790,27:29,Lorna Kavanagh,... then it stays as .69.8 and cannot change to .70
1557405069551176,28:46,Felix Muyoba,no but then nobody can qualify..use your discretion that it should rather rounded to whole number..
1557405077515614,28:54,Lorna Kavanagh,the gentleman says it has to be 3 decimal points to change
1557405144754004,30:01,Felix Muyoba,@Lorna Kavanagh the one who used that criteria was wrong..he/she was suppoed to mean rounding to the whole number and not decimal digits
1557405151771643,30:09,watson mutanga,69.98 is already in two decimal place format. It becomes 70 after its converted to a whole number.
1557405248001228,31:45,Lorna Kavanagh,.... but they require it to be 3 decimal points
1557405283114406,32:20,Felix Muyoba,@Lorna Kavanagh that was wrong or it is an exclusion tactic
1557405397736842,34:14,Felix Muyoba,the authors of those regulations are incompetent
1557405468397129,35:26,Beatrice Wambui,eff all the way
1557405487247489,35:45,Lorna Kavanagh,it is their regulations (government) that it be done thus... it makes a big difference when talking about billions of ramd.
1557405585800021,37:22,Felix Muyoba,the problem will be that those regulations can be challenged in a court of law and that will cost government more billions instead
1557405754023223,40:11,Dante Beukes,does anyone want to play a game of minecraft
1557405783033212,40:40,Mvalson,WE DEMAND FOR A RE-RUN
1557405796206976,40:53,Lorna Kavanagh,if the contract/tender states 3 decimall points then courts will stand by that.
1557405868546382,42:06,Terencd Caldwell,@Felix Muyoba --- don't u mean cost tax payers more money?
1557405879514136,42:16,Felix Muyoba,@Lorna Kavanagh but you are missing the point..the issue here is the whole number which should be the score and not decimal numbers..
1557406009381445,44:26,Ali daacad laky alii,hi
1557406018472018,44:35,Lorna Kavanagh,Felix i am going by what this gentleman said to the commission.
1557406034751746,44:51,Felix Muyoba,"if you keep on hunting for the 3rd, 4th or 5th digits then 69 will never be 70 which was the threshold of qualification..now why wasting time like that instead using the whole number the threshold?"
1557406178374294,47:15,Felix Muyoba,now i see..so brian was there when these confusing criteria were in place?
1557406295633848,49:12,Felix Muyoba,"@Terencd Caldwell i mean that if regulation for tendering are not crafted properly, government will pay a lot of money through litigations"
1557406393186141,50:50,Ashney Chetty,Mr Volmink is one of a few people within Public Sector Procurement that understands the complexity of the numerous ambiguous pieces of legislation
1557406428394100,51:25,Felix Muyoba,@Ashney Chetty i agree with you
1557406459705169,51:56,Ashney Chetty,Mr Volmink is providing an invaluable service to this Commission
1557406477311899,52:14,watson mutanga,"@Felix Muyoba - the point is that the government doesn‚Äôt own the revenues it collects. It‚Äôs from taxpayers, etc."
1557406521568909,52:58,Felix Muyoba,@watson mutanga i understand
1557406941371709,59:58,Sofia Sofia,Has the ANC won the elections ?
1557407039625669,1:01:36,Felix Muyoba,it is the arrogance of mr molefe (brian) that motivated him to take that decision instead of using the legal opinion of the group..
1557407080060678,1:02:17,Mokhosi Mohapi,"the people have spoken, ANC rules, where ----> Nationally"

1557407977030240,1:17:14,Lloyd Langenhoven,Kheshani what socks do you smoke?
1557408034030995,1:18:11,Lloyd Langenhoven,Whites control president selection? Do you not see the black president we currently have?
1557408057105658,1:18:34,Born free,Stop blaming whites for everything. Research Africa's history it was the Africans that captured Africans and sold them to slaves traders
1557408058901195,1:18:36,Salt-Mine Boss,"Indd Lloyd, how about the reverse of what ""Rose""said."
1557408260619271,1:21:58,Khensani Rose,You don‚Äôt know politics shut up. If blacks are truly in control and able to have free reign of their countries there wouldn‚Äôt be 8% of the population that owns 94% of the land. Please shut UP!
1557408269773004,1:22:07,Born free,Research The Arab slave trade. Arabs and the African slave trade lasted 13 centuries long before the Europeans arrived and lasted from the 7th century to 1960s.

1557408331043400,1:23:08,Lloyd Langenhoven,"Oh come on, Rose. Now you're shifting the goal posts - how does voting link up with land ownership? You sound like an EFF supporter because all you try do is speak about land and act racist."
1557408335142246,1:23:12,Khensani Rose,Read a history book. Preferable one that is NOT written by a racist!
1557408367042423,1:23:44,Lloyd Langenhoven,Why is there a black president if whites control it all? How does that work?
1557408441260012,1:24:58,Sthakathi Khumalo,Can`t we just have Molefe come answer to this??
1557408444731774,1:25:02,Khensani Rose,The only people that have truly advanced in AZANIA under ‚Äúblack presidents‚Äù have been whitest.
1557408453181250,1:25:10,Lloyd Langenhoven,"It's ironic that you accuse others of racism yet you display blatant racism yourself, Rose."
1557408464619236,1:25:21,Sthakathi Khumalo,Khensani Rose You remind me of Moises Machel!!
1557408466588589,1:25:23,Lloyd Langenhoven,"A ""white black"" now? hahahaha"
1557408504630275,1:26:02,Lloyd Langenhoven,"Rose is a closet racist, probably because of the EFF emboldening rubbish statements like hers."
1557408527197806,1:26:25,Lloyd Langenhoven,Blacks under the feet of whites?! CYRIL IS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE.
1557408549719689,1:26:46,Lloyd Langenhoven,"Let me guess, Johan Rupert is actually Cyril?"
1557408570479069,1:27:07,John-Basel Ioannou,afternoon all.who is this guy and designation?

1557408619387817,1:27:56,Felix Muyoba,@Lloyd Langenhoven you guys are happy when anc wins because you know that what they were evangelising about land expropriation was just a rhetoric..it will be business as usual..

1557408647875042,1:28:24,John-Basel Ioannou,thanks
1557408665961891,1:28:43,Khensani Rose,Any white person living in South Africa and comfortable with 92% of the original habitants current conditions are the racist. Closet and openly.
1557408683020583,1:28:59,Lloyd Langenhoven,92% of what?
1557408719584248,1:29:37,Lloyd Langenhoven,"Also, Rose - how does 92% matter to your comment about whites controlling the election of the President?"
1557408775031871,1:30:32,Salt-Mine Boss,Rose are you Khoi or San. Or do you know how to grow food that can keep the ground you have beneficial TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY? If not..Don't claim.
1557408796550957,1:30:53,Sthakathi Khumalo,Powder Milk hair is saying Molefe awarded contracts unlawfully..
1557408847455519,1:31:44,Ben Cole,Can Khensani Rose tell us what the source of her 92% claim is?
1557408906516295,1:32:43,Lloyd Langenhoven,ANC itself doesn't even have land audit stats but Rose magically has them
1557408937224719,1:33:14,Lloyd Langenhoven,Anyways - I'm waiting for Rose to tell us how whites control the voting and appointment of the President.
1557408981428234,1:33:58,Lloyd Langenhoven,She turned to the wrong page in her EFF book - that's why she shouted out 92%.
