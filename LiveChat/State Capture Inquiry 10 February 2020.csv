1581325926583891,1:00:34,Paul Buchel,"Keep on smiling Memela, DCJ will not take it."
1581325974380052,1:01:21,Phillip Cwazibe,What is attorney Mbanjwa saying.
1581325979316241,1:01:27,David Tuer,Memela is explaining the roundabout used by all these execs to disguise the reality of the transaction (theft).
1581325983332937,1:01:30,Person of interest,punching above your weight Ms lawyer...
1581326023568481,1:02:10,Nielan Nagan,she is starting to sound like Sara lady at nugent enquiry
1581326047653603,1:02:34,Derek Main,Seems like this lawyer is just there to frustrate the process.

1581326108748132,1:03:36,Eliot Chauke,@Derek Main i agree. Hofmeyer is frustrating the process
1581326115807588,1:03:42,Masedi Matlala,Ms Memela though.....

1581326240643053,1:05:47,Bev Daniels,they are stalling because Ms Hofmeyer only finished 17 of her 31 issues on Fri and this lady says she needs to get to East London today and stated that it must not go over 3 hours ......
1581326249540401,1:05:56,anya van loggerenberg,@Stronger together lol thats an insult to sumo wrestlers
1581326251260790,1:05:58,Nkululeko Mdluli,Eish things r heating up here no dull moment at all😰😰
1581326263371551,1:06:10,Phillip Cwazibe,Judge Zondo educating an advocate.
1581326278179800,1:06:25,Pheladi Lamola,Is she not pressed for time anymore? I remember on Friday she said she could only avail herself for a specific period?
1581326306319064,1:06:53,Person of interest,Ms Memela you are making things worse for yourself if you continue to treat Ms Hofmeyr as public enemy No 1
1581326345723011,1:07:32,Anne M.,@Pheladi Lamola I thought the same thing
1581326362145674,1:07:49,mandisi ntauzana,"Adv Memela is dealing with the questions nicely, am just worried that the chair is allowing Adv Hoffmeyr to much space and giving her a lot of benefit of a doubt."
1581326365627822,1:07:52,Bev Daniels,@Pheladi Lamola see my note Bev Daniels
1581326365760066,1:07:52,Eliot Chauke,Memela wana assist...

1581326404634329,1:08:32,Eliot Chauke,Hofmeyet is selective and only focus on the Narrative
1581326406623722,1:08:34,Derek Main,@mandisi ntauzana Yes - Ms Memela is a consummate liar.
1581326429619443,1:08:56,Pheladi Lamola,I just saw it Bev. Thank you

1581326543306013,1:10:49,Bev Daniels,"@Kevin, what is your surname"
1581326568925538,1:11:16,Bev Daniels,"AS my son is called Kevin as well, so have to be cautious then to put things on this site."
1581326569116840,1:11:17,Anne M.,@Eliot Chauke Ms Mamela isn't as innocent as you think. Listen to Friday's evidence later if you can.
1581326581282517,1:11:28,mandisi ntauzana,Awume @Derek Main what feature is Adv Memela's look is similar or looks like a crook?
1581326599458419,1:11:46,Tich Ziny,Even I would be annoyed at the stupid interjection
1581326623835643,1:12:11,Person of interest,Kevin's surname is Hofmeyr
1581326630148407,1:12:17,Kevin,If i am your son Bev then you would be 85 years old plus some 😂
1581326637563606,1:12:25,Pastor J.J,@Elvis Malakoane ...Sorry friend but for some reason I do not see the chats from stronger together. What happened bro?
1581326669256105,1:12:56,Derek Main,@mandisi ntauzana It's the ducking and diving and unwillingness to just answer questions and the continuous smiling at the chair as if it is all a joke to her.
1581326670244138,1:12:57,Jacqui Baumgardt,@Pastor J - his dad passed away

1581327021540159,1:18:49,Pastor J.J,"It came about the same day the ""warrant of Arrest"" was issued @Elvis Malakoane"
1581327062725844,1:19:30,Bev Daniels,"@Elvis, yes it did come at the right time, and Ms Memela is one of them that falls into that clause"
