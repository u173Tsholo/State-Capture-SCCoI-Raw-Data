1542635390876390,55:53,Siba Mfabe,"@Sthakathi Khumalo , if you met them and did nothing for them, what does that mean? Is it remotely impossible that people took meetings to understand their true intentions."

1542635873658523,1:03:55,Job Mokolutlo,It`s quite worrisome that the EEF has made a U-turn to wage war against PG but sees it fit to defend Moyane and cabal
1542635878492737,1:04:01,Danie Nilsen,what worries me the most is that since mbeki this was going on an so far only shabir sheik went to jail a bit why do you think it is so
1542635887428591,1:04:09,peter pott,"@mfabe, he doesn't even choose to have black advocates for his own matters."
