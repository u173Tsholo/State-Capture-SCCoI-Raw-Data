1596202010428636,1:24:54,Akhonamandla Gala,Mr July is a smart guy
1596202013939746,1:24:57,Sthakathi Khumalo,"July is clear though, problem is we want to listen to the commission with already one sided views.."

1596202178341471,1:27:41,Bradley Petersen,Who's Mr July ?
1596202183845353,1:27:47,Pieter Engelbrecht,question...how is any of this improving the lives of ordinary SA citizens? lots of talk...legal terms (which the majority of people do not understand).
1596202214537704,1:28:17,Herb Tuck,Miss June’s brother
1596202216338236,1:28:19,Pieter Engelbrecht,so they get the facts/evidence. what then?
1596202231816993,1:28:34,Nkululeko Njapha,Mr July is clear it just that many have already made up their mind about who is guilty and who is innocents. If you touch the perceived angels irrespective of the facts you are labelled as a GUPTA.
1596202234670968,1:28:37,Bradley Petersen,"fokal, just fokal happens @Pieter Engelbrecht"

1596202300028917,1:29:42,Mangalani Mangalani,@Pieter Engelbrecht This is critical for SA. We need rule of Law as foundation for this country. We need politicians/civil servants to understand they’ll be held accountable for their action.

1596202310075260,1:29:53,Nkululeko Njapha,@Saneman If he wants to recline the chair so what?

1596202846789020,1:38:49,Madodana Tuntulwana,Indeed the Commission is helping SA to know the factual side of things. We are now privy to information that has been distorted for years.

1596204486565168,2:06:10,Gugulethu Xhosans,hehe the knot has been untied. The report was to be used to legitimate the suspension of Anwat Dramat so that Ntlemeza can take over.
1596204509924173,2:06:33,Sal SA,I'm blocking XhoiXhoi - to do so highlight the name and select ' Block'
1596204532001687,2:06:56,Pieter Engelbrecht,Yup that's an option
1596204539800059,2:07:03,Naledi Barron,@XhoiXhoi GrandSon. Now you are being facetious! C'mon! I'm being serious.
1596204546816959,2:07:10,Pieter Engelbrecht,But i like to hear both sides...far left and far right

1596204695672425,2:09:38,Sthakathi Khumalo,But July has been clear in his articulation.
1596204726373868,2:10:10,Thembelani Ndlazi,"I just wonder why on EARTH did McBride go to state capture. He had won, apparently on a technicality of law about IPID independence. Yhuuu kanti he covered up murderers. He should have just walked."
1596204735854680,2:10:20,Sal SA,I agree Naledi
1596204766705498,2:10:48,Sthakathi Khumalo,People come to state capture to settle political scores like some have said and its true

1596204798892869,2:11:22,Naledi Barron,Thank you Sal SA and Pastor J. Let's keep it civil and on point.

1596204898941253,2:13:01,Pieter Engelbrecht,let's hear what the commission has to say
1596204901386408,2:13:05,Anne M.,"@Pastor J Looks like g o a t ' s brother is on the chat. Need to make a bigger fire, or a second fire."
1596204915413207,2:13:18,Gugulethu Xhosans,"The way Mr July is fighting to save his life in that commission, you would swear he only had one day before being thrown into jail"
1596204921274400,2:13:25,Naledi Barron,@Jonathan Ganesh . No JG. I'm not. Can we get past the trolling nonsense and enjoy each other's decent comments please?
1596204929425199,2:13:32,Pastor J.J,@Anne...Enough for both. Can include a sister as well
1596204945983607,2:13:48,Moses Timana,thank you @Pastor J

1596204986208852,2:14:29,mandla nkosi,It seems like Judge Zondo has what he wanted from this witness
1596205016127301,2:14:59,Pieter Engelbrecht,@mandla nkosi yup
1596205042014316,2:15:25,Pieter Engelbrecht,July has a very interesting posture.
1596205096562768,2:16:20,Sal SA,You mean cute🤣
1596205108323077,2:16:31,Pieter Engelbrecht,lol
1596205192275721,2:17:56,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,July is not a push over.
1596205248546620,2:18:51,Pieter Engelbrecht,like with any other country
1596205254639942,2:18:58,NathiTheGamer99,lol
1596205260578319,2:19:05,Lee D. Hendrix,"...No official gives respect to the Constitution/people, but to a particular person's wishes. Who is this mysterious artificer?"
1596205261749838,2:19:07,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,Zimbabwe and South African police do have meetings together
1596205293666108,2:19:39,Naledi Barron,@Jonathan Ganesh. Indeed! Definitely a breach in terms of a foreign force unless sanctioned at official level by SAPS.
1596205294932663,2:19:40,Sal SA,Did this rendition ever take place or was it a figment of someone's imagination?
1596205315366748,2:19:58,Pieter Engelbrecht,so...how dafuq do you get that right
1596205319083191,2:20:01,Pieter Engelbrecht,where is the law now
1596205334633513,2:20:19,Pieter Engelbrecht,gonna give someone a call and go there
1596205340356335,2:20:25,Colleen Arezio,his making alot of assumptions and as law goes that's wrong.
1596205342474280,2:20:27,Moses Timana,"this is shocking to me, so SAPS and Zimbabwean police working together in the country? very disturbing"
1596205354303655,2:20:39,mandla nkosi,The rendition took place and people died
1596205411285650,2:21:33,Sal SA,Where was it proven Mandla?
1596205417217801,2:21:41,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,Policing in a foreign country must be unlawfull
1596205427579315,2:21:50,Gerda 7,Anything is possible in SA Remember the Guptas landing at Waterkloof wth no documentation??
1596205429676498,2:21:52,Naledi Barron,ANY collaboration/cooperation by sovereign law enforcement agencies should have been sanctioned by Interpol or its legal equicalent.
1596205460699443,2:22:23,Naledi Barron,Oops! Pardon spelling!
1596205464805181,2:22:27,Pieter Engelbrecht,@Luvuyo Zantsi there are certain organizations that can operate in any country.
1596205478810458,2:22:42,Lee D. Hendrix,...Gerda 7 ...TREASON is correct......
1596205519100403,2:23:24,Pieter Engelbrecht,#facepalm
1596205530355449,2:23:33,Bill West,Are they discussing immigration charges or state capture? At this rate the issue of prosecuting the thieves will never conclude
1596205534223360,2:23:38,Akhonamandla Gala,time up!!
1596205544107831,2:23:47,Pieter Engelbrecht,@Jonathan Ganesh you had enough hibiscus tea
1596205545631256,2:23:49,Carl Botha,Number one had a call and Guptas landed at W#aterkloof?
1596205547862671,2:23:51,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,@Pieter Engelbrecht There is a difference between structures like Interpol and foreign country police.
1596205558363551,2:24:00,Madodana Tuntulwana,"Violation of international laws, national laws, immigration laws, torturing and killing of suspects and witnesses and no one has accounted for that."
1596205565877745,2:24:09,Pieter Engelbrecht,@Luvuyo Zantsi agreed. but we will never know.
1596205569507495,2:24:12,Naledi Barron,@Jonathan Ganesh . Behave please.
1596205569788478,2:24:13,mandla nkosi,Yep that is why there was an investigation. The Police Portfolio Committee was asking questions to Nathi Mthethwa who was the Minister then
1596205597996939,2:24:40,Pieter Engelbrecht,@Jonathan Ganesh that was my point earlier
1596205616144466,2:25:00,Sal SA,We excuse you Ganesh
1596205621381214,2:25:06,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,@mandla nkosi Nathi Nhleko not Mthethwa.
1596205624803742,2:25:09,Mohamed Mia,Yes Jonathan agree with you . Waste of time and money
1596205626614862,2:25:11,THABO Mosiane,only State Security can give permission for another foreign security to work in our country through the permission of the president and the minister of police
1596205641965971,2:25:25,Bill West,Jonathan you don't need a crystal ball to conclude that
1596205676332739,2:25:59,Pieter Engelbrecht,@thabo segonyonyo so how did USA order the execution of certain people in the middle east?
1596205693427915,2:26:16,Pieter Engelbrecht,wait...they used drones...nevermind
1596205703867482,2:26:26,mandla nkosi,No Sir Nathi Mthethwa. Rendition took place during Mthethwa's era
1596205711455244,2:26:34,Naledi Barron,"@Jonathan Ganesh . Put the brakes on please, and either concentrate and comment on the broadcast, or zip it!"
1596205728353394,2:26:51,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,General Sibiya recently won a labour court case for being fired because of this rendition case.
1596205763838079,2:27:26,Josh Leonard,Mr Hulley is trying to hard.
1596205793359529,2:27:56,Bill West,What has this trial have to doe with proving the guilt of the miscreants?
1596205798980455,2:28:01,Sal SA,USA also did extradition in SA many years ago by the CIA. I think it was in Ladysmith
1596205800909033,2:28:03,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,@mandla nkosi Nathi Nhleko was in this commission last week and he was asked about this
1596205905419511,2:29:48,Madodana Tuntulwana,"It is so informative to watch and listening to this testmony. It gives us the honest truth, not the truth from the pepertrators assisted by media."
1596205912388250,2:29:55,Naledi Barron,"@Jonathan Ganesh . Perhaps it is. Nevertheless, at least it is a public enquiry."
1596205912585740,2:29:56,Conproc zambia limited,just his hair do makes you know he has alot on his head
1596205939940807,2:30:23,Pieter Engelbrecht,@Madodana Tuntulwana but how do you know this is the truth?
1596205961088569,2:30:45,mandla nkosi,Yes he was there because he commissioned an investigation by Welshman and he suspended Dramat and Mcbride but the rendition took place before him as Minister of Police sir
1596205964623133,2:30:48,THABO Mosiane,@Sal SA. they got permission from the state security and they were accompanied by the minster of foreign affairs and the general of defence force
1596206008695341,2:31:33,Sal SA,Says who Thanbo
1596206020046725,2:31:43,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,"@mandla nkosi Ok, I get you."
1596206030533721,2:31:54,Sal SA,sorry Thabo
1596206101514010,2:33:04,mandla nkosi,@Luvuyo 👍👍
1596206115915886,2:33:18,Sal SA,Thabo if rendition is illegal how can they get state approval. Not allowed
1596206137678336,2:33:41,Naledi Barron,"@Jonathan Ganesh . Perhaps. But I reiterate, there ARE those who listen, and hopefully learn."
1596206183708123,2:34:27,Pieter Engelbrecht,(especially in the US) the practice of sending a foreign criminal or terrorist suspect covertly to be interrogated in a country with less rigorous regulations for the humane treatment of prisoners.
1596206199176713,2:34:42,Anne M.,"@Luvuyo Zantsi Nathi Mthethwa was Minister of Police when the rendition occurred. Nathi Nhleko appointed Werksmans and suspended Dramat, McBride etc when he became Minister in 2014"
1596206205645046,2:34:48,Leon Mbangwa,The head of Foreign Intelligence Services takes office sorounded by gross allegations of cross border crime. South Africa is not getting better
1596206231792293,2:35:15,THABO Mosiane,@Sals SA. you can go back to that case and check. it was published remember after it happened. hence anything that happens out your borders gets published 14 after the mission.
1596206264681709,2:35:48,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,A lesson to be learnt is that we should not conclude on guilt after listening to only one witness without hearing the other side of the story.
1596206309643686,2:36:32,Naledi Barron,@Luvuyo Zantsi . Absolutely agree.
1596206330151760,2:36:53,Pastor J.J,"Rendition/Extradition and a Sanctioned Arrest are 3 distinctly difference processes. The first is illegal and the f,\.f 2 are the subject of a legal Process that confirms or denies its Legality"
1596206367473508,2:37:31,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,@Anne M. Thanks. I havealready conceded the point to @mandla nkosi
1596206390245467,2:37:55,Anne M.,My bad @Luvuyo Zantsi
1596206405525190,2:38:10,Carl Botha,Why no long drawn out answers now?
1596206414348187,2:38:17,Pieter Engelbrecht,I'm interested to find out how many here are practicing law?
1596206424169205,2:38:26,Naledi Barron,@Jonathan Ganesh . I'm surprised that you are still listening/watching this inquiry. Or are you just here for your personal amusement?
1596206440815217,2:38:45,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,Nothing bad @Anne M. You were assisting.
1596206450653548,2:38:54,Sal SA,"Thabo Daily Maverick quote ""The Open Society Foundation found 136 people had gone through the process of “extraordinary rendition” and 54 countries were complicit in it, South Africa among them."""
1596206460375127,2:39:03,Albert Noah,What's the full name of Mr. July?
1596206463900626,2:39:06,Leon Mbangwa,We pray for Mr Mandilonga's soul. He died. Yes he did.
1596206480519518,2:39:24,Naledi Barron,@Jonathan Ganesh . Then I welcome your thoughtful commentary.

1596206539908100,2:40:23,Pieter Engelbrecht,what did i miss?
1596206559201643,2:40:43,Naledi Barron,@Pastor J . Eloquently stated.
1596206568823812,2:40:52,Madodana Tuntulwana,just listen
1596206607782702,2:41:31,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,@Albert Noah You're welcome

1596206675653002,2:42:38,Pastor J.J,@Naledi...Thank you my friend
1596206704336846,2:43:07,Pieter Engelbrecht,How does a second report remove information from the first one?
1596206710068378,2:43:13,Pieter Engelbrecht,could someone please explain that to me
1596206753361162,2:43:55,Naledi Barron,"@Jonathan Ganesh. Beyond your joviality, is ther perhaps a serious side ?"
1596206759676810,2:44:03,sifiso Mazibuko,corruption that is why it was removed
1596206765131895,2:44:07,Sal SA,Pieter it happens in business environments
1596206766248542,2:44:08,Danie Nilsen,bleachbit same as hillary clinten did
1596206772888270,2:44:15,Pieter Engelbrecht,"ok, so who draw up the second report?"
1596206788295164,2:44:31,Pastor J.J,@Pieter...If it is found to be Incorrect/Hearsay and or Unsubstantiated and so forth.
1596206799021181,2:44:42,Sal SA,same person
1596206823534313,2:45:05,Pieter Engelbrecht,"@Pastor J thanks, and i take that you need to submit that report with evidence that previous statements were in fact false?"
1596206843757553,2:45:26,Leon Mbangwa,@redeemed sinner Thus right. unfortunate that suspects of crime ran to the Commission and the evidence leaders failed to ask key questions. Now the commission evidence leaders are defending them
1596206860161080,2:45:42,Pastor J.J,@Pieter...Indeed so but not if it was simply a draft/working document
1596206885643425,2:46:09,Madodana Tuntulwana,"Pieter apologies, with due respect I cannot waste my time with you, it is clear you are not following this evidence and arguments"
1596206902093587,2:46:25,Danie Nilsen,it sounds to me this evidence leader are being paid by mc bride and company
1596206923096203,2:46:48,Naledi Barron,@Jonathan Ganesh. Sorry JG. 14 000 kms divides us. Now shush up and add meaningful commentary.
1596207010685558,2:48:13,Leon Mbangwa,@Daniel. Can't understand why McBride was even allowed to come and waste this Commission time. Hidden agendas at play
1596207033105043,2:48:36,Pieter Engelbrecht,@Madodana Tuntulwana thank you for you honesty 🙂
1596207067260010,2:49:10,Madodana Tuntulwana,Danie that is the exact picture we are unfortunately being given by the lead investigator.
1596207228691067,2:51:52,Leon Mbangwa,@Daniel McBride will head Foreign Intelligence. I think the qualifying criteria for the position is how much have you lied without being caught.
1596207258957233,2:52:22,Danie Nilsen,this is important people died here at least one
1596207306424504,2:53:10,Aubrey Milford,Danie all people are important
1596207339610505,2:53:42,Danie Nilsen,yes it is true even corrupt ones
1596207349223820,2:53:52,Aubrey Milford,what make one person more important than other...and who decides on this?
1596207363618405,2:54:06,Pieter Engelbrecht,i think i stayed because i find human behavior and interaction very interesting
1596207454419462,2:55:37,Naledi Barron,"@Jonathan Ganesh. Your levity has a laugh-by date. Again, I welcome your serious commentary as part of the commentary fabric."
1596207552522437,2:57:15,Naledi Barron,And before anybody thinks that S.A is the only government in trouble. Please think again - China is experiencing some serious Karma. The U.K is led by an utter buffoon. The U.S? I won't go there.
1596207578604330,2:57:41,Pieter Engelbrecht,dude you have stickies on your pages...no need to guess the page number
1596207620129364,2:58:23,Bradley Petersen,What k@k is this man on about now?
1596207623004001,2:58:26,Danie Nilsen,as well closer to home africa is not a prism of an etopia in corrupt officials
1596207623667393,2:58:26,Naledi Barron,@Jonathan Ganesh . Not going anywhere. Am interested in this inquiry.
1596207661406506,2:59:05,Pieter Engelbrecht,prima facie : accepted until proven otherwise for those that do not know

1596207844899349,3:02:06,Leon Mbangwa,"DCJ you got to do something. Khuba lied to you. Sisoko lied to you, McBride lied to you. Bayadelela!"
1596207853947355,3:02:17,Pieter Engelbrecht,"@Jonathan Ganesh you're a silly dude and that's cool, just be careful about your audience."
1596207865011105,3:02:28,MIKE DURBAN,Bless everyone....and especially.......SA.......we need it badly............
1596207865989278,3:02:29,Pieter Engelbrecht,@Naledi Barron don't feed a troll.
1596207878521270,3:02:41,Bradley Petersen,lol
1596207919912142,3:03:23,Naledi Barron,"@Jonathan Ganesh. I think you're on/in the wrong forum. Please get lost. Thanks @Pieter Engelbrecht , I'm wide awake!"
1596207921651131,3:03:24,Bradley Petersen,BREAKING NEWS: Cigarette ban has been lifted
1596207931241529,3:03:34,MIKE DURBAN,Yahooo......Puza time........Cheers...
1596208079671097,3:06:02,MIKE DURBAN,Hey Guys.......Johnny Walker/Castle time.......relax dudes......
1596208107955159,3:06:31,Naledi Barron,"@Bradley Petersen. Hopefully peeps have taken up vaping, instead of cigarettes."
1596208119235336,3:06:42,Bradley Petersen,looks like everyone in the courts needs a beer
1596208122588037,3:06:45,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,July clears Nhleko
1596208153827442,3:07:15,MIKE DURBAN,Yebo...........Bring on the Curry Bunnies as well......heheh
1596208194686035,3:07:57,mandla nkosi,@Luvuyo. I agree with you
1596208224241192,3:08:26,Conproc zambia limited,no..this is so nice...... irrelevant he said
1596208268236573,3:09:12,Pieter Engelbrecht,maybe a final question...who's funding this commision?
1596208319892862,3:10:02,Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,The allegation was that Nhleko appointed Werksman as a hit squad. That is being seriously challenged.
1596208398908331,3:11:22,Pieter Engelbrecht,"@Jonathan Ganesh one problem, money is power...we don't have that."
1596208495083182,3:12:57,Sithembiso Mahlaba,Judge Zondo won't find the truth in this commision
1596208496403069,3:12:58,Pieter Engelbrecht,"retracting messages only hide them in chat, still captured at a data farm."
1596208501156665,3:13:04,Thembelani Ndlazi,@Luvuyo Zantsi anyone still thinking McBride has nothing to answer must listen and think again. Ngamanyala la
1596208515862352,3:13:18,Pieter Engelbrecht,wait..

1596208558117813,3:14:01,MIKE DURBAN,"Lets start a movement.......""Jail For Capture"".....or something.........heheh"
1596208560881889,3:14:04,Leon Mbangwa,The meaning of hit squad is misunderstood by certain people
1596208567281480,3:14:10,Pieter Engelbrecht,yes

1596208684570362,3:16:07,gapieo,"on chi nothing, chi is a test ."
1596208718308215,3:16:41,Pieter Engelbrecht,wow..we went from inquiry to internet explorer to chi

1596208840198824,3:18:43,Naledi Barron,"@Pieter Engelbrecht . Bottom line is this - manage what you can, influence where you can, stand your ground. The grass is always greener on the other side until you step into the s**t."
1596208853812758,3:18:57,Pieter Engelbrecht,@Naledi Barron so true.
1596208859239242,3:19:03,gapieo,we geven money to incompetent leaders
1596208871887974,3:19:16,gapieo,geen cent meet
1596208895789179,3:19:39,gapieo,boycott south africa like before
1596208895921258,3:19:39,Pieter Engelbrecht,"dude, not to offend, but i don't understand that last statement"
1596208907223044,3:19:50,gapieo,they have not learned
1596208932583653,3:20:16,Naledi Barron,"@Pieter Engelbrecht . Old Portuguese saying.... The s**t is the same, it's just the flies that are different. Sterkte!"
