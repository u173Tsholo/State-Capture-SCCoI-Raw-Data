1558080083686185,33:20,Sasha,"This man is well spoken ,concise and articulate.Our ministers should be more like this,not the useless cadres that are deployed"
1558080104401719,33:41,Meshikiah Empire,This is going to be interesting
1558080131758050,34:08,Magda Seguin,Eastern Cape Premier elect in new scandal.A new Bentley costing R4m and house renovations in question
1558080179222737,34:55,Robert Russell,You seem surprised.......????? @Magda Seguin
1558080200357649,35:16,Felix Muyoba,anyone can be a learned and articulate as long he/she given an opportunity..
1558080358631973,37:55,Granny Mokwena,trolls should be ignored completely! They eventually disappear into thin air..
1558080477183498,39:53,Magda Seguin,"Not really @Robert Russell,CR even asked that the HPCSA be investigated,apparently bribes were paid to get doctors registered."
1558080600598586,41:57,S'bo N,i doubt @Rubin Naidoo
1558080661990476,42:58,Granny Mokwena,the whole of them looted SA
1558080731896451,44:08,UN- DILUTED,looters must be brought to book ... watching from europe
1558081086828399,50:03,Norman Zwane,@Rubin Naidoo From what I hear None. All departments were infected with this looting streak. I would be suprised if I was told otherwise.
1558081149001449,51:05,Magda Seguin,I may be mistaken but didn't the Guptas have majority shares in China South Rail?
1558081197505141,51:53,Magda Seguin,The billions paid to CSR was never paid back as they never provided anything
1558081270969953,53:07,Robert Russell,Nope no share holding.... only kick backs via Issa and a Hong Kong shelf company @Magda Seguin
1558081272154553,53:09,Derek Main,@Rubin Naidoo No - all levels of government have been corrupted by the ANC
1558081287508204,53:24,Magda Seguin,"@Rubin Naidoo I know the feeling,I can go back anytime as I still have interests in SA but I am hesitating"
1558081311171687,53:47,Born free,I do wish that the railway system could be resurrected so that these heavy duty transporting Trucks do not have to be on the roads which would also reduce maintenance costs.Army must safeguard trains.
1558081337316159,54:13,Khalid Mather,Mohammed Mohammedy... connection :O
1558081338489287,54:14,Magda Seguin,Thanks @Robert Russell my head is spinning with all the details..its becoming hard to keep up
1558081351758615,54:28,Granny Mokwena,truth is if most of us had the means to start over anywhere we would
1558081369501011,54:45,Khalid Mather,"@Val Speirs exact;ly , go try and navigate the bluff in Durban at night, its horrible"
1558081389201416,55:05,Magda Seguin,Oh Yes@Robert Russell I remember the shelf company now
1558081395038662,55:11,Robert Russell,You might have been confused with Denel and VR Laser
1558081513451081,57:10,Magda Seguin,@Granny Mokwena there was a time I cried every day listening to this commission..its soul destroying especially knowing the majority of SA people are struggling and poor
1558081563878381,58:00,Felix Muyoba,the english in general have bad manners..the guy doesnt even address the dcj as chair as per norm..
1558081570096241,58:06,Magda Seguin,"Yes I was confused @Robert Russell,I need to check my notes again"
1558081572623550,58:08,king James aka 50pac B.I.G makaveil,more show
1558081671725314,59:48,Born free,As long as he makes eye contact with Judge Zondo it's fine one does not have to keep referring to the Chair. I think his manners are impeccable.
1558081689713923,1:00:06,Robert Russell,I agree with you Magda..... about the poor people suffering even more than they deserve too... imagine what a R140 MILLION could do instead of the ANC spending this on a party for CR next week
1558081699034414,1:00:15,Felix Muyoba,@Val Speirs no man..
1558081768682356,1:01:24,Magda Seguin,If they made a gesture to have a small ceremony it would have showed compassion and integrity
1558081780679884,1:01:37,Born free,Ramaphosa should just be sworn in.. no party celebrations in this terrible economic climate.
1558081825580319,1:02:21,Magda Seguin,R140m just for one day..

1558081986694242,1:05:02,Robert Russell,I think he should be sworn AT for allowing this waste of money
1558082000481336,1:05:17,Bridgette Kekana,Magda this money is too much Anc cant think properly
1558082036102707,1:05:52,Magda Seguin,I see on Twitter that people are not happy about the inauguration flamboyancy and spending

1558082133956137,1:07:30,Born free,Imagine if the money had been spent on service delivery and uplifting the poor what a difference it could have made to these communities... but that is not what happened.
1558082135837427,1:07:31,Magda Seguin,Out if the 32 thousand invited only 10 thousand 'ordinary'South Africans are allowed as 'walk ins'...those who have no cars will not stand a chance.
1558082233366342,1:09:10,Magda Seguin,"@Bridgette Kekana Me too,I hope we will not have more bad news next Tuesday with the Cabinet choices of CR"
1558082237950895,1:09:15,Born free,The Rich have heaven on earth the poor remain the same.

1558082482147588,1:13:18,Jabu Malinga,Pravin Gordan will be deduty president
1558082491414348,1:13:28,Felix Muyoba,@Jabu Malinga it is because the evidence being given today is rubbish..i dont get this english guy is saying..i think even the dcj is not following well..

1558082515497277,1:13:52,Granny Mokwena,the ANC has no will power to even try stamp out corruption!
1558082515626330,1:13:52,Pheladi Lamola,And they will spend more millions on the SONA after the Loftus shindig.
1558082537589592,1:14:14,Lorna Kavanagh,Were the 1064 locomotives ever delivered? and was the gauge correct?
1558082557053311,1:14:32,Born free,Protest against the expenditure of this Inauguration.

1558082626051070,1:15:42,Magda Seguin,I am sick in bed today but the commission is too important to miss

1558082762666412,1:17:59,Born free,Ramophosa surely cannot elect people who have been implicated in corruption in this commission of enquiry.
1558082800508652,1:18:36,Bridgette Kekana,Nomvula has been implicated
1558082848180518,1:19:24,Magda Seguin,@Lorna Kavanagh as far as I gathered it was never delivered but the money was never returned
1558082850924507,1:19:27,Wildthing,Val that's 85% of the ANC
1558082881091216,1:19:57,Born free,NDZ was captured and is linked to the Guptas.
1558082901367307,1:20:18,James Godloza Godloza,if President Rama exclude those who are implicated in this commission then the will be no one in parliament to represent the anc coz they are all corrupt

1558082934548951,1:20:51,Jabu Malinga,There will be no change ppl. get that out ya heads. Ramaphosa promised a lot of favors to win at Nasarec. DD and the like have to now be accommodated.

1558082975499936,1:21:31,Robert Russell,From what I understand... the ANC NEC makes up the list of members to parly.... the President picks his Cabinet from this list.....
1558082983858165,1:21:41,Jabu Malinga,what makes u think he will suddenly appoint ppl who are not implicated
1558082986889448,1:21:44,Felix Muyoba,how can you attend the meeting without being authorised to do so? english arrogance
1558083014286578,1:22:10,Jabu Malinga,even he is implicated in som things lik marikana. small nyara skeletons. everybody has them
1558083060977698,1:22:57,Jabu Malinga,why are the group of ministers called a cabinet? isn't it a cabaal

1558083839877389,1:35:56,Robert Russell,@Jabu Malinga the answer is simple.... NPA = NEVER PROSECUTE THE ANC
1558083859200821,1:36:15,Born free,Arrests will be forth coming this commission is listening to the testimony of witnesses first.
1558083860004943,1:36:16,Magda Seguin,But I also believe there is a concerted effort in the 21st century that spread ageism...making older people out to be fools is not intelligent at all.Sages are to be respected.
1558083861716662,1:36:18,Mzalwane Mzala,Linda Mti was arrested so it is not true that only Agrizzi was arrested

1558083891094645,1:36:47,Pheladi Lamola,@Jabu Malinga I think Agrizzi was arrested so that he wouldn't testify at that commission which was dealing with Snake and Snail.
1558083919604256,1:37:15,Magda Seguin,Jiba and Mwerebi should have been arrested and charged for obstruction of justice

1558085814584069,2:08:50,Magda Seguin,And I am sure if fracking was allowed a lot more state capture was going to happen knowing what I learnt from this commission
