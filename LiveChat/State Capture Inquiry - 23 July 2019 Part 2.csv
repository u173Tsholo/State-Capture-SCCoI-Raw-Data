1563893749337463,2:48:07,Derek Main,"@Jabu Malinga As much as it saddens me to say it, that's probably the wisest choice. The future looks bleak here with the ANC in charge."
1563893752506950,2:48:10,Martin De Beer,"Sorry, if Knights.. say something worthwhile please let me know. I blocked him cause wigs is hardly the topic...."
1563893786449963,2:48:45,Mr C,AFRICA IS IN THE HANDS OF HEARTLESS PPLE AND THEY DONT CARE ABOUT ANYONE
1563893795610536,2:48:54,Pastor J.J,@Some guy .Just kidding buddy. U are absolutely right. What is private should remain private and respected.
1563893799245556,2:48:57,Jabu Malinga,if you have a million dollars u can become a citizen of Cyprus and have access to any other EU country and another 50 countries around d world
1563893811598239,2:49:09,Knight Wolves United FC,We are not AFRIKANS PLEASE GO AND TELL MBEKI WE are Bantu PEOPLE from the THEE GREAT NORTH
1563893812529932,2:49:10,Makwa Choma,If white people did enough to earn our trust we should not find ourself in this situation
1563893824858057,2:49:23,Martin De Beer,"Only Boesak and schabir shaik went to jail, for a small while though"
1563893833080462,2:49:31,Jabu Malinga,"who would want to live in SA when u could get a safe, 1st world life abroad"

1563893878198559,2:50:16,Derek Main,@Makwa Choma I'm not sure it's the whites you should be worried about. Look at what the ANC government has done to this country with their brazen looting.
1563893904089908,2:50:43,Dominic Przybylski,@Makwa Choma What must white people do to earn trust when they are called land thieves and threatened with having their homes taken from them simply because of the colour of their skin?
1563893909546320,2:50:47,Knight Wolves United FC,AND this is SOUTH AZANIA AND ZIMBABWE AND MOZAMBIQUE AR THE NORTH AZANIA
1563893920691547,2:50:58,Some guy,@Diss why do u want me to admit something that's not the truth?
1563893929243201,2:51:08,Jabu Malinga,"SA is a great country. we have everytin,sea, sun, wild life, sports, things are relatively cheap compared to Europe, but crime and corruption is killing this country"
1563893949621422,2:51:26,Martin De Beer,@Jabu Malinga Well said.

1563894265091038,2:56:43,Pastor J.J,@Diss & Dad Perhaps you should now start considering the fact that you may be crossing the line of respectability. @Some guy made it clear that it is personal and this is not the forum.
1563894285423098,2:57:03,Knight Wolves United FC,hOW LONG WILL ANIMAL IN THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS CALLED ZOOS BE FRREEED ONE DAY
1563894286187050,2:57:04,Jabu Malinga,government mus not allow any child to be out of school or trade school. it must be a crime if any parent does not send there child to school
1563894286822502,2:57:04,Some guy,no I haven't read that.
1563894294147243,2:57:12,Mr C,@Jabu Malinga CAN YOU SAY THOSE GUYS FROM ZIMBABWE ARE WORKING OR ITS SLAVERY? TEELL ME WHY ARE THEY NOT DOING THE HARD WORK IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY

1563894320371212,2:57:38,Dominic Przybylski,Crime is only other option if a person cannot earn a living.
1563894333885737,2:57:51,Jabu Malinga,there is no jobs in Zim or did u forget what Mugabe did to that country??
1563894337785356,2:57:55,Some guy,@Pastor J. thanks bro.... no I feel like Zuma being cross examined 😂😂😂😂
1563894339357337,2:57:57,Makwa Choma,Both blacks n white needed each other hence am saying if white people did enough to earn our trust we should have not being in this mess
1563894347626653,2:58:06,Anne M.,@Jabu Malinga I think it is already law that all children up to a certain age must attend school. Problem for some parents is the cost of transport to get their children to school.
1563894347828298,2:58:06,Some guy,now*
1563894356261579,2:58:14,Jabu Malinga,zim guys are more skilled and more educated..1 thing Mugabe insisted on was education
1563894397975304,2:58:55,Jabu Malinga,"Anne, yes, its hard, but government mus put the money there then.. no child mus be without money to reach school or without food"
1563894454590394,2:59:52,Some guy,ya I'm just now sure why ure so interested in interogating my personal life on a public chat.
1563894462632141,3:00:00,Dominic Przybylski,@Makwa Choma Problem is that whites have culture centred on individual while blacks have culture centred on the masses. So very difficult to find common ground.

1563895103408426,3:10:41,Dominic Przybylski,The only thing which will destroy me is if I don't look after myself. If I can do that successfully then I can help somebody else prevent their life being destroyed. Politicians don't scare me.
