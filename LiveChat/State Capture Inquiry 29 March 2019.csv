1553846476334710,26:47,Madelein R,I don't think they will be charged (the people that came to the commission). Zondo express his concern regarding Agrizzi's arrest yesterday. He said that it will discourage people to spill the beans

1553847154997403,38:05,mphumudzeni siphuma,Ramaphosa is not innocent too.lets give mangosuthu buthelezi for presidency
1553847156253315,38:06,Isihlahla Samabhinca,so because people were claiming that Zuma is the who is the most corrupt in the ANC what will happen about the current president since he was implicated ??

1553847172966118,38:22,MIKE DURBAN,@Phillip Moshapo ...SPOT ON....They are ALL involved.

1553847295352870,40:26,makhosi nobhatyi,@ Davids Jacobs what did Ramaphosa steal? Did you hear his name appeared here? He explained about R500 000 so I don’t think he is part of this state capture and he is been investigated
1553847297171968,40:28,Magda Seguin,Andile should be subpeonaed
1553847306655621,40:37,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi As long as he's not expecting forgiveness. All these criminals must serve time.
1553847318461134,40:48,carnoth ngomane,@Isihlahla Samabhinca yes his son not him
1553847331528550,41:01,Magda Seguin,The ANC anti CR faction is trying to frame him

1553847365255230,41:35,Derek Main,Ramaphosa gave us the spin on the R500K - the real truth will come out soon.
1553847368458499,41:38,Big vinny,I'm surprised that Andile Ramaphosa is guilty of any crime for him be arrested what crime did he commit besides doing business with a registered company Bosasa
1553847370666969,41:40,Ntombethemba Manase,"Cyril is not yet implicated, atleast for now."
1553847384589920,41:54,Myka'Al Daud,All of ths thieves explain n get investigated until we all forget about their corruption
1553847391319962,42:01,carnoth ngomane,@makhosi nobhatyi people yearn for Ramaphosa to be implicated at all cost
1553847403693630,42:14,Isihlahla Samabhinca,ANC killed MAGAQA and that Mayor is walking free
1553847405808024,42:16,makhosi nobhatyi,"We must look broadly what happened to Ramaphosa, he was targeted easy sport to get him was involved son not like Zuma who was a friend of Guptas"

1553847424772725,42:34,Magda Seguin,Andile should testify to clear his name if he was only in b
1553847426154161,42:36,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane All ANC MPs are implicated - they protected Zuma for years.
1553847430264885,42:40,Michael Michael,Manase myb someone like Dudu gonna mention him
1553847449693995,42:59,Eslon Eslon,I think Cyril panicked when the Bosasa payment was brought in parliament. He lied blindly.
1553847465913593,43:15,Madelein R,@Ntombethemba Manase - Cyril received contributions from them for his election? The interesting question is - Did he ask for if? Or did they just give it?

1553847568564563,44:59,Magda Seguin,Apparently he never requested money...it was offered by Watson to his son...could have been a setup.Remember it happened just before the ANC Nasrec conference..The ANC wanted NDZ to win
1553847570309636,45:01,Lloyd Sherewa,Put Agrizzi on a government payroll 😂😂😂

1553849913509190,1:24:03,Albert Noah,Agrizzi has photographic memory if he is not making up this stuff. I would wait for cross-examination
1553849914830594,1:24:05,Magda Seguin,Remember Agrizzi testified that the tenders specifications was drawn up by Gillingham and Smith...Watson and both of them should be arrested on that evidence alone
1553849915292646,1:24:05,K-bee Mablack Moalosi,Lewele Jeremiah why would you respect a criminal?

1553850129786777,1:27:40,makhosi nobhatyi,Agrizzi knew that time like this will come it may be thrown to him as he sign and other coz Gavin Watson doesn’t signs showing that all he was going to do was to put all blame those who signed
1553850134668032,1:27:44,Magda Seguin,Fact is @Innocent...it was taxpayers money and the ANC knew it
1553850135217590,1:27:45,thobekani ncube,angelo remembers too much......

1553850170843014,1:28:21,Ntombethemba Manase,Yes Ramaphosa is very weak because he never agreed to be corrupted.
1553850173200546,1:28:23,brian fakazi,Ramaphosa knows very well that if he touches corruption he will be tainting with ANC primary policy
1553850187547544,1:28:38,Wildthing,if it was not true there would be a line at the police station laying charges against him for telling lies and defamation of character. so think about that.
1553850196626142,1:28:46,Magda Seguin,Check on Google...lots of photos of Zuma with Watson..even Zumas birthday cake had Bosasa logos on
1553850200437499,1:28:50,Michael Michael,Fakazi incorrect

1553852397183117,2:05:19,Malux Xihahele,My advise is that we should not get married to political parties. we should list our expectations to any we vote for and if they do not deliver we change our vote to someone else.

1553852409622348,2:05:31,Derek Main,@carnoth ngomane Yes you could ask that. I don't mind if people vote for any political party after giving it some thought. But to blindly vote for a party no matter what they do is just stupid.

1553856876093879,3:19:57,Evolving Humanity,I don't understand how people can still trust in the ANC. They are not delivering on their promises. South Africa will never go back to an apartheid regime under white rule. Ppl need to not fear that.
1553856895788805,3:20:17,Precious Ntshangase,"@Isihlahla Samabhinca ...oh yes, Zuma has files of all of them. Thats why they let him to run amok. Zuma wont go to jail, believe that."
