1580983853898103,2:05:20,Elvis Malakoane,can
1580984021694503,2:08:07,Anne M.,@Elvis Malakoane Many years ago (in the early 1900s and earlier) Europeans fathers used to pay the prospective grooms a dowry - opposite to what is done in South Africa.
1580984138602775,2:10:04,Anne M.,Indian people (in India) still exchange money and jewellery.
1580984265701963,2:12:11,L. M,let it be clear and known that paying a dowry is NOT a commercial transaction whatsoever
1580984405588037,2:14:31,roza,this is sooo boring today
1580984414816505,2:14:40,Anne M.,@lawrence muhle Are you saying lobola is a commercial transaction?
1580984449149641,2:15:15,roza,the dowry system is banned in india
1580984496587526,2:16:01,L. M,"Nada, please re-read my statement @Anne M."
1580984612328218,2:17:58,Anne M.,"@lawrence muhle I never said the (European) dowry was a commercial transaction, so not sure why you stated that. Back then, women who did not have a dowry did not get married."
1580984615332886,2:18:01,roza,i think lobola is a form of respect shown to the bride nd her family i may be wrong plz correct me if i am
1580984653177982,2:18:39,Anti Suz,"Traditionally with Afrikaans people, the bride's parents pay for the wedding. The groom/his parents usually pays for the booze."

1580984807174959,2:21:12,Paul Buchel,@Anti Suz‚Äã The booze account cost more at my wedding
1580984814114099,2:21:20,L. M,"i stated that because it an insinuation from other people in this chat. And yes of course, even in the African tradition you cannot marry BEFORE you pay a dowry."
1580984882376770,2:22:27,L. M,"that goes the same if you did not pay ""damages"" if there are any @Anne M."
1580985273868416,2:29:00,Anne M.,"@lawrence muhle Please tell me about ""damages."
1580985361788696,2:30:27,L. M,"if i impregnated a lady before paying lobola then i have to ""pay"" for that PLUS the dowry"
1580985468983674,2:32:15,Anne M.,"Aha, thanks."
