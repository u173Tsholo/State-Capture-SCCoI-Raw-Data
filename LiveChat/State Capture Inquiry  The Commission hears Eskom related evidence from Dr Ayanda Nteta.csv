1610440673437409,34:57,FieliesSA,"@Paul Amoomo Its just curiosity. There had been people testifying that claim they are CA or Dr's, but when we check their linkedIN profiles its a different story"
1610440696702088,35:20,Diane Louw,very fishy sorry to say
1610440699012301,35:23,Herb Tuck,No it relaxes my brain 
1610440726247724,35:50,Steve,The race issue always gets raised as a last resort because there is no argument. She was in on the theft and crime at Eskom
1610440747479244,36:12,Paul Amoomo,Have anyone questioned yours or the colour of your skin gave you privileges?
1610440781182111,36:45,Steve,To discuss race issues with you would be futile and waste of time
1610440785652708,36:49,Singi Mathebula,"confusing, she was frog match from the building and allowed to serve a one month notice? HR family members, please assist with the interpretation."
1610440801535296,37:06,Gerard Victor,@ take it up with Jan v Riebeeck or keep your opinions to yourself
1610440807633654,37:11,G. Classens,@Diana Louw no I like her at all

1610440848883746,37:52,FieliesSA,@Paul Amoomo I did not cause or participate in state capture so my qualifications dont matter. But I see you are very sensitive to this. Just chill we all friends
1610440893604015,38:37,VigoSun,Playing stupid again. you do remember why are you lying?
1610440903576913,38:47,Diane Louw,people must stop using race as an excuse!!!
1610440937594832,39:22,VigoSun,Ja well crime is classified by race in this country. everything is about race.
1610440956205282,39:40,Steve,"I am so sick of this race card being played. If you stole or assisted corruption, then take the blame. Race has nothing to do with it"
1610440988350615,40:11,Heather Durr,@Paul Amoomo Because she is a woman 
1610441031737978,40:55,FieliesSA,"@Minnib Prince We are all here together against corruption. But some completely miss it, blinded by race issues"

1610441410549131,47:14,FieliesSA,"The devil might be in the detail. She might have left Eskom for the right reason, but is she acted biased(w.r.t. contract), then she is implicated..."
1610441411684427,47:15,Singi Mathebula,"But what has race to do with corruption? we cannot when defeated in a discussion hide behind race. it's a fact, the ANC has disappointed a lot of poor blacks ."

1610441846865427,54:31,VigoSun,I understand the frustration though. The same people in poverty vote the same crooks that don't implement jobs or lack the ability to make such changes. more like eat words not food.
1610441849352281,54:34,Santa Kriel,@Paul Amoomo there is no way to change a person's mindset on who that person wants to be. no debate will change that. a waste of time
