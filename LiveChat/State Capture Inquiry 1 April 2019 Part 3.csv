1554122184920711,34:52,Desmond Masilela,@Poland Man. I guess is april fool
1554122252049394,35:58,Christiaan Kleynhans,I have a feeling some people with power are cutting this stream. The ANC does not want us to know. We could see it over the weekend as well. They will fabricate open lies to protect themselves.
1554122254715310,36:01,welton paulse,@Pieter Torlage seems like it just ended.
1554122278065930,36:25,Nelson Musoliwa,As tax payers we are the sponsors of this commission and u are depriving us to witness this process now it is unfair
1554122290456862,36:37,welton paulse,prematurely ended

1554122368037302,37:54,Gift Nyathi,SABC has been scammed no picture no sound...
1554122385490388,38:12,Derek Main,@Pieter Torlage The first step would be to get rid of the ANC. It will never end while they are in power.
1554122390141750,38:16,Magda Seguin,Last week the sounds were as if a short circuit is being attempted...I may be wrong but it is suspucious
1554122420389952,38:47,Richardt Human,@derek main absolutely
1554122457833924,39:24,michael mbatha,SIU bosses and Mr Watson have cut the feed.
1554122458317903,39:24,Born free,State Capture is supposed to be finalised by May? It is more likely to be an ANC ploy to win the election and then the State will be captured once again by more corruption.
1554122470509986,39:36,Magda Seguin,Are the same captured state security officials still in employ?
1554122485886180,39:52,wendy hardy,Is this sabotage?
1554122516343649,40:23,Hone—É,ooooh

1554122525353630,40:32,Lebo Nchabeleng,@Pieter I guess the state capture will only end of all this political parties uses the money from their own pockets for campaigns n not take money from business people
1554122531785459,40:38,postmaster,for sure sabotage of stream
1554122532200849,40:39,Robert Russell,@Magda Seguin ....maybe not... but the captured politicians are still in power....

1554122561470294,41:08,Derek Main,@The Truth Any party but the ANC. There is no other party as corrupt as them.
1554122565342181,41:11,Pumlile Qengwa,It could be that some big shot got scared names were to be mentioned
1554122572068789,41:18,The Truth,"Corruption is a global phenom. I‚Äôm just proud that SA is dealing with it, publicly and robustly"
1554122588174415,41:34,erin collective,"but enca stream is unlisted, you can find it on their website, wont show up if you go to their channel"
1554122604904413,41:51,Derek Main,@The Truth Look at the ANC election lists - they are not dealing with corruption.
1554122623350922,42:10,Christiaan Kleynhans,Looks like SSA Bosasa is on this line.
1554122649274066,42:36,Derek Main,@The Truth As I've said numerous times - voting for the ANC to get rid of corruption is like americans voting for the Ku Klux Klan to get rid of racial prejudice.
1554122666107107,42:52,Wallace Mandimutsira,"banking details for who now , hello"
1554122673102565,42:59,Christiaan Kleynhans,Haven't they heard of fibre yet?
1554122677949708,43:04,Robert Russell,STRATCOM is on strike.....
1554122698624841,43:24,The Truth,"@Derek Main Then you are delusional and subtly racist to think corruption is synonymous to SA. Corruption is far worse in other countries such as US. It is well hidden, and never dealt with."
1554122720875096,43:47,Born free,Bosasa paid cash bribes
1554122810151575,45:17,Born free,Was Oellerman paid a cash bribe.. possibly

1554123441613764,55:48,Magda Seguin,Agrizzi said the exact same thing
1554123523326066,57:09,Derek Main,@The Truth Show me how I'm racist. I put it to you that you pulling the race card makes YOU the racist.
1554123566596041,57:53,Sophia Maholela,"@Val Speirs , in their minds they told themselves they would never be caught"
1554123588131559,58:14,Danie Nilsen,this is a purpose fully sound and visual atack by some guilty persons and realy succeeding mabe the same that have sanitizes the servers

1554123777748625,1:01:24,Derek Main,"@The Truth And by the way, I have never said that corruption only happens in SA. Only a fool ANC supporter would make such a ridiculous assertion."
1554123813971530,1:02:00,zan morris,oh no plz
1554123876102678,1:03:02,Robert Russell,@Derek Main ....ANC supporter <80..... tells it all... no hope....KFC and a T Shirt for his vote...
1554123944575509,1:04:11,Derek Main,@Robert Russell Yep - corruption at all levels - even buying votes.
1554123961443935,1:04:27,Magda Seguin,What is so sad is that so many people did their work diligently and honestly and was victimised until they resigned or they were suspended for having done nothing wrong ruining their lives
1554124001289930,1:05:07,Derek Main,@The Truth I'm waiting...
1554124001360245,1:05:07,Magda Seguin,After all this I think those affected must sue the state in a class action
1554124017938329,1:05:24,Robert Russell,@Magda Seguin .... that's the ANC for you....
1554124118589317,1:07:05,Magda Seguin,"The honourable thing would be for the ANC to resign from government,in other democratic countries the government would have fallen already but the ANC has no ethics or honour"
1554124148651249,1:07:35,Magda Seguin,"Betrayal,corruption and treason"
1554124154299125,1:07:40,Sophia Maholela,"@ Ewald kruger they thought they would be protected forever, how naive!!"

1554124158075239,1:07:44,Robert Russell,Staying on the subject.... all the companies that lost out on tenders to BOSASA should do a class action against the ANC.... not the government... to claim back lost profits and costs...
1554124161930853,1:07:48,Marietjie Larney,ANC makes promises before the elections but never keeps the promises AFTER the elections. Only fools believe them
1554124208947435,1:08:35,Magda Seguin,@Robert Russell that will be the first and best to do
1554124219374328,1:08:46,Elia Maarman,"With all these commissions, seems that the taxpayers money just been waisted here. Especially this Agrizzi person, Judge Zondo give this racist guy too much airtime"
1554124220690416,1:08:47,Derek Main,"@Marietjie Larney Yeah - like the ""New Dawn"" joke."
1554124240399665,1:09:07,Sophia Maholela,"Robert Russell, I agree with you because they did not lose business on principles, and then BOsasa ,and BOsasa should be liquidated, they benefited unfairly"

1554124396584525,1:11:43,Robert Russell,The ANC should be sued for keeping corrupt ministers in positions when they (the ANC) knew they were corrupt but yet let the stealing as a collective continue to be thieves...

1554124439674232,1:12:26,Derek Main,@Robert Russell The only reason the ANC did that is because they are all corrupt.

1554124461794972,1:12:48,R hunter,"Yup, its like dealing with little kids that demand sweets from Mom at the counter"

1554124588486951,1:14:55,Derek Main,@Danie Nilsen I thought he would have marched him to the police station long ago. Never trust what comes out of an ANC politician's mouth.
1554124601436219,1:15:07,Elia Maarman,"u know till this racist testimony is not tested, it will remain allegation, clear this is DA propaganda when one look at the whole saga."

1554124643038698,1:15:50,Norman Zwane,"@Robert Russell But how? Take the m down, I agree, but how?"
1554124660153976,1:16:06,Derek Main,@maarman Maarman So you think the DA is controlling the state capture commission? You must be an ANC supporter.
1554124689306787,1:16:35,Magda Seguin,In the Free State they used the health budget for other things...The healthcare and hospitals in the FS is a disgrace
1554124723968382,1:17:10,Norman Zwane,"@maarman Maarman Test it to your heart;s content, either side, heads or tails it still a f''**cken bad penny."

1554128157135422,2:14:24,Derek Main,@The Truth Why not? There is enough evidence already for the police and NPA to investigate and charge people. Why hasn't it happened? Because this is just a time-wasting exercise.
1554128189705814,2:14:56,Derek Main,@The Truth Look at what happened with the Arms Deal Inquiry. A white-wash. Same could happen here.

1554128343308940,2:17:30,Derek Main,@The Truth You don't seem to be getting my point. We have a police force and an NPA - we should have to wait for commissions of inquiry before they do their jobs.

1554128881758848,2:26:28,Derek Main,"@The Truth In all the corruption we are hearing about here, there is one common denominator - the ANC."
1554128917021133,2:27:04,Andrew Mboweni,so then my question is what is the solutions to all this messs government of the african national congress what is the solutrions to all this
1554128920088978,2:27:06,MIKE DURBAN,@Derek Main ..just can't help themselves.....the Commies taught them well i reckon.

1554129005752147,2:28:32,Classic Assassin,The DA also has corrupt elements in its rank and sooner or later the s----t will hit the fan
1554129020941497,2:28:47,Derek Main,@Andrew Mboweni None more so than the ANC.
1554129049400028,2:29:16,Derek Main,@Classic Assassin Take it to the commission.
1554129076409442,2:29:43,Andrew Mboweni,@Derek Main which politcal party is the solution to a better south africa then

1554129095912856,2:30:01,Derek Main,"@The Truth If you were a patriot, you wouldn't vote for the ANC - they have destroyed SA."
1554129116854418,2:30:23,MIKE DURBAN,I reckon the DA is the Lesser of ALL the Evils.......fact

1554129153562726,2:30:59,jeevan singh,We need a new party. I think come next term I will revive the NIC. Natal Indian Congress. This liberation party was established in 1894. but joined the ANC in the 50s.
1554129153981081,2:31:00,Derek Main,"@Andrew Mboweni Quite frankly, any party would be better than the ANC."
1554129165018171,2:31:11,Andrew Mboweni,can the government establish a platform to eveluate which polical party is best for south africa as the anc failed same as verwoerd s party
1554129189651500,2:31:36,Classic Assassin,"MIKE LOCK = correct,they have more credible people than the so call beloved ANC"
1554129209094623,2:31:55,Derek Main,@Andrew Mboweni Maybe that's because they merged with verwoerd's party.
1554129262074729,2:32:48,Classic Assassin,Verwoerd' grandson is a ANC voter
1554129268296228,2:32:54,Andrew Mboweni,there must be a solution to solve all this mess without a talk show like all the commissions i think it is time to need real leadership cyril ramaphosa is also not a trusted man from the look of thing
1554129298935273,2:33:25,peter pott,this investigator is lying. I don't think mti allowed someone to search his house in his absence
1554129319486938,2:33:45,Derek Main,@Andrew Mboweni I agree with you - we need something fresh. No baggage. Devolution of power to the people.
1554129345773958,2:34:12,The Truth,"@Derek Main Where I grew up, ANC built houses, schools, roads, electricity, a hospital, within 15 years. The previous government never did so in 100 years. Go figure. Yes it‚Äôs not perfect, no world is"

1554129420113227,2:35:26,Derek Main,@The Truth You're probably talking of the OLD ANC. When they still had principles. What we are dealing with now is an entirely different animal. Corrupt to the core.
