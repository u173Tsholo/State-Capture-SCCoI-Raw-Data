1551361810987562,1:00:37,Quintin Jacobs,ubaba is a great strategist
1551361814225784,1:00:40,Eslon Eslon,Zuma had arms deal case hanging before becoming anc president but the ANC fools ignored Thambo Mbeki warning and went ahead to elect president
1551361834014262,1:00:59,M T,John - where do you reside now? Not still in SA?

1551366105316772,2:12:10,Yvonne Morudu,James we need stability.. my appeal to you white south Africans even if you don't like ANC let's all vote Cyril to give him mandate
1551366199379396,2:13:44,M T,I will NEVER vote for Cyril - EVER! Billionaire in a matter of a decade - and certainly not due to business acumen 🤮
1551366200314567,2:13:45,Huntley Cronje,"Yvonne Morudu - I really like Cyril, but the problem, when you vote ANC, the top 6 can still throw out who you thought you were voting for, and the NEC is corrupt."

1551366268108594,2:14:53,M T,NEC must ALL be kitted in Orange - why do you think they’ve stuck together?
1551366275190857,2:15:00,Huntley Cronje,At least Cyril has started down the right path - even if it might mean he could be implicated
1551366279897970,2:15:05,Wildthing,ANC pockets too full time to go
