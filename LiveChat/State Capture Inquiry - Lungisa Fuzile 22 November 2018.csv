1542876149514610,38:28,Sne Mdletye,it is personal if it affects ones career... screw comradeship
1542876183525865,39:02,Sam Vanguard,"@Quinton Van Den Bergh Hy beskuldig ANC van korrupsie, maar hy is korrup. Hy vergeet wat hy gedoen het in Limpopo. Ons sal sy fuckery ontbloot."
1542876200304858,39:19,Simphiwe Dube,@lee royal he (Adv Maleka) is south African anyway
1542876221923710,39:41,peter pott,"@1000, ,and sad they do. when an unlearned boy from nkandla deed his subtle campaign to presidency, they were sleeping. boom!!! he becomes president and realize his their boss. â˜ºâ˜º"
1542876224711821,39:44,lee royal,@Michael Mpagi @Simphiwe Dube guys apologies i was just asking
1542876291563700,40:50,Quinton Van Den Bergh,@Sam Vanguard Ek het gister met Heinrich gepraat dat hy sÃª sy ouens is op die proef as hulle probeer om na die land se eksppropiasieprobleem te slaan
1542876336951851,41:35,Michael Myers,lee royal we should never attack our own people for the white man to benefit
1542876367266897,42:06,holylady1000,"peter your tone is very condescending, i do not like it."
1542876386556406,42:25,peter pott,"have you noticed no one so far, came and said: chair this has caused us to be behind on building 5,6 or 10 schools, or clinics. instead they are fighting over nuclear, coal or trains. No one!!"
1542876469711734,43:49,lee royal,@Thando Nkutha i was just thinking what do the Zimbabweans have to do with South African matters thats all
1542876541715461,45:00,peter pott,"@1000. it's not. they must admit, that we the people entrusted them to guard the gate by our votes. but none of them did that. they are here playing victims. they are ANC cadres. why not recall pres?"
1542876549798186,45:09,Quinton Van Den Bergh,@Sam Vanguard do you think this inquiry will bear anything other than more looting by ANC
1542876604194401,46:03,Sam Vanguard,@Quinton Van Den Bergh naaa boet ANC is rotten this is a cover up by the ramaphosa faction to cover they're own tracks
1542876633794525,46:32,Sthakathi Khumalo,State Capture has been a CCMA rebellion of disgruntled employees!!
1542876639949246,46:39,Michael Myers,lee royal why do indians and whites who are less then 15 percent run the country
1542876657858356,46:56,holylady1000,"so as he reshuffles this evening, he must remember to mention his name, is that what you are suggeting peter? hahahahahahahahaha"
1542876675700371,47:14,holylady1000,all should step down!
1542876686392115,47:25,Nelson Musoliwa,Fuzile was trying to be professional and attempting to allays the nation and international fears about nene dismissal but gupta minister has non of this
1542876714203675,47:52,peter pott,"all we have been listening to do far, is ANC internal politics. those who list polokwane and mangaung, this is their turn to blame the outst leadership."
1542876730545586,48:09,Quinton Van Den Bergh,@Sam Vanguard waar ANC will never arrest itself from looting S.A infact the ramaphosa faction is happy to blind the average south african
1542876764897524,48:44,Mhlanguli Dlodlo,@Sthakathi Khumalo CCMA hearing lol. I'm getting the same sense. I particularly remember feeling the same way about Ms Phumla Williams' testimony
1542876772266123,48:51,lee royal,@Michael Mpagi dont worry we getting the land back soon...
1542876773972211,48:53,Simphiwe Dube,"Adv Maleka is the best evidence leader, Pretorius let PG off the hook in most cases"
1542876801392170,49:20,Mkhuseli Freddie,@peter pott I agree with you. We are caught in ANC factional battles and the commission is used as a mechanism to fight opponents
1542876808203336,49:27,peter pott,"@musoliwa, he was saving his job. hence he can now say, they are no longer my bosses. they think nothing of the poor"
1542876814867329,49:34,Sam Vanguard,@Quinton Van Den Bergh my only fear is EFF rhetoric lately it has been divisive in it's agendas
1542876819202601,49:38,Sophia Maholela,"Simphiwe, Adv Maleka is the best shame, I agree with you"
1542876835224038,49:54,lee royal,@Thando Nkutha i was just asking thats all...making sure nothing wrong with asking
1542876842623894,50:01,holylady1000,"it's always about the ANC, it has never been about us"
1542876851683455,50:10,Sthakathi Khumalo,"em D Exactly bro, its just a waste of our time now. I just feel for Zondos credibility here because he really has nothing to work on"
1542876861869693,50:21,holylady1000,we vote because we feel bad for the ANC
1542876862757684,50:22,Michael Myers,hope so to lee
1542876875083889,50:34,Quinton Van Den Bergh,@Sam Vanguard EFF should never taste power 2019 they will turn S.A into zimbabwe remember zimbabwe in 2002?
1542876886361589,50:45,holylady1000,We listen to news because we want to know if the ANC HAS STOPPED BEING CORRUPT OR NOT
1542876925218835,51:24,holylady1000,everything in SA revolves around ANC
1542876946908941,51:45,Michael Myers,Zimbabwe is fine. white people just dont want to lose their wealth
1542876965145947,52:04,Sam Vanguard,@Quinton Van Den Bergh yaaa you can say that many times EFF and its's big brother ANC should be out by 2019 we no longer need such threats to our democracy

1542877033457965,53:12,peter pott,"@van see bergh, that said, but EFF sees a vacuum here and like in many politics, they use it to the full. because they now if anc wins, it's gonna be further uphill. hence revelations of anc cadres"

1542877266930330,57:05,Sydwell Phakula,SA should learn to take hash decision & arrest all the corrupt people

1542877384858519,59:04,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Louis Eloff My fellow citizens, a Commission is not a court of law... it''s ""raison d' etre"" is for us, to hear what happened, and thereafter, make recommendations! Its suffice to say, lets wait"
1542877387478736,59:06,Marvel Ramatshela,Zuma wouldn't mess up if he didn't have support from ANC
1542877389670612,59:08,Speckled Trim,"Parliament lied during votes of no confidence, otherwise why are we in this position today?"

1542877435848412,59:55,Sam Vanguard,@Quinton Van Den Bergh yaa i can relate also to that we thought ANC under Mandela would be willing to protect our private property but now we see they wanna destroy it
1542877440272934,59:59,Speckled Trim,like the PP's recommendations that were thought to be non-binding while more billions were stolen. there's probably more new capture taking place right now
1542877456233597,1:00:15,Sydwell Phakula,All Parliamentarians are pathetic lairs

1542877562425330,1:02:01,peter pott,"there is the problem. one person is given authority. pride, and easily bribery can ensue. only one person to convince. government must change this. 5, or more people must share responsibility"
1542877568191953,1:02:06,Mkhululi Bushula,@Sam Vanguard black ppl did not own property under the apartheid regime.

1542880727819258,1:51:12,Sam Vanguard,@Quinton Van Den Bergh FF+ and DA better alternatives!! if National PARTY was still there that would have been better than the rst
1542880763499351,1:51:47,Fick Liebenberg,But CR is doing great work right now. I might even vote ANC if they start prosecuting the VBS looters and the Corrupt leaders..

1542883624546655,2:03:36,Dimakatso Nwandula,"@ThatoM it's uncommon not irregular, but what I've noticed is that when a black person is not corrupt he is then portrayed as corrupt like in the case of the Eff vs Pravin Or Eff Vs Cyril"
1542883697425691,2:03:58,Sthakathi Khumalo,I was listening to Jackson Mthembu trying to spin rubbish.. Cyril Must account admit he lied and face parliamentary might! Khusela Diko has tried spinning but Cyril must account for lying
