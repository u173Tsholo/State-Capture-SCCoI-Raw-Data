1566893797112924,13:08,Zama Kubheka,@carnoth ngomane I thought i was the only one
1566893830168647,13:42,123davyb,everything about Gavin Watson death is odd. I might even doubt that it is his body. If any body.
1566893886212873,14:37,carnoth ngomane,@Zama Kubheka you not
1566893897724958,14:49,Zama Kubheka,Even when they showed his brother on the news...he was all smiles
1566893921936476,15:13,Thulani Bukani,am I a bad person for not feeling any condolence for Watson and his family?
1566893936837389,15:27,123davyb,that was also odd for me
1566893973496402,16:04,siphelo ngunze,i think South African government is playing with money to promote this commission because nothing will come out of this particular procedure
1566893974110620,16:04,123davyb,not bad but unsimpathetic
1566893994520240,16:25,Graham Engelbrecht,GARAHM

1566894225009045,20:16,Cerebis,"@Pastor J I agree, but in many cases like this one of Watson, I will rather say nothing. My thoughts are rather with the families of the 20 600 people that will be murdered in South Africa every year."

1566894825841149,30:16,Robert Russell,Watson is answering for his crimes where ever he is.... he was found with R70... no luggage... no cell phone.. and the seat belt behind his back.... suicide seems possible

1566895274981636,37:46,Kevin Simon,Mandla Msimanga So YOU HAVE PROOF?!!!
1566895278603120,37:49,Pastor J.J,@Robert Russell Thats sad my brother. But the reality is what it is. A land of so many thieves with no respect for the dead and the dying
1566895298033292,38:09,Zaahier Adonis,Watson is instructed to take his own life or.........
1566895351712839,39:02,Lorraine Naidoo,To fist story .They did not want to open the door for the media but opened the door for the ANC members
1566895365007122,39:15,Lorraine Naidoo,fishy

1566895408781666,40:00,Sinethemba Mzimane,@Zaahier....something tells me uba the guy was instructed.
1566895432427015,40:23,makhosi nobhatyi,Correspondence first @ Abe Molefe
1566895432878461,40:23,Eugene,Watson ran away or he was murdered. It wasn't a accident nor was it suicide.
1566895440425775,40:31,Zaahier Adonis,Yes dear
1566895461611231,40:53,JERRY MALAHLELA,"So u think uhave seen it all in the movies, now is happening live."
1566895472425094,41:03,MmeBosso,"I have a feeling that there was another vehicle invovled, that maybe forced him off the road. Can they rule that out? Cause seriously, what is the speed limit on that road?"
1566895491818652,41:23,Kevin Simon,Mandla Msimanga ‚Äã maybe. The best way is to lodge a complain with the Public Protecter and i know a lot will be revealed.. Are you going to do this?
1566895508344273,41:39,Lorraine Naidoo,I agree that car was to damaged for that accident
1566895513234591,41:44,MmeBosso,@JERRY MALAHLELA like for real. There are no cameras but here we are today
1566895550918662,42:21,Eugene,Watson was driving cars for more than 50 years but just yesterday he forgot how to drive a car.
1566895577753094,42:48,Lorraine Naidoo,he only drove automatic
1566895610995258,43:22,MmeBosso,They are no cameras where the accident happened. toooooo convenient. This is beyond an inside job.
1566895633095969,43:44,JERRY MALAHLELA,cameras are there but controlled
1566895638865831,43:50,Robert Russell,The TAX man in the USA got gangster Al Capone into jail.... I think that SARS would also have enough evidence to have Watson incarcerated for TAX fraud...
1566895649092259,44:00,Zaahier Adonis,A rich man drive a car like that ha ha ha
1566895654042427,44:05,Abe Molefe,lamborgin to toyoya corolla a millionare? never
1566895658503315,44:10,MmeBosso,That's how I feel like this is a movie with a script.
1566895660729095,44:12,Sinethemba Mzimane,"With Collins,a truck driver was implicated & how far did the case go.this time around Homocide no passengers just the driver nd it happens to be Mr Watson the main man in the state capture"
1566895687188999,44:38,Eugene,The car was already damaged the day before. They then went and dropped the car off and scattered car parts all over.
1566895716236091,45:07,Makwa Choma,The issue of Watson is very clear like all the ANC killings happening in Kwazulu natal n Limpopo
1566895739039137,45:30,Kabelo Katjedi,"They claim that his car went for a service,does porch gives u a Toyota corolla while busy fixing u car"
1566895750925450,45:42,MmeBosso,@Eugene Fourie I wouldn't be surprised hey.
1566895776379295,46:07,Michael Michael,Who killed him.?
1566895779680865,46:10,Makwa Choma,The ANC KNOWS SOMETHING
1566895819698019,46:51,Kabelo Katjedi,This morning they allegedly made a statement saying they request investigation 2 be made by their private investigator not police
1566895835818103,47:07,Makwa Choma,michael hm
1566895848886722,47:19,JERRY MALAHLELA,ANC for u.

1566895855626614,47:26,Michael Michael,Makes agree
1566895857755733,47:28,MmeBosso,"@Mandla Msimanga I feel it is possible that he staged his death, with the help of others. Maybe 5 years from now he will pop up on some beach in the Maldives lol"
1566895860787392,47:32,Salmaan Abrahams,yesterday adv thembeka tweeted he is off to Bali
1566895871008067,47:42,Bongi Mkhwanazi,passing of human being even if its your enemy its not easily digestible lm very hurt what ever is behind hi some of the evidence is now null and avoid
1566895895783511,48:07,Salmaan Abrahams,i thnk within the tweet ( though) jokingly there is a truth
1566895901960029,48:13,Robert Russell,The ANC might have to pay back R40m of donations that they received from BOSASA since 2007 and if that is the case then that's the end of the corrupt ANC
1566895911241862,48:22,Eugene,The private investigators are only making sure that all other evidence is destroyed.
1566895918305525,48:29,Zaahier Adonis,Watson knows to much and theirs no money to give to people hes time is up so get rid of him....looking for a new player
1566895932456199,48:43,Max Muskat,DO we really need a holms to find out what happened to watson?
1566895951789091,49:03,Michael Michael,Robert do u think they have that money??
1566895957904203,49:08,Nelson Musoliwa,Thinking how Watson contributed to the struggle against apartheid; it is painful
1566895960888833,49:12,Kabelo Katjedi,"Mandla AGRZZI yesterday also said Watson ws planning to leave this country,they just appoint a black guy 2 be family spokesperson nt his rich friends"
1566895973881705,49:24,SONGEZO MNCOKO,lol we are really led by thugs here
1566895992939956,49:44,SNENHLANHLA VILAKAZI,old thugs

1566896071403406,51:03,Lorna Kavanagh,Watson death very strange... the driver hit a left hand side pillar on the right hand side ???? No damage to left hand side of vehicle.
1566896072984350,51:04,MmeBosso,@Zaahier Adonis True story!!
1566896089149168,51:20,Sinethemba Mzimane,Zaahier he dd get death treats already bt i dnt knw how he is surviving
1566896105754359,51:36,Nelson Musoliwa,Many people are finding it difficult to accept the version of Watson accidental death; reasonably so
1566896130727724,52:02,Robert Russell,Nope they are already on the brink of bankruptcy.... they can't even pay for their website management.... the ANC needs to have ACE come up with a plan to loot more for their coffers @Michael Michael
1566896138371285,52:09,Salmaan Abrahams,the only media house to report is eNCA
1566896140156959,52:10,SNENHLANHLA VILAKAZI,we didn't even see blood at the scene
1566896141078239,52:12,Lorna Kavanagh,Did anyone see accident right after it happened.
1566896149703882,52:21,Pedro P.,who is investigating the accident?
1566896228085997,53:39,Zaahier Adonis,what about the drones üò•üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1566896235879740,53:46,Kabelo Katjedi,"Thats why i ws saying this Commission is a joke,all implicated will leave this country,1 by 1. Rumors of Zuma having a house in india simply means he will take the same route"
1566896236702227,53:47,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,Michael Jackson attended his own funeral from the gallery
1566896244442982,53:55,Anne M.,One of the JMPD officers had blood on his gloves

1566896393328326,56:24,Pastor J.J,eNCA confirmed footage and the body being that of Mr Watson but will not broadcast it out of respect.
1566896404648687,56:35,Makwa Choma,HOW CAN CRIMINALS put up commision to investigate them n arrest them
1566896417817896,56:49,Dan Bourne Yeshurun,he has no reason to. even Agrizzi agrizzied to be the fall guy
1566896424098737,56:55,Sinethemba Mzimane,its very strange.normarly after an accident the medea wud show a body coverd this time its just a car nd th wud be witness tlng how th car lost control

1566896545417925,58:56,Mbombi,even at Marikana it was wrong for the media to show dead bodies like that
1566896563340769,59:13,Cerebis,The Watson accident reminds me a lot of the Diana accident....????
1566896582038438,59:32,Pastor J.J,Sadly when someone dies the negative comments can never hurt or insult the dead but those comments cause immense pain and suffering to the living relatives.
1566896586569600,59:37,Kabelo Katjedi,Thami exactly
1566896599814928,59:50,MmeBosso,This is deep. and unfortunately the beginning.
