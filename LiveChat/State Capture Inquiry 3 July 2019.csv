1562144512868183,46:09,Jabu Malinga,"when they told him billions, he did not no wat it was"
1562144529697587,46:26,Jabu Malinga,so they stole billons to Dubai and left him and his son with a few million
1562144584330657,47:21,makhosi nobhatyi,Ben Martin lied to us
1562144597059574,47:34,Jabu Malinga,"guptas are still flyin high around d world, but dudzane and co are left with a few rands now. ubaba zuma should hav taken the billions and gav guptas only millions"

1562144650767985,48:27,Carvin Motsumi,Ben Martin lied to the commission
1562144668704524,48:44,Norman Zwane,@Khaya Nomoyi They would not dare in case the whole thing points at JG Zuma. JGZ was untouchable within a corrupt ANC. He still is & is bringing the movement down with him like the biblical SAMSON
1562144677962511,48:55,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"It makes me question such people's cognitive ability to extrapolate , extract various meanings from a phrase prior to presumptuous response to it.."

1562144691024947,49:07,Nelson Musoliwa,This evidence is defying logic by far; Martins was told by gupta that they are Zuma guests so the no 1 reference is not far fetched
1562144696749245,49:13,makhosi nobhatyi,@Jabu malinga Zuma and his son have billions at Dubai kept by Guptas they even move their money to iran

1562144766722248,50:23,Jabu Malinga,shabir was conficted of bribing zuma yet zuma was not convicted of takin brides!!! hehehehe (zuma laugh) does that make sense??
1562144809779123,51:06,Jabu Malinga,guptas wil keep nothing. they used d zumas and left them with wat they hav. ter is no new money for them now
1562144864822277,52:02,makhosi nobhatyi,@Funicanz I was expecting concrete evidence to him when he says Atul those visitors are friends of Zuma but decided to hide information so he clean himself to be Guptas puppets

1562145067940687,55:25,Norman Zwane,@Jabu Malinga The favours keep the DON in power and the need for favours supplies the DON with protectors who will lay their lives to be the next recipients of the DON's favours. That is the ANC!

1562145317410559,59:33,Derek Main,@Pastor JJ It seems the intention was always to share out the spoils (however those came about) amongst the top cadres.

1562145544396587,1:03:21,Magda Seguin,They will be 'woolly' as there were 4 Indian Cabinet ministers on that Jet Airways plane
1562145569633803,1:03:46,Vukani Mngomezulu,"President J G Zuma did nothing, think it clear now to world,it only people that served under His leadership that been Robbers in support Aircraft landing."

1562145700742652,1:05:57,Derek Main,"@Vukani Mngomezulu That begs the question of why officials would quake in their boots when the Guptas told them : ""This is what #1 wants"". They must have known that the Guptas were tight with Zuma."
1562145703839914,1:06:00,Khaya Nomoyi,@Norman Zwane Its strange how this investigation was handle in a very weak approach by the investigators themselves.The first thing the Guptas mentioned the name of Zuma in their request.
1562145842433292,1:08:19,clive oconnell,Zuma cracked the whips and spread the üí∞üí∞üí∏

1562145958385840,1:10:15,Trinity Masiya,lol they all trying to protect him
1562145961608106,1:10:17,Norman Zwane,"@Khaya Nomoyi Until the DA and others climbed on the bandwagon, that is also how the INKANDLA looting was 'investigated' and fund JG Zuma blame free. In Thabo's time the ARMs thingy. It in the ANC DNA"
1562146001013609,1:10:57,Khaya Nomoyi,I wish they call Col Henderson after this because Koloane was not lying.He had to take the fall and got promotion for that.
1562146001374504,1:10:57,Trinity Masiya,he did ask them. remember the evidence of Ramatlodi?
1562146060125828,1:11:56,Nelson Musoliwa,What coerced Kolwane and Anderson to facilitate this landing taking into account the fact that Guptas said they are Zuma's guests.
1562146061851575,1:11:58,Sindiswa Moolman,Hope Koloane will come
1562146065431110,1:12:02,clive oconnell,Can we have 13 different languages as sub titles üòé
1562146066038462,1:12:03,MACK NYATI,I feel that this Witness is STILL blaming Koloana and Anderson...
1562146086224042,1:12:23,Magda Seguin,So why did Mkwebeni put the Waterkloof report in file 13?
1562146148684756,1:13:25,Magda Seguin,"Thuli said she left it to be completed and reported by the current PP but she never did,just shows that she is in the Zuma faction"
1562146192626705,1:14:09,Magda Seguin,They made Khoalani and Anderson the fall guys
1562146200961249,1:14:17,Sindiswa Moolman,Hope so @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. She‚Äôs my former DG.
1562146202061721,1:14:18,Khaya Nomoyi,Koloane and Anderson could not have taken the risk of allowing the landing of this plane unless there were instructions from above.
1562146210423090,1:14:27,Magda Seguin,Anderson took them to court
1562146225670747,1:14:42,Ibo Thabo,"@Thando Nkutha we won‚Äôt fight on my logic; you as human 1st belong to yourself, then to your family, then your neighbour & then to your village. You have to exchange life with those for survival"
1562146267918456,1:15:24,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Magda Seguin I cannot trust that Mkhwebane whatsoever. Have you managed to watch how dodgy she was on any Zupta related question during her interview for this PP post?
1562146295828690,1:15:52,Nelson Musoliwa,Must we believe that Kolwane can violet protocol without Zuma backing; absurd; Kolwane can not do it alone
1562146296817219,1:15:53,Magda Seguin,They eventually both left Khoalane to become ambassador and Anderson resigned but litugated against her being blamed
1562146300282362,1:15:57,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Sindiswa Moolman Oh wow.... is she one of the top officials we can trust? LOL
1562146350042644,1:16:46,Sindiswa Moolman,I can confidently say so @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU
1562146351847241,1:16:48,Magda Seguin,@Keith she appears to be partisan to the EFF and Zuma

1562146437812694,1:18:14,Nelson Musoliwa,In fact the whole govt of Zuma was invited to this wedding so obviously it knew all about this landing as gupta already indicated that they are Zuma guests
1562146449096864,1:18:26,Abe Molefe,who is next
1562146461802482,1:18:38,Magda Seguin,Yesterdays witness gave the most interesting testimony on aviation protocol...there was clearly instructions from very high up judging from what he said
1562146529516765,1:19:46,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Magda Seguin Spot on! Zuma faction and EFF that endorsed and motivated or persuaded the Chair (Makhosi Khoza) and other ANC Adhoc interview panel MPs that shes was a right candidate for the job.

1562146599704299,1:20:56,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Magda Seguin She was so dodgy and vague on any Zuma/Gupta related question during or when she was interviewed for this post. And Makhosi Khoza was not really convinced....like DA.

1562146788983677,1:24:05,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Magda Seguin She closed it cause Zuptas were going to be the one in trouble... obviously.

1562152463667076,2:58:29,roberto wilco,Maybe he has an interpreter
1562152469834355,2:58:34,Clive White,As English isnthe langauge used worldwide in aviation.
1562152470092016,2:58:34,carnoth ngomane,@Derek Main theres no need to bite your tongue while you have a language you are comfortable on
1562152474255597,2:58:39,Magda Seguin,@Ben Cole for a person with such a high rank he should be fluent in Englush especially working on an international platform
