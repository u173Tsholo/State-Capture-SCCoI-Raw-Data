1602668415988037,1:40:21,SanFran Arnold,@Valencia J always a pleasure
1602668463023475,1:41:08,TheQueen V,@Val I think that's a bit much unless they get their own private protection and pay for it. In cape flats theirs no private protection for the innocent who dies everyday
1602668473835256,1:41:18,Naledi Barron,"@Val Speirs Back in the day, the farmers did organise themselves if my memory serves me correctly."
1602668485259452,1:41:31,Val Speirs,We will take out the killers before they can do anything. land was purchased and not free if you want land then pay for it.
1602668495204804,1:41:41,TheQueen V,hey @zip did you just wake up now? üòÇüòÇ
1602668543561645,1:42:30,Bongumenzi Nxumalo,"For a second, I thought Tokyo Sexwale was testifyingüòëüòë"
1602668558990453,1:42:44,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Lee D. Hendrix I think our young democracy has all the tools but increasingly lack the peoples champions to understand and advocate for the issues and use these Tools.
1602668564366583,1:42:50,Val Speirs,Afriforum and the farming community will ask overseas sponsors for assistance.
1602668569280934,1:42:55,Naledi Barron,@Eddie Reddy Agree. But I feel that the JZ-Gupta cabal did try to compromise him!
1602668579838745,1:43:06,TheQueen V,"@Val protect yourself however you see fit, just remember consequences is different for every race in this country. Don't incite crazyness, come up with solutions."
1602668594049928,1:43:18,Blake Yogi,She laughed. oh woe
1602668621542205,1:43:46,Val Speirs,The solution is to be forearmed and forewarned.
1602668645230248,1:44:11,Diketso Moyo,Imagine she laughed.........
1602668654707661,1:44:19,SanFran Arnold,@Val Speirs it is indeed outrageous what is happening to our farmers. Considering the fact that they are our key to food security. But we should be wary to incite violence.
1602668656529363,1:44:21,TheQueen V,looks like the lovechild of bheki Cele and Tokyo
1602668701159466,1:45:06,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Val Speirs Afriforum is a inevitable player. Just one of many sides of a coin. Like most players nuance and truth suffers when we want simple answers.
1602668722542524,1:45:27,Val Speirs,"The criminal are inciting violence, we simply cannot sit back and tolerate this racism."
1602668728150666,1:45:34,Blake Yogi,Guys who can spell out that legal term?
1602668739030185,1:45:44,TheQueen V,"agreed @Sanfran. I am also appalled and deeply saddened by this senseless killings, it's horrible. However if all of us retaliate in the same way we will have war."
1602668766667235,1:46:12,joyce tendai Zvavareyi,I feel for this gentleman. He also appears to be a very honest and upright. I salute such people of this stature.
1602668787167301,1:46:33,Naledi Barron,"@MASEGO mpitsang SO true! In-fighting, nepotism, back-stabbing, all resulting in NO forward momentum. I witnessed this personally!"
1602668791999584,1:46:37,Roy Kisten,that's what I am saying

1602668818729771,1:47:04,Nathi Gumada,"@val, land was purchased from who?"
1602668822504592,1:47:07,Aubrey De Bliquy,@SanFran Arnold This is why I refer to nuance as so vital. I was robbed on a farm while my two young children lay asleep. It was simply crime. My race and that of the criminals was irrelevant
1602668822627420,1:47:07,TheQueen V,"@Val absolutely don't sit back. Retaliate different to your oppenents. There must be other ways. I agree that enough is truly enough,"
1602668826399990,1:47:12,Blake Yogi,"Ask your ask, Chair"
1602668872507946,1:47:57,Jabu Malinga,eff wer jumping with clicks. i didnt see them jumpin when ppl r burning roads n cars..i dont see eff when thugs r burning universities
1602668893198944,1:48:19,SanFran Arnold,"@Aubrey De Bliquy I am with you it should not be seen through the eyes of race but through the eyes of crime, but we know how our government deals with that or doesn't as is the case"
1602668896565183,1:48:22,MASEGO mpitsang,"@Naledi Barron i am also talkimg from personal experience. traumatic, i could write a book"
1602668897973793,1:48:24,Aubrey De Bliquy,The same as the divisive issue of WMC. Monopoly Capital is an inherent potential problem as it is amoral by definition. Nuance is everything.
1602668908121316,1:48:33,Naledi Barron,"@Jabu Malinga Yes, you're quite right!"

1602669319872680,1:55:25,Jabu Malinga,This government has no sense of what service delivery is. they only no stealing

1602669418941353,1:57:04,Aubrey De Bliquy,@wim louw South Africa has the most proud legal tradition among the nations of the world. Even under Partheid the law was a limit on the excesses of Apartheid.
