1551789500474388,36:57,Danie Nilsen,"@Bridgette Kekana agreed, but it takes 2 to tango"
1551789508688422,37:06,Lucky123 Thwala,this bustered.
1551789514301500,37:11,bones0605,"NO ruling party anywhere in the world, doing this to their own economy, has the RIGHT to existence, less have the audacity to stand in elections. POINT."

1551789628897164,39:06,A R,share the power give the DA then EFF next
1551789641009030,39:18,welton paulse,"I would want the government to be criminally charged as well, for exposing us to such corruption"
1551789662563331,39:40,Danie Nilsen,"this is what they call fix the fukup and lie lie and lie never admit to anything unless the ""price is right"""
1551789673982585,39:51,carnoth ngomane,"The ANC will win the next election whether we like it or not, Voting for DA its like going back to Apartheid, again DA do nothing that focusing on ANC'S mistakes and that takes them out of the picture"
1551789690520889,40:07,Sofia Sofia,He will talk till his nonsense with his bald head and his pixie ears @Sthakathi Khumalo
1551789716980324,40:34,carnoth ngomane,with the right approach EFF could topple ANC
1551789778086084,41:35,Darryl Lavis,Apartheid existed because there was no democracy. That is all different now
1551789779843512,41:37,Bridgette Kekana,@ngomane l dont agree with u they hv realise their mistakes
1551789820505208,42:17,Danie Nilsen,"we must change to a goverment away from the colonial style, rather a federal state with automany from central goverment,also to vote for a named president and not a fatcat nec big 6 one"
1551789839243202,42:36,Joel Mzayidume,Maimane and his DA have nothing to offer the majority of South Africans. EFF will overtake them. ANC has been messing up for 25 years.
1551789886864510,43:24,carnoth ngomane,"@Bridgette Kekana i agree with you, Thats why we should give them a chance"
1551789921756156,43:59,Danie Nilsen,the eff have no aproach what so ever self enrichment aka shivambo an co so let us leave them in political dessert
1551790005427489,45:23,Wildthing,Joel since when is it that a party must offer anything. its peoples tax money that pays for things. people need to learn that. you get what you put in. EFF can't offer what they don't have.
1551790025166553,45:42,Joel Mzayidume,ANC will win based on inertia. The ignorant masses are still in the dark so they'll vote for what they've always voted for. Enlightened ones will take their votes elsewhere
1551790076907163,46:34,Ben Cole,@Darryl Lavis. Are we a democracy or socialist state? The power in the latter is centralised and benefits an elitist group at the expense of the majority.
1551790090043425,46:47,carnoth ngomane,The only reason that makes white hate Eff is because they are not scared to speak their minds and they speak for black people and they preach EQULITY in all spheres an that is a threat to wmc
1551790097760537,46:55,Danie Nilsen,time will be the healing aspect when us old timers and the jail (robben island ocupants) are gone and capasitated politicians are in gov it will happen
1551790120778541,47:18,Bridgette Kekana,Lets us give CR a chance n l think the wrong doers hate CR
1551790125883997,47:23,Wildthing,jobs need to be created. exports improved. unions rights reduced or removed. Government sets the rules and should apply them. and people need to know the truth.
1551790179504066,48:16,carnoth ngomane,@ Bridgette we will give him a chance and he will be president
1551790183218283,48:20,David David,Someone explain to me in law when person reach 55 to 60 years it's going to pension when all this toppies at AFRICAN NATIONAL CORRUPTION go there

1551790212775303,48:50,Magda Seguin,EFF is populist....they condone the disasters like Venezuela and Zimbabwe...they Will make SA a total failed state.The promises in their manifesto are fairy tales
1551790296014094,50:13,Joel Mzayidume,"@Magda Seguin the chairman of the ANC, Gwede Mantashe, is leading a delegation to Venezuela on a fact-finding mission"

1551790555040026,54:32,Ben Cole,@Magda Seguin. Venezuela is a failed socialist state. The governing party is sending a fact finding mission to Venezuela under leadership of its Secretary General. To find out what?
1551790619650306,55:37,Indoda Yamaqiniso,When did Venezuela became a failed state?
1551790638327232,55:55,Indoda Yamaqiniso,Media has made people very stupid #SMH
1551790700359754,56:57,Magda Seguin,"@Ben Cole I agree...Chavez nationalised everything hoping oil money will make a difference,he borrowed billions from the Russians and Chinese"
1551790710756856,57:08,Indoda Yamaqiniso,He's trying to send a certain perspective without having facts at hand.
1551790727999848,57:25,Magda Seguin,People who believe the EFF nationalisation plans should take heed
1551790838940227,59:16,Magda Seguin,Mantashe himself is caught up in state capture...it's a joke that he wants to take a 'fact finding' trip when the world knows the situation in Venezuela
