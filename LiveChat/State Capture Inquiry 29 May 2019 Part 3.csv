1559134916461594,1:02:25,Tich Ziny,@Granny Mokwena I agree with you. quite alarming and disheartening. All this dishonesty
1559134947683042,1:02:56,Felix Muyoba,even this hedging thing is it allowed?

1559136952085818,1:36:21,Joy Samuel,The ANC president has started on the round foot there for a vote of no confidence motion should be place against him
1559137176923551,1:40:06,watson mutanga,There have been calls by some to support the president of the country. My view is that he has to earn that support. What he does with the findings of this and other current commissions is key.
1559137237025067,1:41:06,watson mutanga,This is the last chance for South Africa to resurrect itself.
1559137377833657,1:43:26,Cerebis,"@watson mutanga I agree! The first test is if he has a credible cabinet. No 2 is if he facilitates the action to address all the findings of the State capture, PIC and other commissions."
1559137464680891,1:44:53,Cerebis,"If President CR does not positively act, it will be the same ANC snake with a different head."

1559139729952965,2:22:39,watson mutanga,@Thabang Aphane: Itâ€™s certain that the Rand will weaken over time. If you fix prices the seller will lose out in regards to future transactions. The transactions involved are long term.
1559139799464501,2:23:48,Lehurutse Mokhonwana,@Thabang Aphane It looks like the hedge was put in place but then Brian & Anoj out of their cleverness manipulated the figures.
