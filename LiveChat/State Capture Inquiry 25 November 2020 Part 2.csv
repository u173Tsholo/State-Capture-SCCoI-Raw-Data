1606307487406976,23:08,TheQueen V,they are censoring us so they can monitor our communication here. Why do we have to be slower and wait 31 seconds to send next message🙄 something sinister lurking. Can't keep up with the A-team 😂😂

1606308594681807,41:36,Dominic Przybylski,Chat is slowed to help us concentrate on the testimony instead of on comments of people who seem to treat this commission as a dating service.

1606308986858661,48:05,Pastor J.J,@Dominic Przybylski The Dating in the chat was being run as a side bus for a fee. Now that you have given it prominence you have denied @Valencia J and the A Team of our only source of income. hahaha

1606309112932576,50:14,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Rahab Takalo I doubt the court will not agree with Zondo. This is not even a grey area. It is clear Zuma did not even present a case for recusal.

1606309856579422,1:02:37,SanFran Arnold,The cANCer has bankrupted the country. They went straight for the business hub of SA and just went on a looting spree. How do they still get away with this?
1606309858089064,1:02:39,ALTA,@Sanfran Arnold can you see me
1606309871251253,1:02:54,Teunis van Ree,@Naledi Barron correct
1606309880567552,1:02:59,Yolo More,@Minnib Prince unless they sell Luthuli House.
1606309880820340,1:02:59,Aubrey De Bliquy,@bongile sango I know the DA is as expedient as all politicians with perhaps a little more style. I certainy do not trust their policies as adequate to our challenges.

1606310008298182,1:05:09,Aubrey De Bliquy,We have more than enough competent and qualified black people with the necessary integrity and moral fortitude but they are not welcome in the centers of power. Where is their political home?

1606310054138583,1:05:54,Pastor J.J,@Minnib Prince You could be right with Kakhuis Niehaus being in the same building
1606310054769421,1:05:54,Kopz Koape,in the state capture inquest zumas behaviour was predictable

1606310138852775,1:07:21,bongile sango,@Aubrey I can understand if he says it's better than the others. because as a person who is staying in CT. things are coming too slow to my place.

1606310206034399,1:08:28,Manelisi mnguni,DA has ran the Western Cape very well and ANC has ran the rest very corruptly.
1606310208062410,1:08:30,SanFran Arnold,"@Aubrey De Bliquy yes, as the commission intensifies, the evidence leaders are champions in their field"
1606310220339480,1:08:43,Naledi Barron,@3RDCREWTEK Your typing error of course!

1606310309516682,1:10:11,3RDCREWTEK AutoBlog,gugulethu and langa is a refelcrion of how DA sees lower class citizens in this country
1606310311355423,1:10:13,Naledi Barron,LOL @Aubrey De Bliquy !
1606310338527652,1:10:40,SanFran Arnold,@Cain Chunda they are getting there. The evidence leader said so in his opening remarks if you listened.
1606310362465691,1:11:03,Cain Chunda,ANC is the home of thugs
1606310363796680,1:11:04,ALTA,@Sal SA orange are now big fashion 😁😁
1606310364319124,1:11:05,Terrance H Parkin,most vote anc to get in on the criminal activities.
1606310419111912,1:11:59,Zweli Nkomo,how can we trust any led government by anc when members of its party seems to be so involved in dubious transactions between EOH and how the company looted the state
1606310427685640,1:12:07,Cain Chunda,getting where Arnold?
1606310431811812,1:12:13,Rahab Takalo,"this is the begining of a failed state or it has startef already, thanks to corruption"
1606310457690563,1:12:38,Aubrey De Bliquy,ANC is supposed to be te home of the Freedom Charter. We want our home back. and the land which is our birthright as South Africans.
1606310471962765,1:12:53,Heather Durr,They should do this for every company !!!!!!!!
1606310480151154,1:13:00,3RDCREWTEK AutoBlog,"yes Aubrey,fully agree"
1606310511238928,1:13:33,Kopz Koape,@Aubrey De Bliquy. What are you talking about???
1606310527117771,1:13:49,Nkosi Welcome,@Aubrey you want your apartheid back?
1606310563048809,1:14:23,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Kopz Koape Our constitution is supposed to be a fulfilment of the Freedom Charter. That ideal is still to be realized.
1606310565231932,1:14:28,Canis Africanis,"Yes Aubrey, and a job. And house. Electricity and water. And free WiFi."
1606310565323977,1:14:28,Kieron Sinewave,I wonder what the ratio is between actual corruption and just being bad at your job ... atm it seems most in this commission are both :{
1606310565785591,1:14:29,Karen x,Herman Mashabe is useless... he is just another politician... ex anc
1606310575727366,1:14:37,Tshepo Maseko,"Aubrey said ""All South Africans"""
1606310579353724,1:14:43,Sbusiso Christian,Let him explain Nkosi... Aubery... how do you mean exactly?
1606310608840818,1:15:11,Dominic Przybylski,@Aubrey De Bliquy Unfortunately ideals are often confused with illusions.
1606310610025307,1:15:13,ALTA,@Minnib Prince very relaxing this slow mode hey sis😁😁
1606310612912685,1:15:13,3RDCREWTEK AutoBlog,"Aubrey is right,we want the freedom charter back"
1606310616757148,1:15:17,SanFran Arnold,@Nkosi Welcome that is not what he was saying. You must read with understanding. He was saying we as South Africans
1606310620856093,1:15:22,sammy sammido,GTI 7 must go and arrest ANC
1606310653327144,1:15:56,Aubrey De Bliquy,Us mean all of us. I do not subscribe to te fantasy of group guilt or group pprosperity. We are one nation. We swim or sink together. United we stand. Divided we fall.
1606310672866460,1:16:14,Kopz Koape,@Aubrey de Bliquy. The freedom charter does have flaws such as SA is for all who live in it . Illegal immigrants take advantage of that.
1606310684714109,1:16:25,Rahab Takalo,"South Africa belongs to al those who live in it, but all these revelations proved opposite"
1606310694418678,1:16:34,Pastor J.J,I never cease to be amazed how people spend money on Data just to come on here and behave foolishly. Eish
1606310696325035,1:16:36,Mbulelo Zitha,I disagrees with the idea that the anc is the home criminals it's not
1606310715862818,1:16:56,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Kopz Koape Exactly. If we have no borders we have no country.
1606310776072598,1:17:57,Minnib Prince,@Alta.....yep
1606310781060949,1:18:03,Dominic Przybylski,Even the powerful Soviet Union wasn't able to convert the illusion of the same ideal into a reality. If they failed what makes you think a small underdeveloped country like ours will succeed?
1606310787459060,1:18:08,roza,chair we cant hear you
1606310788834201,1:18:10,Kieron Sinewave,@Heather Durr I had a look at this guys company website.. interesting stuff. did the commission hire them?
1606310794406791,1:18:16,MOLLY PHUNGULA,ANC IS ROTTEN TO THE CORE
1606310815153742,1:18:32,Thami Nkoana,South africa is the only country that is boderless

1606310840032531,1:18:59,Minnib Prince,@Alta. ..I am now even cutting up veggies as well. ....lol
1606310860668784,1:19:23,thando cezula,When is DCJ announcing a decision on Dudu Myeni?
1606310866631004,1:19:27,Pastor J.J,@Mbulelo Zitha May I ask. What has the ANC done for you and its people vs. what we hear they did for themselves?
1606310873259756,1:19:34,ALTA,@Minnib Prince😂😂😂
1606310880886297,1:19:39,Lee D. Hendrix,...The NPA could supply employment for the youth. The paper-trails of stolen money go back for years and centuries.
1606310909628365,1:20:10,Kopz Koape,Some foriegners can stay as long as they abide by law and do the right thing and contribute to economy by creating employment and investment
1606310925777390,1:20:28,Heather Durr,"@Kieron Sinewave You mean ENS-They were hired by EOH BUT we need a forensic audit on all SOE's that are raised here-it gives the answers , no argument"
1606310939349586,1:20:40,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Kopz Koape Yes. If 1000 pupils enter the borders there must be two extra schools for their pupils if they are not to be second class ciizens without the right to education we all have.
1606310941108470,1:20:41,Teunis van Ree,@thando cezula the matter is already on its way to the courts
1606310974756088,1:21:16,Rahab Takalo,glim and glamour at the expense of tax payers monies 🤔🤔
1606311003852057,1:21:44,Pastor J.J,R617.77 someone has been looking at my bank statement it seems
1606311007413380,1:21:49,SanFran Arnold,@Aubrey De Bliquy indeed. Infrastructure is needed for the influx of people. But we know that the cANCer cannot provide it
1606311038551027,1:22:18,ALTA,@Pastor J.J 😂😂
1606311059033265,1:22:40,Philly Moropa,hypocrisy is when anc tell us white companies are bad for us and then blackmailing the same companies into corruption in the name of protecting them from angry masses
1606311069673554,1:22:50,SanFran Arnold,DCJ well done on joining the dots there. Important.
1606311115688493,1:23:36,Kieron Sinewave,@Heather Durr riiiiight
1606311117017905,1:23:38,ALTA,@Sanfran Arnold i agree
1606311134398443,1:23:53,Makombe Aldrin,"What's going here, somebody say something?"
1606311191434484,1:24:53,bongile sango,This is the reason our beloved country is on it's knees
1606311246505629,1:25:48,Kopz Koape,@Aubrey De Bilquy..Im thinking perhaps the government should deploy soldiers to all the borders especially porous borders. Perhaps SANDF can establish barracks near borders and patrol borders
1606311268660283,1:26:09,Thami Nkoana,Yours in democracy:elbowcough::elbowcough:
1606311314263454,1:26:56,Rahab Takalo,ppl were thriving on corruption
1606311342140684,1:27:24,Antony Goedhals,It is so wonderful to see Arthur Chaskalson's son continuing his father's services to SA - by helping DCJ Zondo to see the extent of the cancer in this land. Stength to them all - and thanks.
1606311350092549,1:27:30,Teunis van Ree,@Kopz Koape that is what commandos used to do
1606311379154666,1:27:58,ALTA,@Ismail Petersen no just orange will do for corrupt people
1606311397939809,1:28:18,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Kopz Koape as long as there is no bribery to allow people to buy their way into the country ... but I guess that applies to all borders. THe immigration authorities need to be fixed.
1606311421543995,1:28:43,Dominic Przybylski,"""LAN and WAN"" gives as much detail as invoicing for ""IT"". There is no measurable deliverable."
1606311480145386,1:29:37,TheQueen V,Sekhakane should learn a thing or two
1606311510456969,1:30:12,Grant Herholdt,And people wonder why Joburg’s IT billing system is dysfunctional
1606311547290170,1:30:49,Kopz Koape,"@Aubrey De Bliquy..I agree, perhaps soldiers or police near bordes can wear body cams, government should allocate money to body cams to fight corruption"
1606311569661103,1:31:11,Naledi Barron,"@Grant Herholdt It's a historical issue, starting with the shambolic implementation of SAP ..."
1606311603141477,1:31:43,Dominic Przybylski,@Kopz Koape We need body cams on our politicians more urgently.
1606311605656488,1:31:45,Antony Goedhals,@Kopz Koape that is a brilliant idea - they should do this with our cops and also with our civil servants.
1606311622888073,1:32:04,Grant Herholdt,And since then neither SAP or EOH can fix it despite getting paid bajillions for doing just that.
1606311655132422,1:32:33,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Kopz Koape Wise leadership is so vital.
1606311691323106,1:33:14,Naledi Barron,@Grant Herholdt Exactly!! And therin lay the opportunities for such graft and c orruption to have taken place over the last 15+ years!
1606311691820646,1:33:14,Kopz Koape,"@Antony and@ dominic. Yes, however i dont think this useless government will.."
1606311755793713,1:34:18,roza,this lahers name seems to be cropping up all tge time
1606311791278185,1:34:52,Kopz Koape,"@Aubrey. I dont think ill see wise leadeship in this lifetime, as im an old man"
1606311795925159,1:34:58,Dominic Przybylski,@Kopz Koape Lol. No government anywhere would support political transparency. That's why it's so important to get Frog Boiler to sign the political party donation legislation into law.
1606311832129750,1:35:33,Yolo More,Makhubo must go straight to jail.

1606312010281756,1:38:30,Sekoka Louis Mmako,this is scary

1606312134119804,1:40:36,Arctic,the anc is well insulated from prosecution they had 10 years to prepare for this moment so I dont think much is going to come from this only minions will go to jail

1606312174747682,1:41:15,Heather Durr,@Karen x Thanks-I just cannot get my mind around how much they paid for nothing-its mindblowing
1606312208426883,1:41:48,Dominic Przybylski,@Kopz Koape I don't see when or how it can return to anything like success considering all circumstances. Our only hope is that the private sector will be able to keep the economy running.
1606312223006801,1:42:04,ALTA,well im just flabbergasted
1606312232696967,1:42:14,Fred Desrosiers,"@Tongai Mupedzi, no. But some were stealing, others closed their eyes. Meanwhile South Africans suffer."

1606312480910860,1:46:22,Dominic Przybylski,@Phakamile Khuzwayo The primary responsibilty of a government is to maintain law and order. Our government is a criminal syndicate. We don't have a real government. We have to survive without one.

1606312782238829,1:51:23,Heather Durr,@Minnib Prince 🙂
1606312783446625,1:51:25,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Kauju Mwakajumba That makes sense.
1606312798113609,1:51:39,Dominic Przybylski,@Phakamile Khuzwayo We have to rely on ourselves as individuals rather than be herded (as the masses) like cows towards an abbatoir.

1606314247273158,2:15:47,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Kauju Mwakajumba ot a pastor. That was a fancy dress on my facebook page. LOL lots of eople ask that. But I am profoundly spiritual. I don't like religious fundamentalism detached from reality.
1606314298590740,2:16:38,Pastor J.J,@Sal SA Totally agree. She read from the Trump script. Nothing special really
1606314313549051,2:16:54,Kopz Koape,@Valencia.. Where are you my dear???
1606314378668068,2:17:58,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Phakamile Khuzwayo 100% the race thing is like all group guilt and division the oldest tool of scoundrels and tyrants designed to make us all weak and dependent. We unite and watch devils tremble.
1606314376556861,2:17:58,Sal SA,"@Heather Durr. Disappointed with Republicans, spineless senators who allowed Trump destroy unity in the party."

1606314670865340,2:22:53,Sal SA,"@Heather Durr. Trump will be influential in the party, like Zuma."
1606314693476289,2:23:14,Kopz Koape,@Aubrey wait a minute are you suggesting that there was voter fraud???.

1606315183496308,2:31:23,Aubrey De Bliquy,"No, I watched USA elections for many years . Their voting system is riddled with mechanisms to manipulate the result and there is no transparency and unbridled corruption with judicial complicity."
1606315209103266,2:31:49,Pastor J.J,@Anne M. Same one

1606315275572933,2:32:57,Anne M.,"Don't know about a phone, but if you're on a laptop or PC you can pop out the chat and go to eNCA on another tab. @Thanda Sibisi"
1606315287419926,2:33:08,Aubrey De Bliquy,USA is more captured by the Military industrial congressional complex to levels of sophistication Zuma could only dream of. It is not just a failed state but a rogue state and a dangerous one.
1606315388686692,2:34:48,Aubrey De Bliquy,@Kopz Koape I fully endorse his attemot to expose the fraud no matter his success or failure even while I strongly oppose his politics. It is a principle. We are ruled by law or the jungle.
1606315440055885,2:35:41,SanFran Arnold,They needed 50 mil and were asking for contributions to help with the recon of their account
1606315528083126,2:37:08,SanFran Arnold,A concealed donation via Mfundi.......No ANC NOOOOOO
1606315581693285,2:38:03,Kopz Koape,@Aubrey..Anyway Trump can always relocate to china when he officially retires from politics
1606315666180419,2:39:29,Kopz Koape,@Aubrey .The reason i say that is i think Trump loves China and he is so obsessed with China .He may retire and settle there
1606315677138371,2:39:38,Minnib Prince,what's happening
1606315690969992,2:39:53,thembisa odendaal,@SalSA no one is beyond reproach perhaps we should all start there because if we don not acknowledge the inherent flaws of being human we end up here

1606316866060983,2:59:27,Anne M.,I've been racking my brain to think who Adv Chaskalson sounds like and now I have it - Stephen Grootes . Don't you think they have similar voices? @SanFran Arnold
1606316885885227,2:59:45,Aubrey De Bliquy,The epic nature of these revelations belies the calmness of their delivery.
1606316894872597,2:59:55,SanFran Arnold,@Anne M. you are correct. I do hear it
