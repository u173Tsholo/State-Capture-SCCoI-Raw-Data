1568967489115490,38:09,Rob Nel,"@Smart Guys I was born in RSA, how do you advise I ""return"" to Europe"
1568967526191815,38:46,Smart Guys,why u defending apartheid

1568967650485098,40:50,Rob Nel,"@Smart Guys , well so far, they have screwed up the power properly"
1568967690143388,41:30,nhlanhla nkosi,I though this is state of capture commission not apartheid commission nor xenophobia commission. can chat about that
1568967695172093,41:35,Robert Russell,It's going to be interesting to see how apartheid is used in 23 years time when SA has been living in a democratic society for as long as apartheid was applied to society
1568967786856892,43:07,Robert Russell,Oh yes I forgot about those dooses....
1568967836615799,43:57,Smart Guys,Amandla 😁😁😁😁😁
1568967840755989,44:01,Robert Russell,@Rob Nel ....exactly my point....
1568967868957806,44:29,Sindiswa Moolman,We have one Witness you has just died... Gavin Watson.
1568967880392264,44:40,Kevin Simon,I Am Free ​even tho there was no black people in south africa at that time.. well only in KZN And those in KZN were trying to colonize the rest of the country!!!
1568967895475093,44:56,Sindiswa Moolman,Just tuned in guys... did I miss something?
1568967987023526,46:27,Le Roux Strydom,"Please use this platform appropriately, its so obvious that some people use it for their personal blog with comments that is inappropriate and with no relevance at all to this matter"
1568968001392277,46:42,Danie Nilsen,"@Robert Russell that piece of info will not enter into 90 persent of eff minds as relevant issues are for the above 70 persnt IQ and not on the borderline of 30 persent,,,,"
1568968022640317,47:03,nhlanhla nkosi,Michael where are you some people needs to be blocked here coz this is about state capture nothingelse
1568968031995989,47:13,Nash Aniruth,Say No to Racism
1568968052906772,47:33,Robert Russell,Based on what I have read.... the EEF which is only Mal Enema.... will fail based on him being incarcerated for at least one one of the many charges/allegations against him
1568968062575424,47:43,Smart Guys,agree Nash
1568968118120766,48:38,Moshoeu Mabusela,"South Africans, let us pray for our country. our leaders and the police have lost their consciousness due to corruption. They speak in tongues, away from the truth, while the youth is suffering."
1568968206674456,50:07,Danie Nilsen,they are teaching the youth thier own corrupt ways and so the applecart just get more rotten
1568968256978556,50:57,Richard Nyila,The ANC government has failed its voters or its people in many ways. The fact that they rewarded the cadre deployment with no skills or prerequisite for certain departments hence this mess
1568968338111038,52:18,nhlanhla nkosi,u only chatting to 2k people about all that past and it won't make any difference about our future. but Wat Is happen here with this state capture thing will make a difference in our future
1568968437093995,53:57,Thapelo Motabogi,this is a serious matter
1568968673517713,57:54,Margareth Waterboer,I hope some people on here listen to the evidence and not just sexualise the enquiry because it’s a pretty woman.. it’s sickening...how some men view ladies...h
1568968723627357,58:44,Rob Nel,"It is meant as a compliment, towards a nice looking lady"
1568968760287875,59:21,adrian albertyn,agreed
1568968869263807,1:01:09,Derrick saperstein,"Before 1994, I heard many say, ""When the new government is here, I can do a lot of frauds, because the new people in power have no experience."" This has proved to be so!"
1568968935954456,1:02:16,rosalind gerber,@Derrick saperstein The ANC inherited an inherently corrupt system.
1568969002814856,1:03:23,rosalind gerber,and probably had a lot of favors to repay
1568969092539473,1:04:53,Derrick saperstein,"Rosalind, I don't dispute that, but the people did not suffer as they do now."
1568969103679202,1:05:04,Radha Krishna,The transcripts for the hearing impaired is hilarious if not crazy. General Allah..... for God's sake!!!
1568969112130579,1:05:12,Deon de Swardt,It is obvious that State Capture runs deep into the state departments ... Cadre deployment should STOP !!
1568969138956744,1:05:39,Moshoeu Mabusela,@rosalind gerber They also added their own corruption to burden the collapsed system
1568969146293526,1:05:47,rosalind gerber,so should the politicizing of key SOE positions
1568969155721427,1:05:56,Rob Nel,"@rosalind gerber , The ANC ""inherited, ESKOM, SABC SAL SASOL, PO, Government hospitals ( 1st Heart transplant done at a state hospital) that functioned and operated at a profit"
1568969191224355,1:06:31,rosalind gerber,The state was functioning in 1994 - it needed to be maintained
1568969209601584,1:06:51,Derrick saperstein,"Rob Nel, Very true."
1568969258044073,1:07:38,Robert Russell,SAL = SAA
1568969270337121,1:07:51,rosalind gerber,it would be great to be able to have national pride again
1568969272365951,1:07:53,Sindiswa Moolman,And the best in Africa @I Am Free
1568969272576041,1:07:53,Rob Nel,"@I Am Free , well now we 2nd most dangerous country in the world..Whoop whoop"
1568969369429337,1:09:30,rosalind gerber,Agreed @Rob Nel although the Nats were corrupt but managed to keep it to the top echelons and still hold the state in regard
1568969383022447,1:09:43,Robert Russell,Just like we offer big game hunting... we could also offer drive by shooting to our tourist offerings
1568969462225121,1:11:02,Rob Nel,"And free vehicles, sold by Hi Jack"
1568969523098054,1:12:03,Robert Russell,Or sold by our security services
1568969651970484,1:14:12,Derrick saperstein,"Maditla - 4 life sentences! The prison system will give proper punishment. In 1976, I spent 6 years behind bars for bank robbery. During that period, 3 child killers, were killed by fellow prisoners."
1568969733652444,1:15:34,clive oconnell,A SAPS snake with so many heads 🐍
1568969808541146,1:16:49,Rob Nel,"Nice hats, that seem too small for his head"
1568969870720797,1:17:51,Dan Brown,Witnesses do get bumped off. Look at Gavin Watson. You could hear the huge Collective sigh of relief from Government all over the country. The Only person that could finger Zuma and Senior Politicians
1568969904677439,1:18:25,Rob Nel,"I agree Dan, that guy was taken out"
1568969943490611,1:19:04,Nash Aniruth,South African Illuminati
1568969971051413,1:19:31,Thapelo Motabogi,"ANC HAS FAILED,THEY MUST BE DEGRADED BACK TO GRADE R,WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS FOOLISH"
1568969977163182,1:19:38,Robert Russell,Apparently he was dead before he hid the pillar
1568969991414083,1:19:52,Robert Russell,hit*
1568970050528513,1:20:51,Nash Aniruth,"Yes, definitely a hit courtesy of the zuma party"
1568970054437436,1:20:55,Rob Nel,"And his main artery was cut, but not enough blood in the car"
1568970082029987,1:21:22,Dan Brown,"Something Fishy, The Vehicle was moved 2 quickly, it would have sat there for hours if there if there is a death Involved. Even if his heart wasn't pumping there is almost no Blood on the Air Bag."
1568970100981279,1:21:41,Derrick saperstein,I would love to see a proper report on Watson's autopsy.
1568970143668868,1:22:24,Nash Aniruth,The mandate of this commission should be extended to investigate deaths ordissapearances of implicated inviduals
1568970152693858,1:22:33,Dan Brown,"The ""Cleaners"" got there quick or were following. The Guy that was in the passenger seat with his foot on the Gas was strapped in tight and ducked afterwards to catch his lift."
1568970153871434,1:22:34,Rob Nel,"There is a private investigator and private autopsy, reports coming"
1568970212191169,1:23:32,Willem Drotsky,David saperstein agree a life sentence behind bars means for ever. You must have the right to optionally request a death penalty as optional. My personal right not to spend my whole life in jail.
1568970234799043,1:23:55,Nash Aniruth,"Infact, perhaps this commission is the future of south africa's governance issues, this is true transparency"
1568970249123444,1:24:09,Dan Brown,"Gavin Watson didn't develop a Conscience overnight. He was cocky that no-one would finger him, because he knew too much. Zuma shed Crocodile tears but in Private was so... relieved along with others."
1568970332985316,1:25:33,Nash Aniruth,"Infact this commission has more dignity than parliament, its clear to see that those in parly are not serious as this commission"
1568970346081021,1:25:46,Nash Aniruth,"integrity, i mean"
1568970348816042,1:25:49,Rob Nel,When is Zuma coming back to commission??
1568970407970501,1:26:48,Rob Nel,"I mean after Hlaudi, I need another laugh"
1568970431942332,1:27:12,clive oconnell,"Nash Too true, but not a high hurdle"
1568970455146064,1:27:36,gert pretorius,"Indeed Nash, hopefully in retrospect these issues should never be repeated"
1568970511543029,1:28:32,gert pretorius,All humans are free but a small group knows it
1568970514373362,1:28:35,Nash Aniruth,"Gert, It looks like this commission will fix alot of these loop-holes that people have been using to abuse their responsibilities"
1568970539605448,1:29:00,danie schoeman,The crocodile tears was only shed because no more R300000 per month.
1568970544996716,1:29:05,clive oconnell,Who will give EFF slap 👋 it’s now illegal

1568970597618236,1:29:58,gert pretorius,"If yes but, if something happen to judge Zondo the commision is absolved"
1568970639887883,1:30:40,gert pretorius,"Well said Nash, look at the future 👏"
1568970645042627,1:30:45,Nash Aniruth,"True, its a very thin line, i presume DCJ he is heavily protected?"
1568970755344778,1:32:35,Sthakathi Khumalo,I feel for September shame... she was given a very hard part of state capture and Zondo is not having it. Stay strong mbokodo you will learn one day
