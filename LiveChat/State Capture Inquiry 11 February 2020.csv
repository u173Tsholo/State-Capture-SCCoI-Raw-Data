1581418696398438,2:55:17,Kevin Billing,She thinks if she delays it will go away.

1581418822790519,2:57:22,Thamsanqa Nomayela,No one will convicted here at Zondo commission as Marikane no one was convicted and TRC no one convicted from Apartheid crimes. Its shame of commissions.
1581418824801981,2:57:25,Sam Monkoe,@Bev Daniels But he'd believe his own lies making him a tough opponent to beat.
1581418828057290,2:57:28,Gareth Hellyar,She doesn't know what her position was.
1581418837187895,2:57:37,Bev Daniels,"Vusi, she was HOD, which attends all meetings, but obviously she just sat in the corder"
