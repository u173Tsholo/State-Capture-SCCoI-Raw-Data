1566807455278748,10:54,Pheladi Lamola,Someone is sabotaging this commission. We can't be dealing with this issue all the time. People need to receive this rule 33 notices in time but there's always stories.
1566807466259194,11:05,Pastor J.J,Something gives me the impression so far that Ms Buthelezi has now got some stiff competition with this Advocate.
1566807514131014,11:53,Sarender Rekhotho,I`m watching from University Of Limpopo. and i`ve no idea as to what is actually going on.
1566807519699424,11:58,Glorify Gumede,@Antoinette Rader what is your answer? i'm asking seriously
1566807608101556,13:26,Glorify Gumede,So it's just the hair ?
1566807617871249,13:36,Glorify Gumede,none

1566807696140974,14:54,Glorify Gumede,The evidence leader is butchering names there but its ok

1566807788150660,16:26,Glorify Gumede,@Robert Russell noted and i guess you didn't see my other concern about the Blonde lady
1566807817711777,16:56,Glorify Gumede,She has almost pronounced all the names wrongly

1566807975053049,19:33,Sindiswa Moolman,I think the problem is the Chairs hearing.

1566808297287053,24:55,Recreate YOU Life Coaching and Image Consulting,Guys we have waited and fought for democracy. This is the very same division and discrimination that have brought us to this point. We are a diverse nation. instead of c
1566808396569298,26:35,Matome Mampa,Maybe the fruits part is an introduction to the Tsunami he's going to unleash

1566808639514921,30:38,makhosi nobhatyi,Zuma has to account we are looking that now
1566808684559020,31:23,Pastor J.J,@Sindiswa Moolman It seems like a lot about nothing so far. But I suspect that something beeeeeg is about to hit the fan.......

1566808892070453,34:50,Glorify Gumede,So it's probably us the public that din't know
1566808906164357,35:04,Glorify Gumede,i doubt he liked smoking like Mbeki
1566808909506518,35:07,Magda Seguin,The Zondo commission is a year old already
1566808942529190,35:40,Glorify Gumede,Mbeki and his long pipe will even smoke in parliament lol

1566808996012330,36:33,Lowkey Apparel,i hope we(taxpayers) didn't pay for the minister's cigarettes

1566809202872121,40:02,Ibo Thabo,@Magda Seguin Mr Zondo recently hint that might take over a year to go and I think is really worthy of it. Most of the time those against the commission is people want hid things.
1566809204335194,40:03,Glorify Gumede,thanks Mohale for correction
1566809219061259,40:16,Magda Seguin,He is corraborating Mr Maseko's testimony

1566809250861618,40:49,Magda Seguin,True @Ibo Thabo
1566809256849677,40:55,Glorify Gumede,over and above that he has also mentioned Manyi
1566809258538894,40:56,Anne M.,@Ibo Thabo Agree
1566809290222922,41:28,Kabelo Katjedi,"Does Zondo knows hw much is wasted in this commission mara,we hd Serithi commission which wasted our money & gives us wrong funding trying to protect thieves"
1566809305221638,41:43,Kabelo Katjedi,gave
1566809387708907,43:06,Ibo Thabo,Why can‚Äôt the commission have all in & out calls & conversation correspondence in the presidency? Why the commission can‚Äôt have all call records of the Guptas?
1566809388472209,43:06,Anne M.,@Kabelo Katjedi Do you think Judge Zondo won't deliver a fair report?
1566809392082014,43:10,Magda Seguin,"The Seriti commission had a completely different mandate,the entire ANC covered up the arms deal,it was only because de Lille blowed the whistle"
1566809398108229,43:16,Sindiswa Moolman,Won‚Äôt be surprised if JZ accuses this man of being the agent of the enemy after all this testimony.
1566809500007311,44:58,Pastor J.J,This Advocate seems very nervous
1566809501617486,45:00,Magda Seguin,Andrew Feinstein who was an ANC parliamentarian resigned ans wrote a book called 'After the Party' he relates the arms deal shenanigens in his book
1566809509177227,45:07,Ibo Thabo,@Anne M. Sometimes I have questions for the intelligence or sharpness of Mr Zondo
1566809549508265,45:48,Anne M.,"@Pastor J Yes, must be nerve wracking knowing everything you say and do is televised."
1566809621223791,46:59,Kabelo Katjedi,"ANNE M he might deliver a fair report bt based on the testimonies or statements frm different witnesses,i do believe they r nt giving him anything 2 report rather than blaming or protecting each other"
1566809647892085,47:26,Magda Seguin,With the public and NGOs knowing about the failed Seriti commission all the minute details of the Zondo commission will be disected.There is no room for biass
1566809705837002,48:24,Anne M.,@Ibo Thabo Possibly to lull the witness into saying more than they want to?
1566809780440771,49:38,Anne M.,"@Kabelo Katjedi If we as non legal people can see through the lies and BS of some of the witnesses, then I think the legal team will definitely see through it üòÉ"

1566810062698221,54:21,Ibo Thabo,"@Anne M. No, the witness or anyone talking there know & must be aware that what he or she is saying is not going to be any secrete and anyone can scrutinize their utterance 1/2"
1566810092013675,54:51,Magda Seguin,I was just joking @Ibo Thabo
1566810111252246,55:09,Ibo Thabo,@Anne M. I guess that is why even top law experts like Sikhakhane didn‚Äôt want Zuma to utter more nonsense when then later will hunt him 2/2
1566810117060849,55:14,funicanz,Minister Chabane died too soon.
1566810144330309,55:42,Sindiswa Moolman,"But not Watson , I guess @Pheladi Lamola"
1566810162588159,56:00,Anne M.,@Ibo Thabo You're right. All this evidence is now a public record.
1566810166784803,56:04,Pheladi Lamola,Gavin Watson Sindiswa

1566810175749946,56:14,Magda Seguin,"Yes,Minister Chabane is sorely missed"
1566810194600143,56:32,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Different guy I think. Fana Hlongwane was the bag man for the arms deal. This guy testifying was in the Office of Presidency working for Chabane.
1566810195851063,56:34,Lucretia Mohaswane,"ohh myself, my his soul rest in peace"

1566810458781533,1:00:56,Magda Seguin,It cant be Agrizzi...the headline says Bosasa ex√©cutive...Agrizzi resigned years ago
1566810490942604,1:01:29,Sindiswa Moolman,The AFU must start the asset forfeiture before they go to the beneficiaries. That may sound cold but we need our monies back.
1566810503853413,1:01:43,funicanz,"@Sindiswa Moolman , wow. Car accident naye."

1566810550714958,1:02:28,Magda Seguin,SABC just announced that it is Gavin Watson who died
1566810561224493,1:02:39,Derek Main,RE Gavin Watson - that's very fishy. I smell a rat. The criminals must be very happy
1566810568916844,1:02:47,Ibo Thabo,Why don‚Äôt the commission asked the phone records between Zuma & minister Chabane?
1566810593959365,1:03:12,makhosi nobhatyi,Record will speak itself üíÉüíÉüíÉ
1566810600532963,1:03:18,Magda Seguin,With all the political killings I sometimes want to be a conspiracy theorist....
1566810620568761,1:03:39,Derek Main,Seems almost like a Brett Kebble suicide.
1566810624452589,1:03:42,Makwa Choma,I dont know why our african brothers n sister keep on voting for ANC N THEIR FRIENDS in our neibhouring countries
1566810637988998,1:03:56,carnoth ngomane,"@Derek Main very fishy indeed, now the commission will only hinge on Agrizzi's testimony"

1566810728097860,1:05:27,Sindiswa Moolman,Watson wanted to die. Why was he driving a Toyota Corolla when he could have driven a Porsche
1566810733759526,1:05:32,Anne M.,"@Magda Seguin Hmmm, me too."
1566810749194171,1:05:47,Ndou Fhati,we need clarification on that
1566810751245797,1:05:49,Pheladi Lamola,Zuma lied.
1566810755671543,1:05:54,Nkosinathi Tokwe,Gaven Watson Bosasa boss has died

1566810781609120,1:06:20,Ibo Thabo,"we need the full records of this call, it will solve the whole issue"
1566810797203473,1:06:35,Derek Main,The fact is Gavin Watson should have been in jail ages ago - before he could do himself any harm.
1566810829267446,1:07:07,makhosi nobhatyi,Gavin Watson runs before get his 15 years

1566814071055306,2:01:09,Magda Seguin,So the mortuary confirmed that it is Gavin Watson....I will only believe it if I see his body...too many political killings in SA and in Africa.The scene is already sanitised.

1566814295454192,2:04:54,Ibo Thabo,Why Zondow never asked Zuma the similar question on why he remember something happened near 30 years ago in details?
1566814313406853,2:05:12,Francois Cape Town,They better put some armed guards at that mortuary. Just now Watson inexplicably wakes up and flies out to Dubai via Waterkloof Air Force base on one of the Gupta planes fueled and paid for by ex No 1
1566814374740926,2:06:13,Magda Seguin,There is an argument among news agencies of confirmation of Watsons death and if it was really him...Twitter is aflush with his death yet there is NO CREDIBLE confirmation that it is him
