1555400526697251,8:40,carnoth ngomane,"why doesnt he want to be cross examined, is he hiding something, his evidence needs to be tested"
1555400539844396,8:53,makhosi nobhatyi,Gordhan is not going to fall down ngamasela down
1555400576553535,9:30,funicanz,So.. Pravin doesn't want his version to be cross examined? We must just believe his version as it stands.
1555400579665113,9:33,Bophelo Malapela,So Mayane being granted leave to cross examine is political agenda?
1555400591381955,9:45,makhosi nobhatyi,It’s a fight back by moyane and all of this thieves
1555400607427971,10:01,carnoth ngomane,he cant say things about people and expect it to take it as it is
1555400631481859,10:25,Tarisai Kadungure,Cross examination its about testing the evidence provided by a witness . The witness must therefore not fear anything if their evidence is true
1555400653003599,10:46,sikhumbuzo crispen sibanda,kkkkk Tom must come before the commision before with his evidance before cross examing any one kkkk
1555400676529141,11:10,Nelson Musoliwa,Justice must take its course for Fairness to all
1555400698884451,11:32,Pheladi Lamola,I'm not sure about fighting for Malema but I want Pravin to be cross-examined. He can't just give his version and go on his merry way. The Commission must be seen to be fair to everyone.
1555400704965687,11:38,carnoth ngomane,@makhosi nobhatyi you maybe right but if gordan is certain his evidence is correct why doesnt he want it to be tested
1555400746609335,12:20,carnoth ngomane,@Pheladi Lamola i agree with you
1555400756753335,12:30,Magda Seguin,Last night was really devastating with the Notre Dame fire
1555400765075002,12:38,zanmbeki,if Parrafin doesnt want to be cross-examined then he must shut his mouth.
1555400765206772,12:38,Pheladi Lamola,@Tarisai Kadungure Agreed.
1555400773894095,12:47,makhosi nobhatyi,"He will come here, but what you don’t know Moyane has no ground, he can fail even in court, he was was proven ill approval for increments for Makwakwa without treasury"
1555400780269302,12:54,Nkanyezi Vilakati,Let Private Gorhan be cross examined is he superior than any South African
1555400817536070,13:30,Wayne Serame,he must appear even in court witnesses are questioned by accused persons
1555400827812730,13:41,Amanda Watson,"@Nkanyezi Vilakati Same for Moyane, is he too precious to testify?"
1555400854727016,14:08,carnoth ngomane,@makhosi nobhatyi i fully agree with you but it doesnt mean Gordaan shouldnt be cross examined
1555400882581054,14:36,Magda Seguin,"But friends,Moyane was proved to have been a Gupta stooge implicated in state capture by the courts...he is clutching at straws"
1555400902811955,14:56,funicanz,"@Amanda Watson , you have summed it up. They're the same. They've played this game at SARS, now here. We're used to this script especially between them."
1555400910814285,15:04,Nkanyezi Vilakati,Private Gorhan must fall together with his Cabal and Stratcom crew👇👇👇👇
1555400927436881,15:21,Magda Seguin,Moyane destroyed SARS..the Nugent Commission was clear
1555400931939676,15:25,Nelson Musoliwa,Justice account to law not to individuals or political parties so justice must prevail in this particular instance.
1555400945132579,15:39,makhosi nobhatyi,"Carnoth ngomane, Gordhan knows moyane is angry since he took him to court for approval of salaries and bonuses without treasury approval, he is fighting back here, which is not a court of law"
1555400990952141,16:24,Eslon Eslon,The issue is not that Gordan refuse to be cross examined but that Dali Mpofu want to bring issue rogue unit which was not part of the Pravin evidence
1555400994223844,16:28,Gxobilahle KaGandaya,I did not know there could be anything suspicious about Prav...who has since posed as Mr Tell IT All
1555400998558058,16:32,Nelson Musoliwa,So whether Pravin is cross examined or not it must be by the law nothing more nothing less
1555401022806065,16:56,Aniceth De Missamou,"The rule says for you to cross examine any witness, you must first give you testimony then you're allowed to cross examine a witness."
1555401031479570,17:05,carnoth ngomane,"@makhosi nobhatyi Ghordan implicated moyane on his testimony and he should be cross examined, unless he is hiding something"
1555401056472740,17:30,Amanda Watson,Someone says something somebody doesn't like then it's stratcom instead of interrogating what it is you don't like. It's the supreme bullshit argument.
1555401057829473,17:31,Allan 28,Just get to the verdict chief
1555401084203700,17:57,Nkanyezi Vilakati,I concur with u @Nelson Musoliwa let justice prevail
1555401088452071,18:02,Gugulethu Dube,Moyane in his bid to cross examine Gordhan also raises new questions which were never alleged at the commission but at different points in his interraction with Gordhan
1555401107327489,18:21,makhosi nobhatyi,"Moyane was a puppet of Zuma, when economic crisis was bad, he turned against treasury saying sars was doing well collecting trillions Rand, which we heard yesterday that he manipulated reports"
1555401109678472,18:23,Allan 28,@Amanda Watson Interrogating is what is being sought to be archived but Pravin does not want that
1555401126121910,18:39,VICTOR SIWEYA,he must come to give his testimony first before he eximine others
1555401142809855,18:56,Magda Seguin,"The do called 'rogue unit' never existed.The EFF is fuelling this against Gordhan,they supported Monyane up till today.Fishy business."
1555401148316675,19:01,Eslon Eslon,The truth is that Dali want to use the commission to bring the Rogue unit and discredit Pravin evidence
1555401224115346,20:17,Magda Seguin,Moyane fought time and again to stay relevant...he is heavily implicated in state capture
1555401256221361,20:50,Aniceth De Missamou,Did Moyane give a statement for him to want to cross examine Pravin?
1555401265584061,20:59,funicanz,"@Eslon Eslon , that's the truth. They want to use this platform to revive Moyane's dismissal. Mpofu's tactics."
1555401270348333,21:04,carnoth ngomane,@Eslon Eslon if Ghordan's testimony if legit there is no way in which they will discredit it. My question is why doesnt he want to be cross examined?
1555401273939420,21:07,Magda Seguin,"No,he didnt"
1555401300512093,21:34,Magda Seguin,He even sent his lawyers to testify for him at the Nugent commission
1555401346088924,22:19,Aniceth De Missamou,"Without any statement from Tom, how would the commission legal team will also cross examine him?"
1555401365750651,22:39,carnoth ngomane,if Ghordan's testimony is credible then it should be open for cross examination.
1555401378695201,22:52,Magda Seguin,Dali Mpofu came across very unprofessional at the Commission here..revisit it on YouTube.
1555401382323611,22:55,makhosi nobhatyi,Moyane has no evidence rather than Rogue unit which was dismissed many times by NPA and ssa
1555401418292035,23:32,C S,Granted or not ?
1555401445513426,23:59,Eslon Eslon,"@carnoth, Moyane and Mpofu has another agenda and Pravin knows that well"
1555401474946530,24:28,makhosi nobhatyi,"Moyane cries is baseless coz he is guilty, the reason this economy go down, when he gave Guptas vat"
1555401482520189,24:36,Aniceth De Missamou,"The Gupta tried the same thing, no statement but yet want to test the witness evidences. No law at all. They must first read the rules of the commission b4 trying their luck."
1555401521732251,25:15,Yvonne Morudu,it is all about continuing with looting
1555401546168111,25:39,carnoth ngomane,@Eslon Eslon thats true but it doesnt mean Ghordan mustn't be cross examined
1555401576565338,26:10,Magda Seguin,Today a SARS employee is facing disciplinary who gave the Guptas R460m VAT return ordered by Moyane..she will probably lose her job too.The payments were made via third parties
1555401588738595,26:22,Quintin Jacobs,its seems Parrafin is very powerful
1555401589783500,26:23,Nkanyezi Vilakati,If Pravin Gordan is cross examined his lies will be exposed
1555401605208462,26:38,Magda Seguin,What lies?
1555401611589911,26:45,Quintin Jacobs,@Nkanyezi Vilakati INDEED
1555401628009743,27:01,Aniceth De Missamou,"@Elson, Mpofu must wait his turn as the VBS scandal still need to come forward. Mpofu and the EFF are among the beneficiaries of that looting."
1555401633410364,27:07,Nkanyezi Vilakati,@Quintin Jacobs 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1555401647467801,27:21,Eslon Eslon,Mark my word the eff will noise if Zondo refuse to grant the cross examination
1555401683880194,27:57,Quintin Jacobs,but @Nkanyezi Vilakati Mr. Joshua Doore has powerful and influential friends
1555401688085032,28:01,Yvonne Morudu,yes EFF have to protect the looters bcz they are the champs in looting
1555401690320697,28:04,funicanz,And they will use Adv. Mxolisi Zondo to discerdit DCJ.
1555401727797286,28:41,Nkanyezi Vilakati,@goolamv Stop exposing your exposing your stupidity
1555401732302503,28:45,Magda Seguin,"The EFF will use Judge Zondo's brother excuse if it is denied,that is their MO"
1555401734877546,28:48,makhosi nobhatyi,"I will defend those who stand here to speak the truth nothing but the truth, why there is no more and lot of protesters across the country, no service delivery bcoz no money"
1555401769133458,29:23,Magda Seguin,@Funicanz Exactly
1555401800145051,29:54,Chief Ntuli,"the rules of the commission are clear, if you want to cross examine, firstly you have to present your own version."
1555401869037766,31:02,Amanda Watson,"@Magda Seguin It seems @Nkanyezi Vilakati has inside information, he should share it with DCJ Zondo..."
1555401892238557,31:25,Musa Bakiti,Chair the ruling is too long
1555401924473691,31:58,Felix Muyoba,@Musa Bakiti 😂😂
1555401928209098,32:02,Magda Seguin,"I am extremely concerned about the EFF,they are not fit to govern.Parliament is like a shebeen for them,raucous behaviour and no decorum."
1555401964748466,32:38,Magda Seguin,@Amanda he didn't answer my question...it does
1555401970934145,32:44,funicanz,"Should Chair deny this application, there will be a press conference at 11:00"
1555401978590539,32:52,Aniceth De Missamou,Moyane has not given his version and yet waist money on applying for Leave to Cross Examine a witness. He must have a lot of cash to throw around?
1555401992378995,33:06,Magda Seguin,Malema is a dictator in the making
1555401998035259,33:12,funicanz,🏃🏃

1555402070972655,34:24,Naledzani Mashau,leave to cross examine mr paraffin gordan is denied

1555402093770904,34:47,Keatlaretse Phetwe,Zondo is also uncle Tom mos...
1555402094265730,34:47,Yvonne Morudu,he is Edi AMIN even his comrade in EFF are scared of him a dictator of note
1555402101684003,34:55,Amanda Watson,"lol, there was no bullet, only a blank"
1555402102485821,34:56,makhosi nobhatyi,Moyane must first tell us he accept or denied allegations put by mr Gordhan
1555402115692133,35:09,Chief Ntuli,Moyane must first provide his own version and then apply for leave to cross examine Pravin
1555402115948508,35:09,Sindiswa Moolman,Another waste of money by Tom Moyane
1555402137172150,35:30,Magda Seguin,@funicanz what about the militarization of the EFF? It reminds me of Idi Amin
1555402158500950,35:52,Eslon Eslon,Guys remember the eff was here the day Pravin appeared and attack the commission
1555402158625574,35:52,SONGEZO MNCOKO,"leave the eff alone, and deal with social, political and economic ill this country if facing cz of ANC"
1555402181168253,36:15,Mbuyiseli Mkalipi,Dali must give Monyane his money back
1555402199344121,36:33,Ozzy Ozzy,we dont REALLY DONT Care how you feel about CIC
1555402201836697,36:35,Quintin Jacobs,hopefully the Public Proctector is scared of Parrafin and his cabal
1555402210068210,36:43,zanmbeki,the fact that Pravin's Lawyers are not here shows tgwy know the verdict
1555402218358179,36:52,Nkanyezi Vilakati,Seserthembe PP may she can deal with the untouchable Gordan decisively
1555402220984113,36:54,Yvonne Morudu,Dali mpofu is being bought by EFF to do their dirty job he is loosing every case
1555402234060764,37:08,Magda Seguin,They may even invade the venue that's their style
1555402240805910,37:14,Ozzy Ozzy,WE DONT CARE
1555402320990093,38:34,Yvonne Morudu,incompetent Dali Mpofu and Mabuza

1555402329399861,38:42,Magda Seguin,I always remind people that Malema was 12 years old when Masina was released from prison.His mentor was Peter Mokaba of 'kill the Boer fame
1555402340820531,38:54,Magda Seguin,*Madiba
1555402357259101,39:10,makhosi nobhatyi,Dali is angry also coz he loose his Job 😃😃😃
1555402357432338,39:10,Amanda Watson,All Moyane has is smoke from the charred ashes of his career as a state capturer-in-chief
1555402358536714,39:12,Quintin Jacobs,Zondo is captured
1555402382555032,39:36,Yvonne Morudu,EFF will never get anywhere
1555402392551429,39:46,Ozzy Ozzy,GET TO THE POINT ZONDO
1555402393066156,39:46,funicanz,"@Magda Seguin ... let's leave it there. We might just find ourselves blocked, even though we aren't attacking but sharing our views.😉"
1555402407850929,40:01,Amanda Watson,@Quintin Jacobs Prove it.
1555402431661026,40:25,Magda Seguin,@funicanz you are right
1555402436848773,40:30,Nelson Musoliwa,A knowledgeable law practitioner would know how broad the defectives are in an application for leave to cross examined a witness to avoid clutching on a straw.
1555402444435717,40:38,funicanz,"@Quintin Jacobs , don't start."
1555402456362907,40:49,Nkanyezi Vilakati,Zondo and the Cabal crew have dis-legitimized the commission
1555402494584894,41:28,Amanda Watson,@Nkanyezi Vilakati​ Zondo and the Cabal crew have dis-legitimized the commission
1555402497136950,41:30,Quintin Jacobs,@Amanda Watson so why cant Parrafin not be cross examine
1555402529199941,42:02,Amanda Watson,Shhhh @Quintin Jacobs The Judge is literally telling you right now
1555402556260625,42:29,LonwaboLloyd Miggels,PG must be cross examine
1555402559263985,42:32,Quintin Jacobs,Zondo using Nugent what about the KPMG rapport of the Rogue Unit
1555402559496081,42:32,makhosi nobhatyi,Moyane must be arrested
1555402592215092,43:05,Quintin Jacobs,@LonwaboLloyd Miggels never Parrafin is squeeky clean
1555402612115543,43:26,Nkanyezi Vilakati,Zondo is having overtime to justify why the Paraffin price should not be reduced so that our people can have access to it😂😂😂😂
1555402619173900,43:32,Chief Ntuli,Whoever wants to cross examine Pravin must first state their version
1555402633011105,43:46,Jacob John,I think most people fail 2 distinguish Mpofu as an advocate nd Eff chairperson. Its very premature to try nd link Mpofu's profession nd EFF.I believe he doesn't get any mandate from EFF on this case.
1555402645875192,43:59,Quintin Jacobs,blah blah spinning spinning
1555402647049772,44:00,funicanz,"My assumption, I stand to be corrected. Moyane was advised to use this platform to fight for his job one last time. There's no way, if he doesn't dispute the Nugent's final report."
1555402672499023,44:26,Magda Seguin,Mpofu is a member of the EFF executive
1555402676705049,44:30,LonwaboLloyd Miggels,if he is why he is afraid to be cross examine
1555402677457187,44:30,Cerebis,Again gained Huge respect for the DCJ. He is a just man and our Country needs more like him.
1555402678163418,44:31,funicanz,Time wasted.
1555402692735473,44:46,funicanz,"@Magda Seguin , hence..."
1555402693409176,44:47,Quintin Jacobs,Its public fact that Parrafin used the Rogue Unit to get dirt on his enemies
1555402713954173,45:07,Magda Seguin,@funicanz yes...
1555402724498604,45:18,Amanda Watson,Did he? @Quintin Jacobs Please provide links?
1555402724812208,45:18,Chris Welensky,@funicanz unfortunately that's exactly what McBride did the past few days
1555402733015088,45:26,Derek Main,@Quintin Jacobs Give us one example.
1555402774021470,46:07,Amanda Watson,Moyane does not dispute or deny Gordhan's allegations....
1555402777724577,46:11,Bophelo Malapela,Those asking why PG does not want to be cross-examined or impugning the credibility of the commission are not paying attention to the judgment being delivered by DCJ Zondo because it is boring
1555402829631390,47:03,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ funicanz yes I can agree with you, moyane have more money, cigarettes smuggling dodging on his sight"
1555402832252481,47:05,Magda Seguin,Moyane is running from court to court and commission to commission wasting our time
1555402901074260,48:14,Magda Seguin,@Bophelo Malapela true
1555402918576045,48:32,mbuso sibisi,dali is daily
1555402923255535,48:37,Keatlaretse Phetwe,"black people slamming black elderly leaders idiotic. I know moyane personally and if yall did, you would all change ur mind about him..."
1555402928857984,48:42,Amanda Watson,@goolamv Can't blame the lawyer for his clients shortcommings.
1555402951432242,49:05,lubha lubha,@goolamv i guess you are a great one hey. hence u hv time to post on you tube
1555402959973610,49:14,Lorna Kavanagh,"Moyane, EFF and Mpofu .... says quite alot ..."

1555407203273719,1:59:56,Joyful Technologies,"moyane is frustrated, as he will never, ever get our hard earned money. He must just forget and look for another job."
1555407304134711,2:01:37,Magda Seguin,"Paul O'Sullivan did great work,work the SAPS and NPA should have done.They hate his guts and pursue him relentlessly for highlighting their shenanigens"
1555407375718757,2:02:49,Robert Russell,By dragging him off a flight for having two passports.... how pathetic @Magda Seguin
1555407379281274,2:02:53,funicanz,"So when Adv. Pretorious says, I will deal with it later, he means what he is doing?! So"
1555407409208506,2:03:22,Musa Bakiti,Adv Maleka bring Agrizzi back before elections plese.
1555407428125597,2:03:41,Nhlanhla Nsele,if u were Moyane i would just file a new affidavit with proper facts and ask to come to the commission and give evidence...that will lure Gordhan to ask to cross exermine
1555407438522599,2:03:51,Eslon Eslon,"@Magda Seguin, who's Paul O'Sullivan?"
1555407439754798,2:03:53,Bas Mdaka,This commission is a joke
1555407462354667,2:04:15,Magda Seguin,@Robert Russell they arrested both him and his assistant on false charges...they are desperate to jail and denigrate him
1555407502641094,2:04:56,Musa Bakiti,@Bas Mdaka umdaka what is the joke of this commission?
1555407505125451,2:04:58,Mike Moja,"@Bas Mdaka if it is joke, i guess you are free to switch off"
1555407511129932,2:05:04,Daniel Prinsloo,@Bas - the entire government is a joke
1555407529686283,2:05:23,Robert Russell,That was chucked out of court and I hear he is suing the Minster of Police for wrongful arrest @Magda Seguin
1555407558458420,2:05:52,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I simply don't remember the names and details. I'm old - forgive my memory. You could always watch yesterday's evidence if you want to. It's all there.
1555407581597055,2:06:15,Magda Seguin,"@Eslon Eslon long story, but short version, he is Irish/South African private investigator..look him up"
1555407637317124,2:07:10,Magda Seguin,Yes I saw it too @Robert Russell
1555407654504489,2:07:28,funicanz,"Corruption within the ANC is rife and cruel, to the society."
1555407678763338,2:07:52,Derek Main,@funicanz Too true - from top to bottom.
1555407721098069,2:08:34,Musa Bakiti,@Derek Main the mountains are old not you Derek
1555407747926415,2:09:01,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha They were definitely mentioned yesterday. I just can't be bothered to listen to it again - but you can if you want the details.
1555407817307939,2:10:10,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha @Musa Bakiti Thanks for the compliments guys - I'm flattered.
1555407842534770,2:10:36,Eslon Eslon,@Nhlanhla.. Tom Moyane won't do that bcoz he will expose his skelanyana skeletons
1555407873010167,2:11:06,Musa Bakiti,Derek let us vote for ANC as long as JG Zuma is in that's how you can thank me
1555407888329276,2:11:21,Magda Seguin,The ANC stole the future of the generation who was born in 1994...They only saw corruption in their lifetime
1555407894086175,2:11:27,Wildthing,due to all this corruption we have less police on the street to protect and enforce law.
1555407907140888,2:11:40,Derek Main,@Musa Bakiti You're a real joker 🤣
1555407909483944,2:11:43,funicanz,"If they weren't offered bribes and agreeing to maneuver tenders. They were spending our tax money on themselves selfishly. Imagine, wanting radio systems to be installed in your car as if he is a DJ."
1555407920778753,2:11:54,Joseph Gumede,from Judges to Ministers no one whose genuine. stream must be a debate at Parlamant nothing will solve we as
1555407923637438,2:11:57,Magda Seguin,And bribery is rife
1555407977706928,2:12:51,Derek Main,@Sibonakaliso Gumede Unfortunately not much debating happens at parliament - it's a circus.
1555407978646866,2:12:52,Joseph Gumede,"there all swimming in corruption,"
1555408000952406,2:13:14,Musa Bakiti,@Thando Nkutha Ya man
1555408011131742,2:13:24,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Hey! I'm doing all of those so I must be alright. 😃

1555408109466554,2:15:02,Joseph Gumede,system even at Parlamant is the same. Corruption is OUR trandition
1555408113373640,2:15:07,Wildthing,"it's time to set very high jail time for any corruption. no matter who, colour, gender. it is treason against the country and it's people."
1555408130040777,2:15:23,Magda Seguin,Cele made SAPS a quasi military outfit when he was police minister the first time now we have 'general's who never fought in a war
1555408141795460,2:15:35,Derek Main,@Michael Wild I'd go for chopping off a hand.
1555408153603884,2:15:47,Wildthing,or heads

1555408413568972,2:20:07,Joseph Gumede,one day is going to be in.volve also 🤣🤣
1555408418128571,2:20:11,David Hotz,This evidence is truly nasueauting and shocking. shameful. the planned desttrucion of the law enfocrement servics is horrendous
1555408419472187,2:20:12,Eslon Eslon,when are we expecting the eff press conference to attack and accuse the commission of protecting Pravin and his cabals
1555408449941063,2:20:43,Joseph Gumede,Corruption is OUR Culture
1555408472427596,2:21:05,Magda Seguin,"@Sibonakaliso Gumede we should never lose hope,we are resilient and committed to see our country come put of this corrupt morass"
1555408485326836,2:21:18,Robert Russell,@David Hotz .... it's not horrendous.... it's TREASON
1555408512231832,2:21:45,Magda Seguin,@Eslon Eslon😄
1555408522451119,2:21:55,Joseph Gumede,We must do like China
1555408565540579,2:22:39,Bhuga ZA,i wonder which fool is going 2b arrested after dis commission.....
1555408595567311,2:23:09,David Hotz,@Thando Nkutha there is no point in engaing with yoiiu. I can see your thread. you have come to dissemble. Your comments i can see add nothing but to obfuscate and prevaricate. pathetic.
1555408596671914,2:23:10,Magda Seguin,We have recent examples of how people made a change peacefully: Sudan and Algeria
1555408619632155,2:23:33,Joseph Gumede,If you are corruption at Chine you face fireing squed
1555408622406906,2:23:35,Eslon Eslon,"@Magda Seguin... Please don't laugh, That's what their leaders get us used to"
1555408661222879,2:24:14,Magda Seguin,@David Hotz I blocked Thando Nkutha ages ago
1555408693625649,2:24:47,Magda Seguin,I know @Eslon Eslon point taken
1555408815091933,2:26:48,Robert Russell,This is like Spy vs Spy in the MAD magazine 😃
1555408883284972,2:27:56,ofhie Muofhe,When last did you use that yellow ruler
1555408904310370,2:28:17,Magda Seguin,"The detail of McBride' s testimony is phenomenal,the two reports which he explained yesterday that took up half the day is in the analysis.It is crucial evidence for when it reaches a court of law"
1555408905001007,2:28:18,kenneth mampa,This is like DD chasing Supra calling him thief
1555408920511842,2:28:33,Eslon Eslon,@Robert Russell... What do u mean by spy vs spy?
1555408980180733,2:29:33,Magda Seguin,I wish I kept my MAD magazines from my younger days @Robert Russell
1555409054777503,2:30:48,Norman Zwane,"@Eslon Eslon Ever piicked up a 'MAD"" magazine?"
1555409058407468,2:30:51,Robert Russell,Yeah they were really great Magda I should have done the same
1555409083618558,2:31:16,Eslon Eslon,why do I feel like Mcbride's testimony needs a higher arena than this commission?
1555409086620889,2:31:19,Nelson Musoliwa,CIS and IPID were ate each other's throat instead of providing services to the nation which is tantamount to treason.
1555409151670619,2:32:25,Wildthing,all very high ranked officers. first question is how did they get all the high ranks. its handed out like smarties nowadays.
1555409170739029,2:32:43,Magda Seguin,@Eslon Eslon I agree I hope Shamila Batohi start the prosecutions with this section of the commission...she has huge interest in cleaning out her backyard
1555409224997407,2:33:38,Nelson Musoliwa,@Elson i concur with u this testimonies is highly complicated
1555409263829045,2:34:17,Norman Zwane,"@Nelson Musoliwa State resources being used to sort out personal scores, at the expense of the paying public.This was the kind of murky waters JGZ must have wished for."
1555409383630094,2:36:16,David Hotz,@Norman Zwane not wished for... actively planned and exectured. M Thamm hightighted some evidence yesterday. shows th e trends of destruction of enforcement. see her FB thread.
1555409407748636,2:36:41,Nelson Musoliwa,@Norman you can say that again this is one of the major causes that collapsed the state
1555409414491794,2:36:47,Norman Zwane,McBride may also be guilty of taking his battles to the commission. The thread of fabricating testimony in exchange for jobs is nonetheless correctly located here.
1555409551703477,2:39:05,Magda Seguin,Goodness!Israel? They have the most sophisticated spyware...the new phone spying device cost millions.The Saudi government used it on Kashoggi
1555409628435898,2:40:22,Magda Seguin,The Saudis spied on Kashoggi and his whereabouts and consequently killed him brutally in the Turkish Saudi embassy.
1555409688069553,2:41:21,Norman Zwane,@Nelson Musoliwa There were enough greedy people to fight for positions and forget about their principal task. Zuma only needed dangle a carrot for the infighting to commence.
1555410017861469,2:46:51,Ndim Mavuks,"No personal battles, these shenanigans were pursued against the Head of IPID, an independent institution in terms of the constitution of the Republic. This is serious"
1555410034310368,2:47:07,Eslon Eslon,"Mcbride's evidence is highly complicated that it needs a bench of few judges to ventilate it not only Zondo and Pretorius, especially bcoz law enforcement agencies is at center stage really"
1555410086957034,2:48:00,Wildthing,The Smarties handed out
1555410107118620,2:48:20,Eslon Eslon,Patronage is a strong word to use
1555410162671854,2:49:15,Wildthing,Time to review all ranks and how they got them
1555410173597107,2:49:27,funicanz,"McBride's evidence is complicated, I do agree with you @Eslon Eslon . It doesn't measure Agrizzi's. His is close to home because these ministers complied in corrupting our country, period."
1555410252588204,2:50:46,Eslon Eslon,Plz proof the patronage you're referring to Mr. Mcbride
1555410256703548,2:50:49,Magda Seguin,SAPS should do away with military nomenclature...they are servants of the people not the army
1555410336342671,2:52:09,carnoth ngomane,"I think there's more in Mcbride's evidence and it needs a thorough examination, and Pretorius seem not to be up to the task"
1555410382575888,2:52:55,Norman Zwane,Long theory speech that makes sense but some evidence would come in handy
1555410401394652,2:53:14,Ndim Mavuks,"This is how you collapse state institutions for state capture, hit the heads and the whole edifice will come down crumbling. Mcbride, a hero, used his own money to defend the independence of IPID,"
1555410426717561,2:53:40,Eslon Eslon,"I can't imagine that DCJ Zondo has to sit analyze, examine all this information alone and make recommendations"
1555410429558695,2:53:43,Magda Seguin,Zuma shuffled his government on a regular basis...always at night.I think it was 9 or 11 times...every time someone new came in things were changed.The newcomers were Gupta state capture choices
1555410476790640,2:54:30,Magda Seguin,Brilliantly explained by McBride
1555410516103279,2:55:09,David Hotz,@Eslon Eslon he has a supportive investigative team. The evidence being led by pretorius isnot all the infomration that gets considered. I suggest you read the terms of the establ of the commission.
1555410529163256,2:55:22,nyiko nyiko,@madga .100%
1555410532385016,2:55:25,Ndim Mavuks,"He has not yet been reimbursed by the state for using his own money in defense of the Republic, he deserves the Order of the Companions of OR Tambo"
1555410543531386,2:55:37,carnoth ngomane,"@i feel so because whenever Mcbride bring up sme juicy topic Pretorius will often say it will be discussed in due cos, an element of laziness there"
1555410610620954,2:56:43,Magda Seguin,@nyiko nyiko thanks
1555410611575444,2:56:44,Eslon Eslon,"@carnoth ngomane... Imagine Zondo has to sit alone analyze, examine all this evidences..."
1555410660835241,2:57:34,carnoth ngomane,@Eslon Eslon its already a huge task
1555410694130206,2:58:07,xolisile mbejeni,water that two bottles
1555410731016207,2:58:44,Nelson Musoliwa,The rot in state was too deep as Robert is explaining here
1555410780751936,2:59:34,Dhiven Govender,can we please put him. in the new scorpions 2.0 🙏🏾🙏🏾
1555410876992648,3:01:10,David Hotz,"@carnoth ngomane , from your comments you may not understand the process., they r following affidavits. Items get dealtin a methodical fashion. you may not appreciate it but this is how it works."
1555410886421131,3:01:19,Magda Seguin,He has already been made Head of the Parliamentary Integrity Committee by CR...if the Zuma faction get rid of CR we are again in the same boat
1555410914407543,3:01:47,Magda Seguin,@David Hotz Exactly
1555410928044938,3:02:01,funicanz,Why adjourn if you will take a long adjournment at 13:00?
1555410984228125,3:02:57,Ndim Mavuks,"McBride, an intelligent, brave, loyal and patriotic South African, a true cadre who espouses the values of the glorious movement, the ruling party, the one and only ANC that lives and leads"

1555411011474966,3:03:24,Lorna Kavanagh,how depressing to hear Mcbrides opinion of the SAPS.
1555411029165563,3:03:42,carnoth ngomane,@David Hotz i know all that but energy thereof is lacking and some evidence from are left hanging with further questions
1555411182715988,3:06:16,Eslon Eslon,This commission was suppose to have two three judges along side Zondo plus evidence leaders to exact more infos from witnesses instead of two people exploring facts from witnesses
1555411213051277,3:06:46,Ndim Mavuks,"This so refreshing unlike the officers and ministers of the white minority government of apartheid, who hears nothing, seen nothing and know nothing until this day"
1555411318984007,3:08:32,Derek Main,"@Eslon Eslon The word ""patronage"" is not strong enough for what's happened here - it's outright criminality."
1555411354840120,3:09:08,Wildthing,"Ndim do you always need to bring back the past. this is related to bad management, lack of skills in the job and criminals, no matter the race colour or gender. law and order needs to come back."
1555411368277871,3:09:21,Ndim Mavuks,"The outcome was always no one is responsible, e.g Sharpville massacre"
1555411448901794,3:10:42,Ndim Mavuks,"African Refugee, and the outcome: No one is responsible in fact it was lies, lies, lies"
1555411490362112,3:11:23,makhosi nobhatyi,"Mahumapelo province working with premier league to defend JZ, destroy evidence which may implicate them, doing so with partnership with police officers"
1555411533078070,3:12:06,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks Take a look at how your glorious movement treats anyone with integrity eg. McBride. The ANC is now a cabal of criminals.
1555411587852526,3:13:01,Ndim Mavuks,"The ANC as an organisation never dealt with McBride, Derek"
1555411639981954,3:13:53,Ndim Mavuks,Let alone the fact McBride never accused the ANC of anything here
1555411736038151,3:15:29,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks His evidence here is laying bare how the ANC cadres treated him.
1555411761515532,3:15:54,Magda Seguin,What an indictment on Zuma government!!
1555411788892105,3:16:22,carnoth ngomane,"@Ndim Mavuks to some people ANC is a phobia,"

1555411873090045,3:17:46,Magda Seguin,All the decisions were made at the Gupta shebeen
1555411909363606,3:18:22,Derek Main,@Thami Ngwenya That we have yet to find out. But there was no protection for him from the ANC either.
1555411970494687,3:19:23,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I agree with that but it's not an either-or.
1555411995180869,3:19:48,Ndim Mavuks,"Exactly Thando, because what they did was said to be ""a crime against humanity"""
1555412002398307,3:19:55,Thami Ngwenya,Thin line between the party and government.
1555412026799173,3:20:20,Thami Ngwenya,C omission should look at that
1555412083312099,3:21:16,Magda Seguin,@Thami there was no line..just party interest
1555412101327049,3:21:34,Ndim Mavuks,"When De Lille called for an open public disciplinary hearing, the DA refused"
1555412146493454,3:22:19,Thami Ngwenya,LOOK AT PARTY INTEREST AND GOVERNMENT IS A PROBLEM NOT LIMITED TO ANC
1555412206384685,3:23:19,Eslon Eslon,Mcbride is somehow intelligent
1555412213747752,3:23:26,Magda Seguin,So many names implicated
1555412231509243,3:23:44,Ndim Mavuks,"And Honour him with everything he did pre and post apartheid, history will vindicate him"
1555412325072627,3:25:18,Magda Seguin,@Thami the last time I looked the ANC is the governing party and they have the majority vote.Time and again the opposition parties complained the the ANC executive has no accountability.
1555412372671568,3:26:05,Robert Russell,In the land of the blind.... the cyclops is king.... sounds like you and the ANC.... @Ndim Mavuks
1555412389139581,3:26:22,Ndim Mavuks,Eslon he is intelligent not somehow
1555412391819649,3:26:25,Thami Ngwenya,but is the responsibility of the parliament to look at failing system
1555412400140612,3:26:33,Magda Seguin,"The ANC is the national government overall,it's only the last two years metropoles are involved."
1555412401653080,3:26:35,Eslon Eslon,There's come the Mxolosi Zondo story now
1555412406133169,3:26:39,Abel Manyedi,@Thando Nkutha agree with u completely
1555412454778823,3:27:27,Magda Seguin,The ANC other AGAINST no confidence I Zuma NINE times...they ruined the country with their looting
1555412519906496,3:28:33,Thami Ngwenya,"BECAUSE OPPOSITION LACK IDEAS, FOCUS TOO MUCH ON ANC AND HAS NO AGENDA"
