1548677981332253,18:11,Michael Michael,Prescot no ways
1548678024423066,18:54,Jack Sparrow,@Prescott Smith‚Äã mineral resources aren't in big demand nowadays
1548678077653942,19:48,Peter Sant,Zuma was just a demon came to sell our country
1548678098776885,20:09,S Mhlabase Msibi-Gordon,jack sparrow what do you think the demand for land is?
1548678152992221,21:03,Jack Sparrow,"@S Mhlabase Msibi-Gordon demand for land is high, but nobody is going to get their own little piece, like they imagine"
1548678186085233,21:36,Peter Sant,we can't blame ANC by giving a person an opportunity to serve his people.yet changed to be corrupt
1548678238438634,22:29,Prescott Smith's Fly Fishing Academy,"Michael Michael well the root is the same we face here. the COLONIAL structures means they only gave you political INDEPENDENCE, while they buy the politicians by funding your elections."

1548678466401430,26:16,Lusalobe Kabamba,This is scary. it appears that the country was not only captured by the Guptas
1548678590568867,28:21,Ramasodi Sekgothe,The guptas are just a fraction of the corruption that took place during jacob's reign. Bosasa is corrupt.
1548678606303250,28:36,Prescott Smith's Fly Fishing Academy,"Jack sparrow MINERAL RESOURCES comes in many forms. it's not just gold, diamond, copper or platinum. Africa and blacks all over the world will never be truly Free unless apartheid truly ends."

1548685598849795,2:25:09,makhosi nobhatyi,Our money brother is gone R500 billion
1548685710166567,2:27:00,jeevan singh,Magda. The evidence appears overwhelming. so the authorities needs to act on the evidence and make the charges and arrests.
