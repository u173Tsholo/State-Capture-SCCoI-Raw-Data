1563972234116992,19:58,rohan barnard,Did Prof. Madonsela not start with this and then Mkhwebane took over?
1563972266456659,20:30,rohan barnard,She was acting and then won a grammy award for her role as acting director
1563972291184653,20:54,Jabu Malinga,"David, what we know is that Zuma was corrupted by the guptas. Before them he was corrupted by shaik shabeer"

1563972354639449,21:58,Dominic Przybylski,@Jabu Malinga Zuma was probably corrupt from birth.
1563972363511961,22:07,Jabu Malinga,"I do not know of Mbeki being corrupted and selling the country to a family, or Mandela before him. there will of course hav been corruption,but not at state capture levels"
1563972365296007,22:09,Nonzy,Yes Jabu. They were very hungry these guys and Thabo was slow.
1563972382161460,22:26,Mohamed Mia,@makhosi money is with guptas and others
1563972382193021,22:26,Samkelo Nxele,tjoh i cant keep up so many directors Hod's cfo mec it too much
1563972384192118,22:28,david jacobs,@Jabu Malinga Zuma was corrupt long before the Guptas i think .We know birds of a feather
1563972409681370,22:53,Jabu Malinga,"Like arms deal corruption, but less we forget, zuma is implicated in arms deal as well..with tint n co"
1563972423871968,23:08,rohan barnard,but the guptas has been there dor a loooooooooong time.... even before zuma
1563972439255546,23:24,Jabu Malinga,"David, yes, shaik was paying for his wifes house in dbn north long before he became president"

1563972471534095,23:56,Cerebis,The Arms deal was a sort off state capture corruption deal....Sarafina was the first known corrupt deal.
1563972483445106,24:07,Minoctar Sithole,ZUMA is going to jail that's why he is spilling the beans
1563972485391871,24:09,Khutso Malope,Thanks @Ewald Kruger
1563972498223089,24:21,Nonzy,Guptas have been waiting in shadows since the beginning of time. They only came out of the closet during zumas reign.
1563972509838085,24:33,Dominic Przybylski,Arms deal advertised JZ as somebody who took bribes so all bribers were interested in dealing with him.
1563972509979955,24:33,Jabu Malinga,"David, guptas wingled their way to the zumas table by giving dudzane a job, then ownership in certain companies. smart guptas"
1563972523358890,24:48,david jacobs,@Ewald Kruger This guy looks like a local taxi driver where i stay
1563972543214295,25:07,Pastor J.J,@Cerebis Yes u are rite. And the person implicated there was Nkosazana Dhlamini Zuma the ex wife of Jacob Zuma.
1563972560399322,25:24,Jabu Malinga,"yes, in terms of money/numbers, zuma is very stupid. while guptas wer stealing billions, they wer leaving him with few millions"
1563972580694926,25:44,david jacobs,and with the courts for now
1563972584154559,25:48,Khutso Malope,"@David Jacobs, you must be a taxi driver as well,"
1563972594679932,25:58,david jacobs,no lol
1563972605182002,26:09,Samkelo Nxele,so many position's in one derpatment each has it own role
1563972619412849,26:23,Dominic Przybylski,If they were offering R600 million to buy a finance minister I guess a president isn't cheaper.
1563972629727931,26:33,rohan barnard,The Guptas arrived in SA in 1993.... When they started meddling in our government affairs is unknown
1563972634761713,26:38,Jabu Malinga,"If you ask zuma to say this number, 1122334455 , will he be able to?"
1563972646524462,26:50,Ewald Kruger,👍 @Mrs Anderson

1563972666100221,27:10,Jabu Malinga,"Zuma proved that he knew nothing about maths, so billion or million to him looked d same, only 1st letter different"
1563972681147376,27:24,david jacobs,"@Jabu Malinga he will start one ,one ,two two etc lol"
1563972681268299,27:24,Ewald Kruger,He is at the moment the Acting Head from Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Free State
1563972686790001,27:30,carnoth ngomane,This witness knows it all but i doubt he will spill the beans
1563972687502256,27:31,Precious Ntshangase,"Foot, not food"
1563972700172426,27:44,Jabu Malinga,lol
1563972721307928,28:04,Dominic Przybylski,Foot soldiers are the people who do the dirty work.
1563972769672812,28:54,david jacobs,they must just arrest and jail 1 foot soldier then these foot soldiers will turn easily against their masters
1563972778404777,29:02,Anele Xhati,@Dominic Przybylski 🤣🤣🤣
1563972816528351,29:40,Nomcebo Dlakude,FOOT SOLDIERS??? CREATING JOBS???

1563972876172735,30:40,makhosi nobhatyi,I think Ace Magashule is busy now combine evidence which will contradict witnesses
1563972884436467,30:48,Cerebis,The Foot soldiers must be the guys who delivered the cows to Nkandla???
1563972885303373,30:49,Jabu Malinga,"commision waste of tax payers money, but at least here, we can see wer our money went"
1563972886462977,30:50,Mbuso Ndlovu,Who is this corruptionist testifiying here
1563972887940863,30:51,Donald Nzama,"Officials who must be closer to the people, by the people, in the people, as the people 😁"
1563972891648622,30:55,Dominic Przybylski,Foot soldiers are normally people with little or no authority.
1563972898606952,31:02,david jacobs,the commisssion hopefully will ensure that this state capture will never again
1563972899841126,31:03,Nonzy,I really like the guy at the back.
1563972931017080,31:35,Nomcebo Dlakude,Foot Soldier = Used people
1563972938632099,31:42,Khutso Malope,"I’m with you Bedazzled, I know what you talking about"
1563972950580280,31:54,Jabu Malinga,"don't be surprised, rama cr7 is not all clean. He was also a beneficiary of bee. where do u think he got his billions"
1563972955490044,31:59,Mr X,Will Ace and Zwane come to this commission or not if yes when i would like to here their side of the story.
1563972965066170,32:09,david jacobs,so as insignificant as we deem it hopefully it will lay down rules for the future if any after this sh&tt.
1563972968982327,32:13,Minoctar Sithole,where is mr 10%
1563972978526593,32:22,Tito 2000,Do you need to wash your hands sir?
1563972990371198,32:34,Precious Ntshangase,...but implementing agent is sought of Project Managers. Engineers will be reporting under this implementing urgency
1563972992005316,32:35,Jabu Malinga,"but bee was a legal system..unjust as far as im concerned, but sadly, legal..it benefited those with connections, not the masses"

1563973033351090,33:17,Nonzy,We will fall inlove with you Pastor.
1563973038580653,33:22,Dominic Przybylski,@Jabu Malinga I agree. How do you become a billionaire as a non-executive director? Only reason he was given directorships was to get inside line on government tenders.
1563973101213650,34:25,Jabu Malinga,"Dominic, exactly, but hoefully he is not serving certain families for money as he has enough..but what is enough?"
1563973114093281,34:38,Nonzy,hahah Mrs Anderson
1563973123034947,34:47,Dominic Przybylski,I read on IRR (Institute of Race Relations) site that CR was always late for meetings and always just voted with majority.

1563973706882866,44:30,makhosi nobhatyi,@Dominic Przybylski yes they are different but because he never discussed this to his father I think CR would stop him joining Bosasa if he was aware that he is looking for a contract

1563973858989555,47:02,Dominic Przybylski,@makhosi nobhatyi Let's hope so. CR is a lot more sophisticated than JZ so if he is crooked he'll hide it much better. He has been inspirational so far and I like what he says but why invisible before

1563980367207754,2:35:30,TG Swartlane,"@Diss & Dad i see what you did there chair, feasibility"
1563980379360479,2:35:43,Cerebis,Yes I would Diss
1563980398580348,2:36:01,Peet Venter,@Jabu Malinga The 100+100 is what èàch beneficiary would need to pool.
1563980419932513,2:36:23,Jabu Malinga,"Peet, so 20 Mil would be more than enough then?"
1563980482603890,2:37:25,Pastor J.J,@Diss & Dad If there was a dedicated channel on Live Court Tv I will
1563980490361071,2:37:33,TG Swartlane,"@Diss & Dad the claims you talking about, was it for yesterday or today?"
1563980506526067,2:37:49,Jabu Malinga,"lol, nationalise minerals, u mean just lik Eskom, saa, sabc ??? hehehhehe"
1563980575675481,2:38:59,Cerebis,@I Am Free Mineral rights were nationalised some time back already and has not seem to give SA any benefits. SA missed the last upswing in the world all together because we are fighting each other
1563980621654102,2:39:45,Jabu Malinga,"ANC cannot run a race, u want them to run everytin and nationalise.. I think privatisation is the answer.. sell saa, Eskom and other, jus lik they did Telkom and look how well Telkom is doin"
1563980688712991,2:40:52,Jabu Malinga,"allow other companies to build power stations and provide power, not only eskom"
1563980694673316,2:40:58,roberto wilco,Jabu who would buy those businesses
1563980735008904,2:41:38,Jabu Malinga,"Roberto, the name SAA alone is worth a lot, so they may not get a lot, but keep 40% and sell 60%"
1563980744238942,2:41:47,roberto wilco,South Africa is uninvestable for foreign companies
1563980773425483,2:42:16,Jabu Malinga,"Diss and Dad, if their is completion and government regulations on price, then it wil be fine"
1563980774631669,2:42:17,roberto wilco,Would they take the debt too
1563980784691946,2:42:28,Cerebis,@I Am Free Look it up.......Existing mines had rto apply for the rights to mine. Zwane and co used that law to steal the Gupta mine from it's previous owners.
1563980784930141,2:42:28,Peet Venter,To feed 20 families you would need 4000 cows in milk from day one if you exclude having to repay the ground and initial infrastructure.
1563980809874642,2:42:53,Jabu Malinga,"Roberto, they wil hav to pay back the debt over time, not right away..solutions r ter"
1563980817804017,2:43:01,roberto wilco,"Put all those companies in bankruptcy ,they are trading while insolvent"
1563980857828867,2:43:40,roberto wilco,I dont think foreign companies would put money into South Africa to much risk
1563980862672036,2:43:46,Jabu Malinga,Eskom at the moment giv a dam about servin the ppl and keeping prices down..we are currently payin more and more
1563980920032673,2:44:43,Cerebis,@roberto wilco Correct! Currently SA gets zero DFI mainly because of poor ANC government policies
1563980945428813,2:45:09,Sthakathi Khumalo,Indians I tell you.. Guptas brought the hawks haha

1563981049901754,2:46:53,Jabu Malinga,Indians came to a foreign land and over time owned the land and owned the presidents of the land. every president had Indians at d back..hahahha
1563981072726670,2:47:15,Jabu Malinga,Can I get a tender too?
1563981102512449,2:47:45,Buti Mothoa,he was introduced by the hawks to the guptas🤔
1563981182722214,2:49:05,Jabu Malinga,"But look at the casinos, malls, dbn july horse racing, shows etc. Indians are full. without Indians, wer would our economy go?? so lets not demonise them."
1563981250100045,2:50:13,Lorna Kavanagh,There are plenty of genuine dairy farmers in SA who could have advised the dept.
1563981272559029,2:50:35,Cerebis,"@Jabu Malinga I agree! They are not all bad! In Uganda, the economy collapsed after amin chased them out!"
1563981325336463,2:51:28,Raymond Raymond,this guy doesn't know anything. IT company on a dairy project. He was supposed to investigate all this things. He is lying to the commission
1563981470325075,2:53:53,Cerebis,"@Diss & Dad I agree fully. In my career I travelled to Europe, UK, USA and Scandinavia. Seen that many time and got cross! I consume a lot of fruit and raw vegetables. General quality of SA fruit poor"
1563981506198102,2:54:29,Jabu Malinga,"Diss and Dad, what businesses r u referring to?"
1563981669840585,2:57:13,Cerebis,In SA there is a general false expectation of business. Business should not be expected to provide services that we as taxpayers pay the Government for.
1563981690159238,2:57:34,Jabu Malinga,"casinos contribute 30% and horse racing the same. The dbn july contributed almost 500 Million to the economy of kzn. but thos wer jus examples. Indians r everywer,not only ter"
1563981769775378,2:58:53,Jabu Malinga,"Indian r even at woolworths, shoprite, spar, restaurants, buying alcohol, everywer everywer..sometimes dbn is lik india..hahhahah"
1563981789041965,2:59:12,Peet Venter,@Diss & Dad. you'll be surprized to learn how many milk cow's meat are eaten daily.
1563981808664289,2:59:31,Jabu Malinga,"Diss and Dad, yes, but thats a complete different issue which I am not referring to..i am just referring to spending and who is spending money in SA"
1563981850124257,3:00:13,Jabu Malinga,"How Naidoo, I am stickin up for u"
1563981957003094,3:02:00,Peet Venter,@Diss & Dad A dead cow can't produce anything :-)

1563982144852169,3:05:08,Peet Venter,@Diss & Dad I'm saying that dairy cows contribute towards food security through their meat once they are slaughtered.
1563982180545299,3:05:44,Phuti Herbert Manamela,Point being????
1563982184947888,3:05:48,Jabu Malinga,Does a dairy cow taste like milk ..hehheheheh
1563982220266748,3:06:23,Jabu Malinga,"Guys, he is saying that once the cow dies, or is too old to produce milk, it wil be consumed as meat.. do u get it now???"

1563982427521208,3:09:51,Lorna Kavanagh,The crying shame of this whole debacle is that this project could have been handled by SA dairy board.
1563982444936693,3:10:08,Jabu Malinga,why is this goin on so late..its dark now
1563982463094931,3:10:26,Jabu Malinga,"Lorna, yes, but ace n co would not have benefited mara"
1563982561598297,3:12:04,Lucky Tsita,Jabu They want the truth to come out even in the dark
1563982641270984,3:13:24,Peet Venter,"@Diss & Dad. In Africa ""obesity"" is a sign of wealth."
1563982648532734,3:13:32,Lorna Kavanagh,Yes Jabu .... but still a crying shame because the farmers lost out .😥
