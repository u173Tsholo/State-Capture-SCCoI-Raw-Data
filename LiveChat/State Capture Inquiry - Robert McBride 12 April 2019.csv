1555056465798085,6:31,Katlego Peterson,"Karima Brown has a crus issue with the EFF. Now I beleive she's and ANC agent. She's asked about the PP and Pravin, and he somehow finds a way of blaming the EFF. Appalling!!"
1555056497460345,7:03,Melusi Ndlangisa,I'm hoping that turning of these pages and going through annexures will bear fruits of criminal charges and sentences of all corrupt leaders who looted cdes going forward.
1555056503609748,7:09,Granny Mokwena,he must drop some high ranking names today
1555056624603815,9:10,makhosi nobhatyi,"Kaklego Person PP has no case to charge Gordhan you would be surprised this is a fight back, Edward Zuma son was using the thing when Gordhan speaks out about corruption and state capture"
1555056637461729,9:22,Jack Sparrow,"@Katlego Petersonâ€‹ Karima Brown was Iqbal's lapdog, which places her integrity in serious doubt"

1555057144575399,17:50,Robert Russell,Malenema will use anything to create a diversion of the VBS scandal hanging over the EFF's head
1555057161372135,18:06,makhosi nobhatyi,I donâ€™t get you guys however we may be different from views but that doesnâ€™t give anyone a space to attack someone whose not black by color because she or he has point out problem

1555057435111461,22:40,welton paulse,"@Magda Seguin, and they planned these things quite well or so they thought"
1555057440519979,22:46,Ndim Mavuks,"Deep respect for people like McBride for the sacrifices including death row experiences in the course of a struggle against an evil system correctly described by the world ""a sin against humanity"""
1555057451229528,22:56,makhosi nobhatyi,"All these parties have interest what is happening with ANC and talk about it , not look at their parties what they are going to do for people, DA suppose to go to Alex listen to the people n respond"
1555057470211592,23:15,Robert Russell,"I said ""scandal"" this is by way of investigative journos reporting... I did not say they were implicated..@Mzu Yeko"
1555057508053743,23:53,Magda Seguin,CR promised a million houses in Alex yesterday yet there is NO space
1555057563910114,24:49,welton paulse,Under the zuma administation you had to do as you were told or you would have been shipped out
1555057645182091,26:10,welton paulse,"They thought MCBreezy was a moemish, mara this guy has got brains"
1555057647030671,26:12,Magda Seguin,@makhosi ANC never did anything in Alex for 24 years and yesterday CR had the gall to talk about sewerage flowing in he streets...the ANC must do serious introspection

1555057713731365,27:19,welton paulse,"@Magda Seguin, you know this time of the year when iits close to voting one see how POLITICAL PARTIES EXPLOIT our people with their empty promises"
1555057721640419,27:27,makhosi nobhatyi,"I think Anc understand people better and they respond, President Ramaphosa even say he canâ€™t feel happy when there is more protests whereas there is people to deliver service said that he will fix"
1555057765432441,28:11,Magda Seguin,I know gentleman but The way the ANC are taking South Africans for idiots is off the charts
1555057773675969,28:19,welton paulse,"Ramaphosa promised to fix a lot of things, but dololo so far, we might as well call him MR FIX IT"

1555058008680819,32:14,Ndim Mavuks,"Being persecuted by a minority, racist and internationally discredited regime is a badge of honour but being persecuted by a democratic state must be hurting to people like McBride"
1555058013393646,32:19,makhosi nobhatyi,"Welton paulse I understand frustration you have Ramaphosa is trying to fix administration system by hearing what really happened how deep it is, what caused these problems, once you have that then"
1555058026914528,32:32,makhosi nobhatyi,You may fix it
1555058036725139,32:42,Magda Seguin,@welton that was a definitive apartheid strategy to keep people enslaved

1555058096315200,33:41,Ndim Mavuks,It is because of people like McBride that we will continue to vote ANC
1555058120579582,34:06,Magda Seguin,@Ndim your words are so significant in the context.Are you a writer?
1555058123577855,34:09,Robert Russell,If Ace gets involved in the Alex housing project... there will only be 900k houses built cause he will take his 10% as per usual.....

1555058240197295,36:05,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks McBride probably doesn't vote for the ANC anymore.
1555058243364614,36:08,welton paulse,"@Magda Seguin, I always hear and see how people talk about APARTHEID, but very few experienced it first hand. I am talking about the Mies And Baas era,"
1555058276610624,36:41,welton paulse,As recent as 2010 my aunt worked on a farm for a wage of R410 per month
1555058297700001,37:02,Magda Seguin,Imagine here state capture succeeding in putting honest people in jail
1555058301751843,37:07,Nelson Musoliwa,Obvious crime syndicates on car hijack; farm killings cash heist etc mushroomed because crime intelligent regime in SA was highly politicized which led o its dysfunctional status..

1555058347877983,37:53,Magda Seguin,@welton it is still happening as we speak

1555058406378365,38:51,Dilip Badal,@welton paulse .. i doubt your allegations .. as we have organisations that oversees workers wage etc.. why was it not reported
1555058410468447,38:56,Musa Bakiti,@Derek Main Comrade McBride killed for ANC .He is for ever ANC on face of earth and heaven
1555058439694895,39:25,welton paulse,"@Magda Seguin , very very true. My grandparents had 6 kids, yet only 1 of the 5 could write and read a bit, because the whites of the time refused to take the kids to a school."

1555058544492579,41:10,makhosi nobhatyi,McBride was been attack by those whom close to the man
1555058589733915,41:55,Louie,"welton paulse , why did the whites have to take them to school. They could have gone mon their own accord."
1555058610716840,42:16,Derek Main,@Musa Bakiti Yes - I know McBride's history well. But he must be very disillusioned with what the ANC has become and the fact that he has an ANC target on his back.
1555058638017525,42:43,Magda Seguin,"Everybody should read the Daily Maverick investigative article The IPID Papers, Death Squads and Covert Units:Nathi Nhleko's hand in state capture"

1555058733488841,44:18,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks Why? You'd have to be a fool to vote ANC after hearing about all their corruption. That's idiotic.
1555058751985405,44:37,veld,"The ANC needs to expunge its demons. But is still the best hope for a stable, just and prosperous SA."

1555058819448708,45:45,Magda Seguin,@welton many do not understand what happens in rural areas and farms..The reclusive nature lends itself to abuse by farmers.Farmworkers are the most marginalised in SA
1555058850207448,46:15,Ndim Mavuks,It is cadres of the ANC that fought against corruption with the state at great personal cost to themselves and their families

1555058867733221,46:33,Thulani Bukani,@Ndim Mavuks you canâ€™t be thinking strait if you still vote ANC after all this. What happened to Makhosi Khoza? Why are people who stand up always so unpopular and choked by their own party?
1555058877097561,46:42,Derek Main,@Musa Bakiti It seems you are fooled easily. No - I'm done with the ANC - I've seen the light. They are a bunch of self-enriching criminals.
1555058878478651,46:44,Desmond Masilela,Very serious matters.

1555058987774038,48:33,veld,"The EFF is compromising itself out of desperation. The DA is an irrevocably right-wing, paternalistic group. The ANC, for all its faults, occupies the only constructive ground for progress."

1555059485302342,56:51,Kevin Simon,Very clear that the DCJ has already digested the detail of Mcbride's evidence. This evidence is going to lead to many more having to submit their versions.
1555059517863060,57:23,Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks Then they're idiots too. Like the service delivery protesters - they'll vote for the very same govt that has failed with service delivery. How stupid is that?
