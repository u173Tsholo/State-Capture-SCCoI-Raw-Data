1551184885820757,30:31,jeevan singh,no sides there.
1551184892471542,30:38,Eugene,I know they are going to release the killer mosquitoes in South of Europe and send them to the north side in 2050 that would actually be the 3rd launch of the killer mosquitoes.
1551184939218639,31:25,Nhlanhla Nsele,so it remains unsaid that this evidence leader has been very clear...very prepared!
1551185048092737,33:13,Michael Leopoldt,8 ta
1551185223678523,36:09,Eugene,The mosquitoes lay egs inside of the human body they can produce like a 100 000 mosquitoes per person. They don't need water like othe mosquitoes to breed
1551185344991509,38:10,Eugene,So if you see someone who died of a killer mosquitoe it's best to leave the body and just run because you might be next

1551187423672176,1:12:49,Derek Main,@Pheladi Lamola The time for playing with these criminals is over. We should do what they do in Saudi Arabia to thieves and chop off a hand
1551187438405810,1:13:04,Eugene,The dumb ones would be highly intelligent compared to the smart people in South Africa.
1551187444115762,1:13:09,rohan barnard,Thanks @Anne M. & @Felix Muyoba

1551187567479137,1:15:13,Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo They will not confirm these allegations - they will lie through their teeth as they always have
1551187623369997,1:16:08,John-Basel Ioannou,"because of koko,molefe and Ngubane eskom his holding the country at ransom"
1551187642839112,1:16:28,Sthakathi Khumalo,v Which make it difficult for me to accept this one version as the truth.. I want people in the field or central to give me evidence/corroborate as opposed to theories

1551187770879338,1:18:36,Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo What do these people testifying against the looters have to gain - nothing. Whereas the looters have every reason to lie
1551187772119444,1:18:37,Christian W,"@Thando Nkutha yes but they decided to become corrupt, they were not forced"
1551187776067171,1:18:41,Anne M.,"@Sthakathi Khumalo The commission investigators have checked all the affidavits, and there are a lot of compromising e-mails between the previous Eskom management."

1551187917134528,1:21:02,John-Basel Ioannou,this adv is giving facts with confirmation

1551188064584846,1:23:30,Michael Michael,Derek correct
1551188097842052,1:24:03,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Thando Nkutha an educated man ruined graduates and destroying them by putting money, look at their career is in mess now, these people sold out our struggle to the few blaming whites ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1551188117239389,1:24:22,Christian W,hopefully the tribunal will speed that up
1551188166604253,1:25:11,Christian W,@makhosi nobhatyi where does the whites come into play here? you are just race baiting
1551188198077868,1:25:43,Andre Gerber,@ Sthakathi Khumalo They cooked the books and lied. Eskom was basically bankrupt since 2015
1551188204732335,1:25:50,makhosi nobhatyi,There is no way we should blame whites we have authority to change South Africa but our leadership were busy enriching themselves ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1551188217555171,1:26:03,Christian W,I agree that they are a embarrassment for black people
1551188237814729,1:26:23,John-Basel Ioannou,"there's another reason y,the guptas pushed up the dollar,export of coal"
1551188258138419,1:26:44,Christian W,black people should be outraged as there people represent them and thus should be shining examples of excellence
1551188293584639,1:27:19,Jane .Blamire,Where do you start to fix this mess???
1551188307869910,1:27:33,Christian W,there are such amazing black people but these corrupt people make their name bad
1551188353218421,1:28:19,Andre Gerber,As a South African I would not say embarrassment foe black people but embarrassment for South Africans
1551188355820454,1:28:21,Pheladi Lamola,We are outraged @Christian W but our voices are not heard because we're not politically connected.
1551188367378963,1:28:32,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Christian w my apologies I was trying to reveal something here these people who are implicated here always come to media criticize whites knowing that they are beneficiaries ,"
1551188389664696,1:28:55,Christian W,What is interesting with watching so many of these inquiries is the body language of people who appear sincere and honest vs those with hidden agendas and who are clearly dishonest
1551188432504514,1:29:38,Christian W,"@Pheladi Lamola I can understand that, but there are voices of reason, they inspired me especially during the zuma must fall"
1551188462397650,1:30:08,Christian W,@makhosi nobhatyi ok
1551188475592757,1:30:21,Jane .Blamire,Yes Christian and notice that the innocent dont refer to their files so much cos they are telling truths
1551188477797516,1:30:23,Derek Main,@Jane .Blamire Another way we can start to fix this mess is to vote wisely in May
1551188484193103,1:30:30,Lwandile Radebe,no wonder Guptas ran away...... they were milking our country.... mara why anc sold us out
1551188523512621,1:31:08,Jane .Blamire,The choices are worrying Derek
1551188541191515,1:31:26,Derek Main,@Lwandile Radebe Because for the ANC it's always been about self-enrichment and stuff the people
1551188547281234,1:31:33,Sthakathi Khumalo,"Andre Gerber I hear you, then what are we doing on this commission if we not gonna find anything.. since the books are manipulated. Because for me, this inquiry then becomes useless.."
1551188553877134,1:31:39,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Thando Nkutha President appointed another arm of investigators to investigate funds we lost, look what these thieves do blames president that is bringing back scorpion coz scared they will be arrestd"
1551188576850833,1:32:02,Andre Gerber,Yes Derek all must think hard before their X
1551188577184134,1:32:02,Singi Mathebula,and they have or will host R100m wedding in Dubai. cry our beloved mzanzi
1551188604751291,1:32:30,Felix Muyoba,@Lwandile Radebe they took us for granted..that we are stupid and we will not detect their deception..they were wrong!!
1551188670178314,1:33:35,Sthakathi Khumalo,"The Eskom saga for me, is just two cooperate indices (clever blacks like Koko vs IPPS).. BOTH THESE INDICES WANT TO MILK STATE MONEY!! IF THEY ARE BOTH FOUND NOT CONSISTENT, THEY MUST ALL BE REMOVED!"
1551188687314710,1:33:52,Christian W,"@Thando Nkutha i read it ""properly"" my interpretation was just out."
1551188698081605,1:34:03,John-Basel Ioannou,so theoretically the guptas caused load shedding
1551188709465559,1:34:15,Felix Muyoba,"@Sthakathi Khumalo how can you call a thief clever, wena?"
1551188726182975,1:34:31,Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo We need IPPs - it's the only way forward
1551188743346477,1:34:48,makhosi nobhatyi,It is Gupta did load shedding
1551188748144040,1:34:53,Anne M.,"@John-Basel Ioannou Yes, and costing this country billions in losses in the process"
1551188772723452,1:35:17,Andre Gerber,Commissions are here to figure out the amount and who is responsible then only the law steps in
1551188779495973,1:35:25,Singi Mathebula,President mudt move fast and arrest these thugs before they remove him at the NGC
1551188786145839,1:35:31,M T,China is already in - Taking over Eskom
1551188831965060,1:36:17,Sthakathi Khumalo,Felix Muyoba- I hear he is a clever black.. and Derek Main 40 year contracts are just capture at its highest points. If they are kept they must be given one year contracts haha
1551188887391056,1:37:13,John-Basel Ioannou,"anne.m I heard for every stage it the equivalent of a billion per stage.eg stage 2 =R2billion,stage 3 =R3billion and so on.Thats per day"
