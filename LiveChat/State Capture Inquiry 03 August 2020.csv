1596442288809643,10:34,Hangwani Phaswana,how much money has he wasted on this commission and for what ? he is looting public funds @Jacqui Baumgardt
1596442295568641,10:40,Bongani Shibambu,this is circus
1596442308498703,10:53,Mangalani Mangalani,Camera lady is insane
1596442315369963,11:00,Dan Brown,"Zondo is too soft on these implicated persons. Government ministers, Police, Hawks etc think they should control if and when they appear. Where are the arrests?"
1596442315923894,11:00,Thulani Bukani,She didn‚Äôt come again? I thought she was told that she should come and state her case why it must be postponed in person.
1596442347417271,11:33,Mangalani Mangalani,She is here I think

1596442506849314,14:10,Singi Mathebula,wa delela nwana loyi.
1596442529099038,14:34,Caroline Hawanga,@Jacqui Baumgardt I agree. She will keep playing hide and seek if DCJ allows this postponement

1596442623599613,16:08,Thulani Bukani,We don‚Äôt care if this could get her impeached. We are talking about state capture here. If it means she must be impeached then so be it.
1596442624446947,16:08,Caroline Hawanga,@Mike Clark I hope she won't get her way today ü§û
1596442633797826,16:19,Gabisile Mabuza,She is a sitting corrupt judge!
1596442648157768,16:33,Dan Brown,"I think Zondo has got the ""Stockholm Syndrome"" where he is a hostage to these Corrupt politicians and people and becoming their buddies."
1596442661318537,16:47,Jacqui Baumgardt,ducking and diving - theat firepool is becoming very useful
1596442676443388,17:01,Jacqui Baumgardt,"Go, Zondo, go!"
1596442686964784,17:10,Luthando Xhamlayo,This lawyer is very poor. I will be surprised if Judge Makhubele doesn't change him too. He can't even put forward a convincing argument
1596442693367623,17:20,Mike Newlands,@Caroline Hawanga I agree if she does she makes a mockery of this commission and the 80 whatever miilions spent. This becomes a circus.
1596442712589375,17:37,Thulani Bukani,Don‚Äôt allow this madness DCJ

1596442838441721,19:43,Musa Mabunda,Oh she's there
1596442863071413,20:08,Thulani Bukani,These politically connected fat cats are so used to bullying the judicial system helped by the ANC. There‚Äôs no space for that here. They think they can talk nonesense and DCJ must be sympathetic.
1596442874361221,20:20,Mike Newlands,So I bet she will not take off her mask if she speaks to hide her shame.
1596442881400340,20:26,Gerda 7,"Cain , I agree"

1596443367241709,28:31,Musa Mabunda,"DCJ Zondo says we can proceed without her affidavit, so it's declined. She will be sworn under oath soon"
1596443371781860,28:36,Gerda 7,Judge Makhubela is a sitting judge and is afraid that she will be impeached.
1596443372039402,28:37,Caroline Hawanga,as she raises her hand I hope it is to say she is ready to start
1596443387119318,28:51,Zamile Hina,"Zondo lets start now, i have to go in 2hrs time"
