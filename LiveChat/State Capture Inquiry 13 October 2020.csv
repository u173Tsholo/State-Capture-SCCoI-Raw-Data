1602582441269079,1:39:54,Kevin Simon,Ngubane does not look like a happy camper. Perhaps he uderstands how he was played.
1602582470596066,1:40:22,Gugulethu Dube,This Ngubane board should be charged with conspiracy to commit corruption with the Guptas
1602582486966925,1:40:38,Sherwin Peters,I bet these ppl think that we believe their hogwash
1602582500553446,1:40:52,Maboko S,Dr Ngubane was a proxy
1602582524119707,1:41:16,Mzalwane Mzala,Ngubane was not played. He went around SOEs enabling state capture.
1602582530644955,1:41:22,Kevin Simon,DC has it absolutely right.
1602582565624074,1:41:57,Gordon Nefdt,Dr Ngubane is IFP or ANC?
1602582588258667,1:42:20,wim louw,@Sherwin Peters I don't think so. I think family watching the stream read our comments.
1602582611849428,1:42:43,Gugulethu Dube,"He is ANC, he left IFP in the early 2000s"
1602582631852735,1:43:04,Thabo Mokoaleli,"Dr. Ben Ngubane was IFP, but later joined ANC🤷"

1602582643872968,1:43:15,Fred Desrosiers,My opinion is that it was him feeding Mr. Howa and Esa what the board was going to decide.
1602582650560763,1:43:22,Gordon Nefdt,Why he left IFP????

1602582834093208,1:46:25,Kevin Simon,19 to 30 March is too long a gap for someone to know😊 Perhaps a time machine. Takes South African politician to debunk Einstein's theory of relativity.
1602582860721112,1:46:51,Fred Desrosiers,they must get Esa before the commission.
