1603272492917994,1:19:26,R.m. B.,I think SARS life-style audits would have been less costly than this commission (but probably less entertaining).
1603272511512810,1:19:45,Sheperd Moyo,The ANC is coming to government didnt have an idea of how to run the economy but stealing otherwise our GDP at this sage supposed not be 80%

1603272949387158,1:27:03,BanditZA,How about a reduction of ANC power which will birth an era of coalition politics? Power distributed seems better but consensus is also hard to reach — could stall
