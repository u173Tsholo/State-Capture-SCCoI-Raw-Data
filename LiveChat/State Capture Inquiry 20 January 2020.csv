1579509616421271,36:35,Nkululeko Zondo,"I wonder what will our Leaders say in Davos about the state of Power to the investors, on the other hand Eskom should not be allowed to increase tariffs. We cannot be crucified for their failures"

1579510775242594,55:54,Kung Fu Kenny,@Yumna Thomas Hope Malema is next for prosecution and extreme racism.
1579510784041603,56:03,Antoinette Meyer,"haibo then Jacob comes with his 5 or 6 suitcases, big ones, and brings the money back to the commission"
1579510788427637,56:07,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Stronger together Nothing new, sadly."
1579510869650204,57:29,Yumna Thomas,Malema and Eff fighting atleast unlike others just there to breath.. its becoz of EFF that zuma is a lost soul
1579510876442796,57:35,Antoinette Meyer,I think MO Shaik will help find the 98%
1579510937971480,58:37,Kung Fu Kenny,@Yumna Thomas Fighting for what? they already looted VBS. They are fighting to loot more.
1579510955648986,58:54,Kung Fu Kenny,@Yumna Thomas It's because of DA/FF+ ect that Zuma is in his current situation. ANC/EFF protect him.
1579510957969892,58:57,Yumna Thomas,after zuma destroyed S.A... pathetic
1579510981864704,59:20,Kung Fu Kenny,@Yumna Thomas EFF will be worse than Zuma if they are ever in control.
1579511010570403,59:49,Kung Fu Kenny,Ramapoes=Zuma's right hand man

1579511041534023,1:00:21,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Yumna Thomas I can see you don't look at their alliances. EFF is still part of the ANC, just a far left,marxist militant wing."
1579511073067514,1:00:51,Yumna Thomas,give people credit it's not easy to fight these structures
1579511097229349,1:01:16,Kung Fu Kenny,@Stronger together A few weeks ago i saw interviews like that about South Africa as well. South Africa will be worse than Zim.
1579511131078475,1:01:50,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Yumna Thomas Yes it is, if they used the law like it's supposed to then these criminals would already be in jail. Corruption rules South Africa so they won't be in jail anytime soon."
1579511146791031,1:02:06,Kung Fu Kenny,@Yumna Thomas Afriforum literally has to pressure the NPA just to do their job.
1579511187815475,1:02:46,Kung Fu Kenny,@Stronger together The rest of the world knows what's going on in South Africa but turns a blind eye.
1579511204404491,1:03:03,Kung Fu Kenny,You can't fool all the people all the time.
1579511223996323,1:03:22,Endinako Projects,Kenny u sound like you read the opposite of what is written or told in our daily news
1579511284025082,1:04:22,Kung Fu Kenny,@Endinako Projects Do you believe what you read or hear from our Corrupted news sources of South Africa? proof is within the courts. Time to jail the looters and EFF VBS looters.
1579511299391890,1:04:37,Yumna Thomas,@Edinako so true
1579511319048205,1:04:58,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Stronger together I know about him, traveling a long distance on foot to spread awareness"
1579511383810057,1:06:02,Kung Fu Kenny,@Stronger together Pan Africanism is even within our politics in written word now lol.

1579511578887525,1:09:17,–û–¥–∏–Ω–æ–∫–∏–π –≤–æ–ª–∫,@Wilson... only one centre of power . Luthuli House. The rest is window dressing
1579511588275643,1:09:26,Kung Fu Kenny,@Yumna Thomas it's well documented. Xhosa and Zulu's killed our Indigenous Khoisan to near extinction. Then they sold their very own people as slaves to the Brits to sell to the U.S
1579511620947359,1:09:59,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Stronger together Desmond Tutu said that himself. He said ""Black people lived better during apartheid than they do now in"""
1579511626663057,1:10:07,Robert Russell,Madam...facts are facts... lies are lies..... how do you change the facts???????
1579511673710943,1:10:53,Elvis Malakoane,this lady seem to not get it
1579511681309310,1:11:00,Robert Russell,it makes no difference when the truth is told...... Oh yes.... I forgot... you tell lies on behalf of your clients

1579511703676568,1:11:22,Kung Fu Kenny,This lady talks with Emotions not with her Educational Background.

1579511771444698,1:12:30,Elvis Malakoane,she like her voice this lady
1579511800425902,1:12:59,Thabani Mkhatshwa,Mr n Mrs Shabalala accused of corruption at the Treasury
1579511839049771,1:13:38,Tebogo Khaas,Advocate Shezi is arguing a lost application. Wasting commission's time. Testing Zondo's patience..
1579511845633495,1:13:44,Wilson Hishono,"@Stronger together it was even in Namibia ...old people have/owned/acquired houses bt after demcracy /Indpndence sudenly prices skyrocketed, land isues emerged its somer very difficult"
1579511863912825,1:14:02,Lucky Thwala,who she representing
1579511867772660,1:14:05,Wilson Hishono,now for a graduate to acquire both a proper house and proper car while in a democracy or independent is close to imposible
1579511870421553,1:14:08,Andre Ackerman,"Lies, more lies, deceit, 2 minds working, but not in tandem. The ANC, is only using some blacks, as cannon fodder,manipulating raw emotions, regrettably, these people allowed it, and still is!!."
1579511882324385,1:14:21,Kung Fu Kenny,@Wilson Hishono Land Issues happen because black people in South Africa reproduce 60 000 Children per year. That's called over population.
1579511920183963,1:14:58,Kung Fu Kenny,@Wilson Hishono Especially those in poverty are hit harder after reproduction
1579511942013602,1:15:21,Yumna Thomas,this lady
1579511948783900,1:15:27,Robert Russell,3 MINUTES
1579511949036591,1:15:28,Immanuel,"im glad she is not my lawyer, what is she raving about, anybody know‚úã?"
1579511957286808,1:15:36,Wilson Hishono,@Kung Fu Kenny well reproducing is fine but equal distirbution of resources is the issue
1579511957566940,1:15:37,Elvis Malakoane,kung fu Kenny you are persistent about black population growth and you are insulting us
1579511958927940,1:15:38,fuzile dazana,how is this
1579511999894982,1:16:19,Yumna Thomas,she is a junior
1579512003586232,1:16:22,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Wilson Hishono Reproduction isn't ""Fine"". On the scale of 60 000 per year (Statistics from HomeAffairs) it's called OverPopulation. With over population less jobs,money,food."
1579512009286718,1:16:27,Nkululeko Mdluli,"But to be honest this lady has got a point,it is highly likely that people won,t be charged."
1579512016505060,1:16:35,Pastor J.J,If she was my wife I would have killed myself a while back.
1579512023089994,1:16:42,Immanuel,"she is lecturing the judge on aspects of law and procedure, really now?"
1579512023785343,1:16:42,Kung Fu Kenny,@Elvis Malakoane This is not an insult it's a fact. Growing 60 000 per year for a single race is over population especially in South Africa.
1579512048662161,1:17:09,Wilson Hishono,Race does not matter we talking about humanity here
1579512074532723,1:17:33,Kung Fu Kenny,@Wilson Hishono We're talking about South Africa and the real facts. Over population is the big problem when they have NO JOBS.
1579512094892481,1:17:54,Tebogo Khaas,Application dismissed. Rightly so.
1579512100842818,1:18:00,Tulonga Henoch,Dismissed...after all that long talk

1579512166633090,1:19:05,Yumna Thomas,dismissed I'm not supriced
1579512168934261,1:19:08,Tebogo Khaas,The commission of adjournments is on a sudden tea break.
1579512175791904,1:19:14,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Wilson Hishono No, It's about Overpopulation and overpopulation is why Resources run depleted."
1579512192538488,1:19:31,Wilson Hishono,@fuzile dazana HE is consulting i think
1579512227643396,1:20:06,Wilson Hishono,there is not @Kung Fu Kenny south africa is not overpopulated
1579512232854682,1:20:12,Elvis Malakoane,it is about race and I am not buying a racist undertone of population nonsense it just a cover up to be arrogant
1579512233633094,1:20:13,Sboniso Sabelo,I wish I can see people like Julius Malema coming into this commission there's a lot we can hear
1579512248070002,1:20:27,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Wilson Hishono Go look at any over populated country. Poverty sits with those who create the most children on a yearly basis. When it comes to property, pay for it like the rest of us."
1579512257157893,1:20:36,Wilson Hishono,go to Nigeria @Kung Fu Kenny youll know what overpopulation is
1579512305241687,1:21:24,Kung Fu Kenny,@Wilson Hishono The same thing is going to happen in South Africa in a few years anyways. The rate of black/colored reproduction South Africa is very close to over population.
1579512308645866,1:21:26,Yumna Thomas,@Sabelo me too
1579512315568294,1:21:34,Ayanda Diliza,There is nothing excessive about South Africa's population growth rate. The problem is a lack of economic growth and infrastructure development to accommodate the growing population.
1579512321161603,1:21:41,Kung Fu Kenny,@Stronger together They make more and more children to abuse the Grant System.
1579512331112968,1:21:50,Kevin,Kung Fu China has close to 2 Billion people with very few people not working. Those who do not work in China choose to do so. So why should that be a problem in SA
1579512332178573,1:21:51,Pastor J.J,@Elvis Malakoane ...Totally agree. It is becoming an unnecassary irritation and has nothing to do with the matter at hand.
1579512350629688,1:22:10,Wilson Hishono,@Ayanda Diliza THANK YOU
1579512371706988,1:22:31,Kung Fu Kenny,@Ayanda Diliza It's called over population. Go look at the symptoms of a over populated country. Everything you mentioned falls under Overpopulation.
1579512398164739,1:22:56,Kung Fu Kenny,@Ayanda Diliza How can you expect a country to grow when you elect the biggest criminals that loot the country in ANC/EFF?
1579512404896066,1:23:04,Kevin,If the country provides the environment for job creation...then there are jobs...easy as that
1579512409606690,1:23:08,Elvis Malakoane,pastor j true pastor and I don't like racist cheap talks because they end up polarising
1579512441423240,1:23:41,Kung Fu Kenny,Medical Marijuana can provide BILLIONS of Jobs. They want black people to stay poor and full of hate to use them for political Gain.
1579512457993145,1:23:57,Theresa Smuts,"As an imminent departure awaits Rh negA,B-JESUS(HORUS)-üòáÔ∏è-Cauc Asian,over next 50 yrs,worlds population will be 125 Billion by 2060 egNigeria,Congi,Egypt,Tanzania...cannibalusm will increase."
1579512476901114,1:24:16,Kung Fu Kenny,@Stronger together That's awesome üëç
1579512523915967,1:25:01,Kung Fu Kenny,@Stronger together Not at the moment but i can make a account
1579512525780234,1:25:03,Ayanda Diliza,In South Africa population growth are inversely related. During poor economic growth unemployment rises and the poor resort to having more babies to get government grants.
1579512530650100,1:25:09,Theresa Smuts,KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!
1579512571532069,1:25:50,Kevin,"There is a huge problem on the way ... It's called MOTHER NATURE. She always finds a way to ""re-calibrate"" and ""adjust"""
1579512607066757,1:26:26,Elvis Malakoane,No nation has monopoly of knowledge all people have knowledge just others are using their small brains to make rude opinions
1579512662737258,1:27:22,Andre Ackerman,"For how long is this ""Wharra, wharra"""" is going to end before, Christmas??"
1579512678551511,1:27:36,Kung Fu Kenny,@Stronger together Have you seen previously expropriated farms are at a rate of 88% Non working and producing nothing.
1579512702408655,1:28:00,Kevin,"There will be the mother of all ""super viruses"" one day to bring the balance back to nature...."
1579512775138807,1:29:14,Andre Ackerman,"So, it is not about land, but money???"
1579512786238033,1:29:25,Ayanda Diliza,The problem is not the principle of land re-distribution; but its poor and sometimes senseless implementation.
1579512829669542,1:30:08,Gareth Hellyar,S.A. like Zim in five years time. Wait and see.

1579513126945002,1:35:06,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Ayanda Diliza They already tried it, and it failed horribly. There was a form of EWC in the early 2000's and those farms aren't producing anything. 88% produce nothing of those farms that were taken"
1579513140391960,1:35:19,Elvis Malakoane,I am not goner get back in this back and forth Whatever keep your boat afloat
1579513202151279,1:36:20,Kung Fu Kenny,@johannes mailula Takes nearly 2 Million rand Per child to send them through school to grade 12 alone. People have no Common sense anymore.

1579513300604872,1:38:00,johannes mailula,the problem is we got back the land and we dont have money to buy equipment so what is the purpose for that whites are running the economy like or not
1579513309099391,1:38:08,Kung Fu Kenny,@Elvis Malakoane You do realize the current BEE law is racist towards all other races right?
1579513368057484,1:39:06,Elvis Malakoane,Kung fu kenny BEE is just a mess because even ordinary black people do not benefit
1579513386450126,1:39:25,Kung Fu Kenny,@Elvis Malakoane BEE is a racist law.
1579513396992338,1:39:35,Kung Fu Kenny,@Elvis Malakoane You should not earn more because of skin color.

1579513527786050,1:41:47,Elvis Malakoane,Robert Russell true BEE has been highjaked by politicians and cronies
1579513557182288,1:42:16,Gareth Hellyar,I dont think he likes her.
1579513557908627,1:42:16,Pamela Sue,"LoL Vuyani Peter, took the words out of my mouth. Sefikile uMabena"
1579513564992935,1:42:24,Ayanda Diliza,@Kung Fu Kenny BEE is not a racist law. Racist laws are made on the principle of exclusion. BEE laws are based on the principle of inclusion of the previously excluded.
1579513565293308,1:42:25,Thulani Bukani,This lady annoys me a little
1579513565860158,1:42:25,Jacqui Baumgardt,BEE should be called BFF - best friends forever
1579513571994036,1:42:32,Kung Fu Kenny,@Stronger together Our current problem is corruption and looting. The family members of politicians and friends. Have you seen Eskom has 60% more people working there than they need?
1579513581458352,1:42:40,Kung Fu Kenny,@Ayanda Diliza BEE is a racist Law. It's racist towards any other race.
1579513593911418,1:42:52,Kevin,She also annoys Zondo üòÇ

1579513843030891,1:47:02,David Tuer,Pamela Sue- No he has not.
1579513883632774,1:47:42,Kung Fu Kenny,@Elvis Malakoane BEE is the reason SOE's are failing. Including Eskom and SAA.
1579513906890394,1:48:05,Granny Mokwena,advocate Wentzel is very disorganised
1579513909292271,1:48:08,Jacqui Baumgardt,Business execs must run SOEs not cadres

1579513969637107,1:49:08,Kung Fu Kenny,@Makwa Choma Slow Motion? Inflation is at 7.5 and our GDP growth at 3.0. South Africa is going down fast.
1579513990985865,1:49:29,Kung Fu Kenny,The Rand in 2020 is the worst performing currency thanks to looting and corruption.

1579514176557055,1:52:36,Kung Fu Kenny,@Stronger together I agree. They loot instead of spending it on their own people for housing and food/plumbing. They do this in many other countries when they want to eliminate a Ethnicity.
1579514212010825,1:53:10,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Makwa Choma ok, elaborate."
1579514234323027,1:53:34,Kung Fu Kenny,"@Makwa Choma We will never be able to remove them, The second wing of the ANC is EFF."
