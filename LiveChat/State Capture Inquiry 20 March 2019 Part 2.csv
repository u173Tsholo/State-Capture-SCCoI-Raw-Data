1553086476281427,39:34,M T,"What package / golden handshake did he receive, if any?"

1553086645115128,42:23,Magda Seguin,I have come to the conclusion that most commenters on this forum never read anything that is already in the public domain about state capture...they comment as if everyone here is a crook

1553086974441652,47:52,Born free,Very true because Zuma has no intelligence .So his ministers and comrades did as Zuma did.

1553087434211183,55:32,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi What I am saying is that there are many others who are just as corrupt as Zuma who are still in government.
1553087452900021,55:50,Born free,They were Terrorists trained by the communist Cubans and Russia
1553087474386829,56:12,Magda Seguin,The PMFA already showed that VR Laser was a shelf company so Stefan Burger is looking for a scapegoat
1553087487763051,56:25,Derek Main,@Val Speirs One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter.

1553087861932371,1:02:39,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi At least you're no longer saying it was just Zuma. The problem is that the ANC has so many corrupt individuals that they have tainted the entire party.

1553089515665840,1:30:13,Ntombethemba Manase,My bad.I can see now that she did not mean it when she said the new board must not interfere with the work of the executive.
1553089549203387,1:30:46,nicci wessels,Why don‚Äôt they just say that Brown interfered???
1553089561919863,1:30:59,Michael Michael,Desmond it seems they will be sitting on Fridy

1553089663232387,1:32:40,Michael Michael,Felix they are capable of doing that.
1553089678424120,1:32:56,Magda Seguin,"Gigabavis in trouble with the Gupta naturalisation,he has a lot to answer for"
1553089700827543,1:33:18,Derek Main,@Desmond Masilela I'm afraid you might be right.
1553089751009315,1:34:08,Magda Seguin,Koko is very active on Twitter...he is blaming everyone but himself
1553089777288315,1:34:35,Desmond Masilela,@Derek Main. Jail is made for me and you. If you dont have money you straight to jail. But if you have money they find you guilty and you have fine to pay.
1553089789605400,1:34:47,Derek Main,@Magda Seguin No surprises there - Koko has shown himself to be a bold-faced liar.
1553089814256157,1:35:12,Desmond Masilela,you go straight to jail
1553089824167187,1:35:22,Derek Main,@Desmond Masilela Too true - justice is for the rich.

1553089895176420,1:36:33,Desmond Masilela,@Derek Main. So this is just a waste of time. If its true something might happen. Why cant they start charging this ppl that are implicated.
1553089954034001,1:37:32,Desmond Masilela,You become a suspect of killing someone they come and take you put in you in jail until you become clear. What is the different between this implicated once.
1553089973304101,1:37:51,Derek Main,@Desmond Masilela Not sure why - I suppose they need to un-capture the NPA first.
1553090004225157,1:38:22,Desmond Masilela,Let them start with the process of filling court papers let the court start to do with its duty.
1553090116045953,1:40:14,Desmond Masilela,@Derek Main. For almost 10yrs we heard about Guptas. No one has taken action against them.
1553090157650626,1:40:55,Michael Michael,no
1553090201028570,1:41:38,Desmond Masilela,The Guptas did not use any Airport to leave SA. They used OR tambo. Why didnt they stop them from leaving SA? because they where under investigation.
1553090248264265,1:42:26,Desmond Masilela,@Thando Nkutha. The chair ask for short break untill 16:00pm should be back soon.

1553090327811671,1:43:46,Desmond Masilela,@Thando Nkutha. You welcome.

1553092378316455,2:17:56,Magda Seguin,What he is explaining is what is defined in the World Bank 2001 State Capture document..
1553092417302921,2:18:34,Magda Seguin,State Capture didn't start in South Africa it is a global political phenomena
1553092498021263,2:19:55,Richardt Human,Magda Seguin absolutely
1553092571341938,2:21:09,Derek Main,@Magda Seguin Zuma and the ANC just perfected it.

1553093436630214,2:35:34,Magda Seguin,I understand @Robert Russell it was a free for all...state capture anarchy
1553093618479990,2:38:36,Magda Seguin,Sloppiness in their criminality
1553093619466792,2:38:37,Robert Russell,Without a doubt...makes one sick to see where we have landed up.... and the scary thing is that we are going to land up with ANOTHER 5 years of ANC acceptance of this behavior.. normalized by the ANC
1553093696772891,2:39:54,Magda Seguin,We may end up with a coalition government
1553093731462654,2:40:29,Robert Russell,He was debarred ..... goes to show who Zuma keeps as company now doesn't it ?

1553094033871241,2:45:31,Magda Seguin,At national level a coalition may work...we had a national coalition government before
1553094077867290,2:46:15,Magda Seguin,I doubt that the ANC will be completely out...too many diehard voters
1553094094256098,2:46:32,Lungisani Ntshonga,I don‚Äôt know where my X should I vote for
1553094132955777,2:47:10,Diana Sekatane,The problem is most of the voters are not that much aware of what their beloved organization is doing.
1553094203111086,2:48:20,Magda Seguin,The ANC destroyed the country...future generations will judge us harshly

1553094378764492,2:51:16,Magda Seguin,The DA need ethical guidelines...we never know what they are planning inhouse
1553094412951990,2:51:50,Ben Cole,"Not judge ""us"". But those who perpetrated the unholy injustices pertaining to the state capture crime."
1553094458609712,2:52:36,Magda Seguin,True @Ben ....I was referring to the historical perspective
1553094523475306,2:53:41,Magda Seguin,In some countries the streets would have been full of dissent but we have become numb with trauma
1553094531916994,2:53:49,Mogwape Mogwape,"ANC think we owe them, we owe them nothing."
1553094619274764,2:55:17,Magda Seguin,"The ANC and EFF always blame colonialism,Western imperialism etc but never do introspection"
1553094728955765,2:57:06,Magda Seguin,This commission is at least giving some a chance to vent and relate their experiences.Judge Zondo's report will have to be concise and lead to arrests
1553094860795999,2:59:18,Andre Gerber,Still wonder who the new whistle-blower is. Can't wait for her day here
1553095160357481,3:04:18,Magda Seguin,Lyn Brown promised him another 5 year contract then fired him....disgusting
1553095223921253,3:05:21,Richardt Human,"The promise was made on the Friday in London, Monday back in the office in Centurion and suspended."
1553095244682774,3:05:42,Richardt Human,She was manipulated seriously.
1553095249238392,3:05:46,Magda Seguin,She has no moral compass
1553095324876073,3:07:02,Richardt Human,"Stay at home, go and play golf"
1553095340893840,3:07:18,Diana Sekatane,That is the work of a shadow state to place stodges at strategic places so as to loot and enrich themselves and their cronies.
1553095400654302,3:08:18,Michael Molome,These shenanigans haven‚Äôt stopped as a culture of living by friends the loot has taken over lives of Mzansi folks
1553095401506359,3:08:19,Magda Seguin,His contract was already over in any case
1553095441139660,3:08:59,Magda Seguin,@Michael it runs very deep at all levels in government
1553095506935111,3:10:04,Diana Sekatane,They don't care about the so called ' our people'.
1553095533757912,3:10:31,Magda Seguin,Batho Pale my foot

1553095672583729,3:12:50,Mongezi Mati,this storyis very painful
1553095699016539,3:13:17,Richardt Human,This guy was a CEO. He had no guts to stand up for himself and now come to the commission to complain that the was treated unfairly.
1553095738138882,3:13:56,Magda Seguin,It is so painful but the heartless ANC will deny they did anything wrong...just watch how arrogant they are in parliament
1553095806242471,3:15:04,Anne M.,@Planeless Pilot He took them to the CCMA
1553095881078259,3:16:20,Diana Sekatane,They are pulling the wool out of the eyes of those who follow them. Taking advantage of the poor people who just believe what ever lies and promises for 25 years.
1553095894921628,3:16:32,Magda Seguin,The CCMA outcome was not favourable...it should have gone to the Labour court or even civil court
1553095956083124,3:17:34,Sipho,Bad
1553095958725412,3:17:37,Anne M.,@Magda Seguin Planeless Pilot said he had no guts - and I responded with CCMA
1553095962914855,3:17:40,Magda Seguin,All these people need debriefing and counselling with reparations
1553096017141855,3:18:34,Magda Seguin,Planeless Pilot has no humanity or compassion
1553096159093899,3:20:57,Ben Cole,"Nothing is likely to come from the ""me too"" call up. It's admirable. But there is just too much dragging us down. As a South African, I hang my head in such utter shame."

1553096244207886,3:22:21,Andre Gerber,Brainless Piloot
1553096264725326,3:22:42,Magda Seguin,I think so too @Ben right now people are blaming Gordhan and the Eskom CEO for load shedding forgetting the huge damage Zuma and the Guptas did
1553096453910424,3:25:51,Ben Cole,Shed a tear for this witness
1553096499598407,3:26:37,Anne M.,Bye all - until Friday
