1574069118711466,1:25:31,Mbulelo Maquba,ramaposa is not corrupt
1574069168307156,1:26:20,Sthakathi Khumalo,The only problem Zuma did was to work against white capital.. look at Dudu Myeni right now. She is being blamed for things done by Colemen Andrews at SAA

1574069239554249,1:27:32,PETER STAFFEN,Sthakathi Khumalo now were did you read this rubbish
1574069259459504,1:27:52,Christiaan du Plessis,Zuma used white capital as a smoke screen to steal money from the poor to enrich himself and his cronies. And some people praised him.
1574069320558100,1:28:53,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Sthakathi Khumalo with all respect but you are not making any sense now, Dudu was in charge there, evidence was placed b4 this commission that she was reckless"
1574069339432450,1:29:12,Sthakathi Khumalo,Go google Bain and Coleman Andrews!!
1574069387764075,1:30:00,Sthakathi Khumalo,Go look at Hawks dossiers clearing Dudu and stop looking at certain media narratives and taking them as facts
1574069457927698,1:31:11,Christiaan du Plessis,Sthakathi then why does Dudu not come testify at the commission if she is innocent? She is hiding
1574069475464111,1:31:28,PETER STAFFEN,Sthakathi Khumalo now how did you get hold of the HAWKS files
1574069566771682,1:33:00,Ntusa Kassange,"Corruption has no colour, but proteges."
1574069620981749,1:33:53,TAF,v
1574069664449016,1:34:37,Ntusa Kassange,what is happening here is not fight against corruption but showing that certain people should not be corrupt only those who really have the power.
1574069765733929,1:36:18,Ntusa Kassange,yes those are the ones that should be prosecuted too
1574069821699115,1:37:15,Sthakathi Khumalo,Peter Staffen Just go and read. SAA owns c. 9 planes & lease 60 planes! dossier clears Dudu Myeni & directly implicates former SAA’s American turn around strategist Coleman Andrews
1574069846324411,1:37:39,Thato Nkadimeng,implicating states
1574069947550143,1:39:20,PETER STAFFEN,"Sthakathi Khumalo and somebody is getting rich on the leases that were signed , this is one of the reasons she does not want to go to court or come here"
1574069961426179,1:39:34,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Sthakathi Khumalo remember Hawks you are taking about was captured, was Zuma play ground so don’t tell us about that,"
1574069982953719,1:39:56,Ntusa Kassange,example many business owners and in SA are involved in Criminal tax avoidance this is what im talking about
1574070004645802,1:40:17,PETER STAFFEN,makhosi nobhatyi well said
1574070040420305,1:40:53,Sthakathi Khumalo,Peter Staffen Who is getting richer??
1574070053739359,1:41:06,Mzalwane Mzala,@Sthakathi Khumalo Only one dodgy publication published about that dossier in 2018. There is no such dossier.
1574070090172953,1:41:43,Sthakathi Khumalo,makhosi nobhatyi Funny enough same investigation was done by a French investigating body which investigated competition and corruption in the airline industry. Thats where the evidence came from
1574070125934612,1:42:19,Mzalwane Mzala,@makhosi nobhatyi Hawks did not release such a dosier.
1574070164578864,1:42:58,PETER STAFFEN,Sthakathi Khumalo please use the brain cell you have got
1574070166486688,1:42:59,Lehlogonolo Seoketse,I like how the witness refers to the guptas as criminals

1574071013691353,1:57:06,David Tuer,I fail to see why Peter Hain is explaining to the commission how State Capture worked and who was responsible. He has said that he has gleaned his knowledge from public sources. There is nothing new.
