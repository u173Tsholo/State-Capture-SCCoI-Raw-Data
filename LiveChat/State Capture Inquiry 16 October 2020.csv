1602835616896507,6:07,Tommygun,Its pretty slack that you can spend millions on the commision and lawyers and cant get a decent microphone set up on the witness. Do they send someone to the witnes to ensure they are set up properly?
1602835679577532,7:10,Douglas Masuku,who is MAAKWANAZI?

1602836048549161,13:18,Fred Desrosiers,they are using Skype
1602836049330699,13:19,Thandekile Sigwela,This is going creat a bad precedent of wanting to testify on Zoom.
1602836069317468,13:39,Owen Nyilika,This Madala mkhwanazi is old enough to control by junior guy like Mr gigaba
1602836081391388,13:50,Heather Durr,Have I died and gone to heaven
1602836109859815,14:20,Fred Desrosiers,the camera issue is on his side

1602836197889020,15:47,Sherwin Peters,The witness doesn't look ill or incapacitated. why's he testifying via crappy video link?
1602836216863171,16:06,Tommygun,Sounds like Barbara Hogan got superceded early by Gigaba who came into Transnet and throwing his weight around
1602836225335027,16:15,Heather Durr,"@Pastor J.J Thanks, my contacts have a hangover as Saint Peter came to visit"
1602836246002673,16:35,Owen Nyilika,@Sherwin Peters is over 60 yrs this madala
1602836252036896,16:42,Fred Desrosiers,"@Sherwin Peters, he could be hidding from authorities"
1602836289556184,17:19,Pastor J.J,@Heather Durr Just got a Whatsapp response. They dont see you there but will check with the guys next door....What di you do wrong Dear Heather?
1602836323458142,17:53,Willie Makena,sound and picture very bad

1602836373715194,18:43,Russia Magezi,Picture of the witness left much to be desired
1602836375783187,18:45,Manelisi mnguni,Any shots fired in SENEKAL
1602836400329002,19:10,Sherwin Peters,Maybe also trying to avoid the DCJ's upcoming questions face to face
1602836415436274,19:25,BanditZA,@SABC PLEASE FIX BAD SOUND ENGINEERING ON ZOOM CALLS. FIX YOUR LEVELS
1602836512820351,21:02,Blake Yogi,Hope you confess as much as you are reading
1602836601854007,22:32,Samuel Skosana,SABC Please let this madala move out of the sunlight as we cannot see his face
1602836623114119,22:54,Heather Durr,Dear All I am 3 months off 60 but still feel 16 so no jokes about old folks please except where strictly necessary-Must I leave the Group now as I am too old😭
1602836639191329,23:10,Mongato Johannes Tshimole,SABC Quality of sound picture are as result of non payments of TV licences to SABC!!!
1602836678381366,23:48,Teunis van Ree,@Heather Durr I beat you hands down😂😂😂
1602836683052328,23:53,Tommygun,I this guy trying to legitimise Mr Gama getting his job back?

1602836713021642,24:23,Lennon Marks,"Heather, I always thought you were still sweet 16"
1602836732191689,24:43,SanFran Arnold,@Tommygun not only that but the contract Gama signed for 80mil to his friend Nyanda
1602836756189476,25:05,Ntsikelelo Vani,hello and bye cause SABC is showing us Nigerian movies on Zond Com
1602836774162554,25:25,GB,@Tommygun - he will very quickly brought up short. Evidence leader wastes no time...it seems
1602836782070096,25:32,Paul Buchel,"@Heather Durr​, Lots of ballies here heather, I'll be 60 in early January."
1602836782171873,25:32,cassim suleman,@heather.dont be so sensitive
1602836786325742,25:36,Pheladi Lamola,Don't leave the group @Heather Durr. We need your wisdom amongst us.
1602836791430578,25:41,Tommygun,Is he the guy who suggested condonations in the first place ?
1602836799365485,25:50,Heather Durr,@Lennon Marks Awww I still think I am 16.But sweet not so much..
1602836800508702,25:51,Niek Cape Town,"Heather, I also beat you with a number of years"
1602836812420923,26:03,Shane Ambrosio,Typical SABC - instead of tapping directly into the zoom feed (or pc) prefer to put the camera on to the projection screen and a mic at the speakers. Amateurs
1602836843005797,26:32,SanFran Arnold,@Tommygun condonation was only asked about 2 months after litigation. They needed explanation as to what condonation is
1602836852128390,26:43,GB,yes @Tommygun - he was pivotal in the whole debacle
1602836857104513,26:46,Brian Hayes,another mamphara this one
1602836868701481,26:58,Tommygun,"@SanFran Arnold Oh ja, I remember 🙂 ta"
1602836893047186,27:23,SanFran Arnold,@Tommygun always a pleasure
1602836915943606,27:45,Pheladi Lamola,@Shane Ambrosio 😂😂😂 Why are you killing me so early in the morning 🤣🤣
1602836931731368,28:03,Shane Ambrosio,lol
1602836965691487,28:35,Jenny Whitewaves,it's awful when you look in the mirror and wonder who the old woman looking back at you is
1602836968901687,28:38,Heather Durr,@Pheladi Lamola You are too kind. Thank you.
1602837053992297,30:03,Heather Durr,@Jenny Whitewaves I always pretended that was my mother who looks just like me until my psychiatrist changed my Bi-Polar meds
1602837091218621,30:40,SanFran Arnold,@Heather Durr 😅😅😅 thats classic
1602837092426429,30:42,Tommygun,I wonder how he will explain ignoring all legal advice he was given contradicting what the board actualy did.
1602837115518983,31:05,Tommygun,why discipline if you condone?
1602837135500863,31:25,Person of interest,When your kids are grey is when you realise that you're getting on a bit!
1602837139316157,31:29,Lennon Marks,"Girls you are funny, let's talk curves I,s.o. age"
1602837141982702,31:32,Tay,This mampara is already hiding?

1602837220613992,32:52,Tommygun,@Fred Desrosiers Just 1 and a bit....
1602837239765667,33:09,SanFran Arnold,"@Person of interest hi there, yes I love his work"
1602837254800013,33:25,Lynn Barnard,hi SanFranArnold
1602837306173346,34:17,Tay,This liar is bubbly hey

1602837386943930,35:36,SanFran Arnold,how can you say they were consistent ?????
1602837422877308,36:11,Henk van Anraad,Not one of the implicated person has spoken the truth.
1602837430322135,36:20,Person of interest,I learn from you @SanFran 🙏🏾
1602837485413941,37:16,Tommygun,"similar issues, other matters, this & that. Very few specifics ever."
1602837496091649,37:26,SanFran Arnold,"@Person of interest you too kind, hehehe😚"
1602837499579940,37:30,Person of interest,No consistency here...
1602837515900026,37:46,Heather Durr,"He, another right hand joins us today"
1602837601936174,39:11,Tommygun,but was Gama not nailed on 4 major transgressions? Only the one coould possibly have been affected by the condonation
1602837628993235,39:39,SanFran Arnold,@Tommygun correct
1602837660747228,40:10,Person of interest,was Gama there with Ramos?
1602837669238296,40:20,Mduduzi Thabede,You’re correct @Tommy...
1602837695701569,40:46,Xolani J Masemula,"Looks like he's excuse is just gonna be, he delegated the condonation,"
1602837777386716,42:07,R.m. B.,"According to yesterday’s testimony, the Board didn’t even know what “Condenation” meant!"
1602837807950233,42:38,Mzalwane Mzala,"Montana vows to reveal all about Prasa at state capture inquiry, but wants Zondo to step down. (Timeslive)"

1602837867353625,43:38,Anne M.,"Oh my word, this was bound to happen. The term ""as thick as thieves"" applies here @Mzalwane Mzala"
1602837880125073,43:50,Lennon Marks,maybe these execs should have applied for condemnation I.s.o. condonation
1602837955764781,45:05,R.m. B.,@Lennon Marks 😆
1602837955904093,45:05,Heather Durr,'On the one hand but on the other hand'
1602837957331931,45:06,Samuel Skosana,Agreed Lennon
1602837968148386,45:17,Tommygun,COndonation sounds like a Nick Linnell suggestion
1602837984131318,45:33,Paul Buchel,There's condensation on his camera lens.
1602838006061502,45:56,R.m. B.,Should be Condomnation...
1602838008845715,45:59,Tommygun,@Paul Buchel hope its sweat

1602838051106258,46:40,Person of interest,But he's getting shiny now be?
1602838057891643,46:48,Samuel Skosana,"Chair, please stop this Zoom thing"

1602838094108891,47:23,Tommygun,ITs all old school deference and patronage.
1602838094963590,47:24,thando nicky,we need to see the emtions live when they grilled

1602838522982591,54:33,R.m. B.,Has Gama been summons to the Commission?
1602838526951398,54:36,Mzalwane Mzala,Education does not necessarily make one ethical. I have seen highly educated people 'chewing water' in this commission because of unethical behaviour.

1602838707157354,57:37,SanFran Arnold,"@R.m. B. yeah, he probably can link Zuma, but its highly unlikely that he will give up no.1"
1602838711435456,57:40,Tommygun,but there was Sympathy for him 🙂 for some odd reason.
1602838744972784,58:15,SanFran Arnold,"No sir, just say it, Gigabyte told me to do it, message from higher up"

1602845779510845,2:54:49,Elias Moeketsi,"@Eric Dom, Zuma didn't still alone"
1602845784113350,2:54:53,Infinite Volume,@Sithembiso Nyawo I think its maybe dirty money that caused power for him cause if he gets zuma in trouble zuma will prob get people on him

1602845976457082,2:58:05,Tommygun,The idea that cadres be used to run SOEs whilst having little or no business experience ever is laughable. Most directors lives have been spent in politics and relying on the public purse.
1602846004111419,2:58:33,Infinite Volume,Does anyone know of a live stream about what's happening in senekal?
