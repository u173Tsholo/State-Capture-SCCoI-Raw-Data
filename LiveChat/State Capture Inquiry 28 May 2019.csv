1559032324690209,30:16,Muriel Haynes,yesterday was shocking revelation
1559032378834390,31:11,Mzalwane Mzala,I like her confidence @Siziwe Khalatha
1559032561177247,34:12,Ben Hashem,We need to get a president with a rainbow heart. No matter the skin color. The corruption is destroying our nation.
1559032956425187,40:47,makhosi nobhatyi,@Madelein Huxtable I am watching this procedures and breaking news about revelations of Gordhan issued by PP is damaging President in cleaning up. But we wish Gordhan not be included in the cabinet
1559032963561548,40:54,welton paulse,"Mara whats going on here, almost tea time already and nothing been done thus far."

1559033164351070,44:16,makhosi nobhatyi,"Gordhan must challenge this outcome if he feels not happy with, as a country we need his leadership credibility and experience to clean up these entities so that we run smooth government"
1559033388894613,48:00,Lorna Kavanagh,Gordhan is going to challenge PP report
1559033727356968,53:38,Lorna Kavanagh,This PP is going after the wrong people..... there are plenty criminals in high office who need to be investigated.
1559033796802622,54:48,Derek Main,@Lorna Kavanagh Yeah - it seems she has an agenda.
1559033820700165,55:12,Felix Muyoba,@Lorna Kavanagh but your version seems to be biased to gordham..why dont you leave the PP to do its job?
1559033868927901,56:01,Thuto Che' M,We are living in interesting times! The show of character will be how DPP responds and prosecute those found wanting...
1559033903004764,56:33,Felix Muyoba,imagine if someone you dont like..am sure you could be supporting the PP @Lorna Kavanagh
1559033949435717,57:20,Mzalwane Mzala,I hold no brief for this PP but I am disgusted by the double standards displayed by some South Africans. No one is above investigation. The review process is available to challenge reports.
1559033984186596,57:55,Felix Muyoba,@Mzalwane Mzala exactly thats my point!
1559034099821302,59:51,Wildthing,Mzala I agree. but they should be targeting the once with the most zeros behind the corruption first then work down. Pravin has proven he is good at busting up corruption but is not 100% innocent
1559034192214573,1:01:22,Wildthing,and before people jump on the Stienhoff case. I invested even if not a lot it still money so yes I am waiting for that case in court to. nothing to do with white or black. it was an international scam
1559034199432798,1:01:30,Mzalwane Mzala,Anyone who insists on telling the PP who to investigate and not investigate has no respect for the independence of that office.
1559034242270345,1:02:13,Wildthing,as a Tax payer people have a right. it's there money been lost to criminals
1559034252127622,1:02:23,Jack Sparrow,@Mzalwane Mzala Yet the pp is displaying a shocking abuse of power
1559034296371598,1:03:07,Wildthing,her report on the Cow farm was so shocking it could have been done by a 15 year old
1559034311554264,1:03:23,Mzalwane Mzala,You can not argue against abuse while you insist on breaking the law.
1559034315879816,1:03:27,Anne M.,"The next PP might be another Thuli, even if the current one is making questionable decisions being overturned by the court. We have to protect the office of the PP."
1559034324016596,1:03:35,Born free,The witness is dressed for the Oscar's.. love the bowtie.. 😂
1559034376657061,1:04:28,Jack Sparrow,the pp is playing politics. it's not acceptable.
1559034415987436,1:05:08,Mzalwane Mzala,@Jack Sparrow Is it acceptable to curtail her independence with regard to whom she can investigate?
1559034434987669,1:05:25,Born free,Yes but non of them are politicians
1559034455198483,1:05:46,Jack Sparrow,@Mzalwane Mzala she's not displaying independence
1559034478615894,1:06:10,Mzalwane Mzala,@Jack Sparrow You are fdisplaying independence. lol
1559034505956080,1:06:37,Wildthing,how could she leave Ace out of the cow farm. if you can answer that in a fair way then I will respect you and your opinion
1559034506086882,1:06:37,Jack Sparrow,"I agree the law must take its course, and she'll get hammered, but one can do political damage by not obeying your mandate"
1559034511868380,1:06:43,Mzalwane Mzala,@Jack Sparrow You are being objective and fair. Lol
1559034561290748,1:07:32,Mzalwane Mzala,The court has made a finding on that and she was wrong. That has nothing to do with other investigations.
1559034562398245,1:07:33,Jack Sparrow,c'mon. two reports on the eve of a cabinet announcement? Both in haste? GAL.
1559034677199535,1:09:29,Derek Main,The PP seems to be part of the state capture project.
1559034690745979,1:09:41,Jack Sparrow,@Derek Main she's certainly not harming it
1559034699024041,1:09:50,Lorna Kavanagh,She would be more credible if she investigated Brian Molefe ....
1559034722701163,1:10:13,Jack Sparrow,@Lorna Kavanagh or any of the many people implicated in this commission
1559034889220136,1:13:00,Wildthing,is it not SARS internal lawyers and managements role to investigate the Pravin case and take actions. HR must take some blame too if it was illegal action. SAA has lost millions and she has done ?
1559034905267208,1:13:17,Lorna Kavanagh,Billions have been looted from this country and she would serve SA better by investigating more ofthe implicated people..
1559034987244759,1:14:38,Lorna Kavanagh,.... and just look at Eskoms debt alone ..
1559035031707736,1:15:23,Lorna Kavanagh,Zuma appointee...
1559035055888885,1:15:46,Cassius Mngomezulu,No EFF Appointee
1559035089482914,1:16:21,Derek Main,Thank goodness the state capture report was already done before Thuli left - we may never have had this commission otherwise.
1559035104548936,1:16:35,Lorna Kavanagh,so true
1559035708361685,1:26:40,Wilson Hishono,very true Zuma sat on it...
1559035764186530,1:27:35,Derek Main,@Wilson Hishono Yep - Zuma tried to squash it. Now we know why.
1559035965235796,1:30:55,Wilson Hishono,I think the chronies want to flee south africa but where to ?
1559036009587510,1:31:40,Derek Main,The very rich ones are headed to Dubai.
1559037097100740,1:49:48,Wilson Hishono,SA needs to strengthen bilateral agreements on extradition of suspects especially from DUBAI ...where are the GUPTAS Hiding anyway?
1559037175648093,1:51:07,Anne M.,@Wilson Hishono Agree. My understanding is that the Guptas are in Dubai and the NDPP has set things in motion regarding extradition.

1559038167106842,2:07:39,Derek Main,This is the nuts and bolts of the evidence. Molefe's emails etc.
1559038189278689,2:08:00,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@makhosi nobhatyi This PP is a mess. We don't need this rot in the midst of our country's tumultuous state
1559038236595388,2:08:48,Derek Main,The PP is a very important institution - agreed. But do you feel protected by the current PP?
1559038311064916,2:10:02,Derek Main,"Yes - in this particular case but for the long term, we need a solution."
1559038384006293,2:11:15,Jack Sparrow,The current PP is not no my side
1559038402011189,2:11:33,clive oconnell,If only ANC parachuted management could devote their skills to growing the country not stealing its assets.
1559038408542475,2:11:39,Derek Main,I definitely don't feel she is looking after my interests.
1559038408997809,2:11:39,Mzalwane Mzala,The self-righteous only likes the law and legal process when it favors them.
1559038457360778,2:12:28,Mzalwane Mzala,They don't care about that
1559038490069654,2:13:01,Derek Main,We seen that game played by politicians forever. I'm tired of that. Legal processes take too long.
1559038560738454,2:14:12,Jack Sparrow,According to the law: “On what basis she could justifiably come to such a conclusion is unclear. It points either to ineptitude or gross negligence in the execution of her duties.”
1559038646936915,2:15:38,Derek Main,It's just that the PP has been slapped down a few times and doesn't seem to be tackling the priority issues.
1559038671414572,2:16:02,Mzalwane Mzala,"'The DA election strategists (ironically most of them white) concluded that if they could crush me publicly, we would truly, at last, lose our ""white-party"" image' Hellen Zille"
1559038697895893,2:16:28,Jack Sparrow,@Derek Main c'mon. exonerating mabusa is surely a priority issue for some
1559038723334810,2:16:54,Jack Sparrow,the problem is whose issues is she prioritising
1559038727100719,2:16:58,Mzalwane Mzala,"'This is not a conspiracy theory. I have a document that was circulated to the Federal Executive, explaining it' Zille."
1559038745263543,2:17:16,Derek Main,That's what I'm saying - not mine.
1559038784371174,2:17:55,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Lets not forget that Zuma and Shaun Abrahams use the very same tactics to bring Pravin down! This is a total witch-hunt. Why this PP exonerates ACE Magashule from that Free State Dairy project?
1559038790886627,2:18:02,Derek Main,Yes - gave him early retirement and then re-employed him.
1559038832347394,2:18:43,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Zuma and Shaun Abrahams used the very same witch hunt tactics.... lets not forget @Derek Main
1559038905128282,2:19:56,Derek Main,"Yes - I agree but PG can be investigated like any of us. If he was wrong, he must pay the price. If not, his name will be clear."
1559038915508063,2:20:06,Kevin Simon,Also keeping an eye on the EFF -VBS matter unfolding. Multitasking.
1559038958612556,2:20:50,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Let's see what explanation he has for that.
1559038992835498,2:21:24,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Derek Main Yes, i wasn't one of the happiest employee at SARS under Pravin, but this PP is ""incredible,"" as they will say in the legal fraternity"
