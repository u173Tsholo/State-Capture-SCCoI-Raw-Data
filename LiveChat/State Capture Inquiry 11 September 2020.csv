1599811570656237,0:40,watson mutanga,@Wesley Myburgh: then we have an excuse of being racially discriminated against. The ANC are the liberators and as such are entitled to plundering state coffers. The list of excuses is endless.
1599811611429228,1:30,Fred Desrosiers,"@Watson mutanga, True. but it is anyone in the world who let themselves be misled by politicians and political parties."

1599812200105624,11:18,watson mutanga,"@Wesley Myburgh: entitlement is the main issue with the ANC. The ANC captured the state, the ANC in turn was captured by the Guptas. It’s difficult to entangle the web."

1599812745193010,20:23,watson mutanga,Our biggest pitfall is our belief that education and religion are the answers to our challenges. Look at the CVs of most managers in SEOs. Very impressive CVs but not competent enough.

1599812828994023,21:46,watson mutanga,"Integrity can’t be taught, no matter the reputation of the education institution."

1599813565871961,33:58,Mike Newlands,Always remembering that these crooks never ever thought they would have to explain thier crooked thieving so hardly covered thier tracks.
1599813570723703,34:06,Frank Jordaan,Mike are you thinking of Anot Singh. He was at Transnet and then came over to Escom with Molefe. Investigations revealed that he never touched his salary paid into his account for 4 years.
1599813577575605,34:17,Abel Matshidiso,@Daniel Norman indeed he's my home boy frm Mahikeng but done his studies in the UK
1599813602093024,34:41,kagiso Mathole,who is the guy always sitting behind the advocates. .....he must love being seen on tv....

1599813799380160,37:20,Leon Mbangwa,"I don't believe on that assertion of stolen money yet we have the Auditor General, and so many oversight investigative bodies who had annual tasks to tell us about books and accounts. It's all hogwash"
1599813800074066,37:20,Itumeleng Daniel Mothoagae,Ngubane is lying...what is he taking us for? personal email contents changed to eskom email. Really🙄🙄
1599813823147510,37:34,Mike Newlands,@Leon Mbangwa The idea was to maintian the equipment and balance that against little or no rolling blackouts. Sadly this bunch of thieves did nothing.
1599813869668009,37:56,Anovuyo Cebe,So Dr Ngubane can easly use Eskom system yet its dificult to page a file😂😂😂 what a joke

1599813947671003,39:16,Itumeleng Daniel Mothoagae,There is a difference between personal and work email. Is he talking to techno fools or what?
1599813955925002,39:26,Alvino Theunissen,I wonder...What was the Company policy on using Eskom email address and not using company business communication on private email?
1599813968066208,39:37,Mbuso Ndlovu,"@Aimee Zuma must be forgiven, we all make mistakes"

1599814929054689,52:57,Fred Desrosiers,African countries should stop putting people in positions due to title. Competency should be the primary factor in putting position of power.

1599815563485226,1:03:31,Morag Swanepoel,Khutele. Mr Tstotsi was the previous chairman at Eskom who it's alleged was fired and This man put in his place due to connections with Guptas. so basically the Guptas got Tstotsi fired.
1599815572696104,1:03:41,Connie Skosana,Technical explanations were just too technical and complex for this doctor and board member.
1599815584773988,1:03:52,Elliot Vusumuzi,was he an independent or executive chairperson?

1599816119811439,1:12:48,Mambaman,If malema had t been kicked out of ANC he might also be sitting in the witness seat
1599816127168996,1:12:54,Nondumiso Soko,the relationship between the minister and the Eskom board is way beyond that of public concerns

1599816244712529,1:14:53,Eddie Reddy,Rob then you re overpaid
1599816299116353,1:15:47,Itumeleng Daniel Mothoagae,"Ngubane is a proud man. He doesn't seem to see anything wrong in what he did. The question still remains if you knew why didn't you do anything? What sort of leadership is this? So, she worked alone."
1599816310794644,1:15:59,Frank Jordaan,So you could give the board the biggest load of bull they would just approve it.
1599816325334482,1:16:13,L Ll,"The whole idea of being employed is to earn as much as possible, and do as little as possible too 😉"

1599816441506330,1:18:09,Eddie Reddy,"LLl why work,just get one tender"
1599816452686544,1:18:20,Frank Jordaan,Miss Daniels should have been the CEO. She knew everything according to Ben.
1599816475943713,1:18:43,Mambaman,Uncle Ben knows how to drive people under the bus
1599816478194831,1:18:46,Samuel Skosana,Did Zuma instruct the Minister to appoint Ngubane
1599816479936342,1:18:47,L Ll,"We cannot all get tenders, can we? 😳"

1599816534322416,1:19:42,Lebohang Mofokeng,he is proud and arrogant he does not see anything wrong
1599816559842597,1:20:08,Frank Jordaan,Samuel the perception is that they got rid of Tsotshi to appoint their 'man'.
1599816567494969,1:20:15,Eddie Reddy,Frank that's why dr Ben's personal business got liquidated. Karma
1599816573430776,1:20:21,Samuel Skosana,Money is the root of all evil
1599816616646304,1:21:05,L Ll,The LOVE OF MONEY is the root to all evil
1599816621119582,1:21:09,Frank Jordaan,Eddy jip.
1599816627280291,1:21:15,Lebohang Mofokeng,I dont have respect for him anyway maybe he wanted full acceptance because before joining the ANC HE WAS AN INKATHA MEMBER
1599816748946802,1:23:17,Samuel Skosana,The difference between Inkatha and ANC is in the uniforms they wear
1599816760971306,1:23:29,Eddie Reddy,dr was prime minister of kzn when he was with Inkata
1599816820606043,1:24:29,Beverley Barrett,Knowing he did not understand the technical details he should never have been allowed to remain.
1599816899553191,1:25:47,Vuyisani Sikobi,"Inkatha was a reactionary cultural organization, it was after liberation that the ANC got infiltrated by counter-revolutionary forces whose main aim was to loot the state cofers"
1599816957533363,1:26:46,Samuel Skosana,A mere change of uniform then
1599816964118651,1:26:52,Eddie Reddy,Sikobi correct
1599816964962973,1:26:52,Mike Newlands,"@Beverley Barrett technically he could give a stuff about ESKOM his job was to loot, lie and steal,technically speaking."
1599816988109725,1:27:16,Frank Jordaan,That board had no idea what was happening at Escom. They only had one objective and the smooth running of Escom did not feature.
1599817213435957,1:31:01,Nondumiso Soko,so they don't know who this businessman is or they rather not say?
1599817232522477,1:31:20,Frank Jordaan,So my predecessor did it!!!
1599817266166615,1:31:54,Joel Aphane,the businessman is white 🤣🤣🤣
1599817324294400,1:32:53,Frank Jordaan,Ndumien it is clear that it was Essa. Pamensky also used the same email address to send secret Escom documents to.

1599821846248740,2:47:55,Pious Senne,just near lunch now I wonder who's sponsoring food
1599821857905685,2:48:04,Russia Magezi,"As much as I hate the ANC, but I agree that the current leader inherited the mess. I pity CR though he's one of them."

1599822007413250,2:50:35,Thobani Mkananda,@Russia Magezi my sympathy for him is exhausted by his involvement in governance long before h ed became president. He knew exactly what the state of affairs were. Arguably he was comfortable

1599822131382425,2:52:38,Andrew Mboweni,president ramaphosa believe in academic research he never spent a night at alexandra and see for himself how hard life is rather than flying all over the globe claiming to be the leader that care
