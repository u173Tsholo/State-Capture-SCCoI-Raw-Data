1555576427594650,29:45,Nosiphiwo Zantsi,@Cameron Kim The tribal law statement is insulting. Rather talk of customary law.
1555576427950286,29:45,Cameron Kim,@Simdisiwe Seshoka @Reformed Youth I see you can not answer the question.
1555576435353790,29:53,Johnny Cash,The ANC is rotten and captured

1555576615877933,32:53,Cameron Kim,@Nosiphiwo Zantsi the correct name is Indigenous Law and tough at Universities- so stone age in my opinion

1555576655654655,33:33,Derek Main,@Bongumenzi Nxumalo Expecting the ANC to fix corruption is like expecting the Ku Klux Klan to fix racial prejudice.
1555576661314237,33:39,Cameron Kim,@Musa Bakiti is tribal law also applicable on non- blacks>?
1555576678903626,33:56,Cameron Kim,@John Wilson correct

1555578053206526,56:50,rohan barnard,PWHC again involved....
1555578068608128,57:06,Musa Bakiti,@Derek Main that's rude
1555578078917592,57:16,Norman Zwane,"Judge is not too impressed with Ms September. He keeps correcting her, and she keeps acting like a Jnr counsel."
1555578086036158,57:23,Alexander Dowding,PWC are brilliant. Best accounting auditors in the world.
1555578139725137,58:17,Derek Main,"@Musa Bakiti What is? When you have something significant to say, speak - otherwise keep it to yourself."

1555578214850029,59:32,Cameron Kim,@Reformed Youth - AFRICA (AFRIKA) the name is a white mans name for the continent known as Azania
1555578249087757,1:00:07,Yvonne Morudu,I agree anyone who is racist is mentally challenged
1555578268814970,1:00:26,Alexander Dowding,Has President Ramaphosa promised to bring back the Scorpions yet? South Africa needs them back. Best fighters of corruption in government we have ever had. Hence why President 783 had them disbanded.
1555578289464783,1:00:47,Norman Zwane,@African Refugee I think its also a bit painful with the experience he has to watch a junior flounder trying to get into drips with a complex testimony like this.
1555578293563240,1:00:51,Cameron Kim,@Yvonne Morudu only white people are racists - I never seen a black racists - have you ?

1555578547981399,1:05:05,11soccerdad,"@Cameron Kim if you are suggesting that any black person who hates a white person is justified in their hate, I have no comment."
1555578557983700,1:05:15,Cameron Kim,@11soccerdad - No only white people can be racists
1555578563759012,1:05:20,Alexander Dowding,"Since Busisiwe Mkhwebane, 49, took over the office, she’s been accused of bias by the High Court, and almost a third of the reports issued during her tenure are facing legal challenges."

1555580832915035,1:43:10,Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Nah - Agrizzi is corrupt. That would be more of the same. Booysen I can agree with.
1555580838390434,1:43:16,Sindiswa Moolman,Mine is in jail @Cameron Kim. I heard he may be pardoned very soon
1555580843051240,1:43:20,Vuyelwa Schrooders,"why Zulu king in particular?? There are so many kings in South Africa, but they don't get the same previleges."

1555580866550448,1:43:44,StarManRSA,Aren't the Zulu kings the most powerful in SA?
1555580876100091,1:43:53,Cameron Kim,@Vuyelwa Schrooders yes there are 7 Kings and all get government money
1555580918332841,1:44:36,Sindiswa Moolman,Is the one jail also getting money @Cameron Kim?
1555580924584041,1:44:42,Magda Seguin,"I don't know about powerful,the Zulu king lives in luxury with his 12 wives in absolute luxury"
1555580933440013,1:44:51,Cameron Kim,@Sindiswa Moolman Will the Zula King vote for a Venda without Government grants ?
1555580950377768,1:45:07,Magda Seguin,And on tax money...our blood and sweat
1555580974732807,1:45:32,Cameron Kim,@Sindiswa Moolman So you can not answer the question -

1555581047126198,1:46:44,Cameron Kim,@Vuyelwa Schrooders because the colonialist are moving factories away - no more foreign income = ZIMBABWE
1555581077938625,1:47:15,Cameron Kim,@Sindiswa Moolman hmmmmm yes - Black Volkstate and Kingdoms
1555581093926351,1:47:31,Magda Seguin,"Go to KZN and see the abject poverty, I was there in November last year...The city is a cesspool of dirt and dilapidated buildings downtown"
1555581099942610,1:47:37,Vuyelwa Schrooders,why should we maintain his 12 wives and 50 children??
1555581125706391,1:48:03,Cameron Kim,@Vuyelwa Schrooders dont warry - The Swazi King is over 50 wives
1555581152850839,1:48:30,Magda Seguin,We are maintaining his entire household and he insists on getting more
1555581231731543,1:49:49,Magda Seguin,I don't mind traditional leaders getting stipends for their work but the Zulu king does absolutely nothing for the country
1555581236222177,1:49:53,Cameron Kim,I SEE NOBODY CAN HAVE AN INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION WITH ME '
1555581248483598,1:50:06,Vuyelwa Schrooders,"our tax money is abused left and right. It's like we dnt have any say over anything, as citizens of this country."

1555581291219799,1:50:48,Sindiswa Moolman,Say is again @Vuyelwa Schrooders
1555581365331154,1:52:02,Sindiswa Moolman,Instead he charges his subjects more tax. @Magda Sequin
1555581393378593,1:52:31,Cameron Kim,@Derek Main thank you - but see the level of education ( see 30 %) pass rate also
1555581434059239,1:53:11,Magda Seguin,It's like tapping blood out if a stone yet his 'subject's are ready to take up arms for him @Sindiswa Moolman
1555581453861632,1:53:31,Cameron Kim,@Sindiswa Moolman 50 5 correct - more tax - more money printing = hippo inflation = Zim
1555581455618102,1:53:33,Musa Bakiti,Nathi my bro
1555581524012879,1:54:41,Cameron Kim,@Musa Bakiti when the EFf runs out of money - how much will tax increase and the ZAR depreciated ? Guess you guys must buy the nice western things now
1555581584132674,1:55:41,Magda Seguin,"ANC ministers are cowards,we are still waiting for Ace to go to court to sue the author of Gangster State"

1555583491389752,2:27:28,Sthakathi Khumalo,Derek Main But that goes to the rot of the legal system.. imagine having an alleged fraudster running a bank for example..
1555583532664184,2:28:10,Sindiswa Moolman,Eish... these people. Was it necessary to arrest him in his office?
1555583562962860,2:28:40,Sindiswa Moolman,Surely they tipped the media’s well

1555583603348731,2:29:21,Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo I don't want to give the impression I condone extra-judicial killings. That is such a murky story though.
1555583614369398,2:29:32,Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo It may well have been that this story was to discredit Booysen as we have heard of other such cases.
1555583623939620,2:29:41,Born free,fraudsters have been running a bank the VBS that is why there is the PIC Enquiry

1555583840849342,2:33:18,Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo I don't know that he went to congratulate them - he may have gone to investigate circumstances. The fact that he went in a helicopter is irrelevant.
