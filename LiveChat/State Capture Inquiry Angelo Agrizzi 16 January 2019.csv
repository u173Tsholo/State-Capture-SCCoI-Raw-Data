1547629464214943,53:57,Derek Main,@peter sikoshule For eg - the whole of SA knew that Zuma was corrupt to the core but the ANC cadres saved him time and time again subjecting us all to his misrule. We now have to pick up the pieces.

1547629672286243,57:26,Derek Main,OK - there might be one or two innocents but by far the majority of the ANC are corrupt. A huge patronage network.

1547629878660575,1:00:52,peter sikoshule,yeah there is no ANC without voters and voters are majority
1547629896626297,1:01:10,Derek Main,All those voters are hoping for their time at the trough. Otherwise why would they support clearly corrupt office bearers?
1547629998107809,1:02:51,South Africans in Paris,Let's move on from politics and have some fun with this.
1547630045845987,1:03:39,Derek Main,Somebody has to enlighten the ANC voters

1547630104314872,1:04:38,peter sikoshule,voters have been complaining about allegations of corruption in the ANC which doesn't make them corrupt. some even left the party due to their unhappiness. WE AGREE AND WE FIXING

1547630207860768,1:06:21,Biza330,The people of South Africa are blind and being mislead by the ANC. The Anc is corrupt.
1547630208255598,1:06:22,South Africans in Paris,Is anyone else thinking of eating Tumbles? This is a subliminal ad for Cadburys Tumbles.
1547630222261351,1:06:36,Derek Main,The ANC voters make the mistake of thinking that the ANC leaders actually care about them
1547630255214249,1:07:09,peter sikoshule,individuals in the ANC not ANC. we fixing that . this state capture we watching forms part of cleaning
