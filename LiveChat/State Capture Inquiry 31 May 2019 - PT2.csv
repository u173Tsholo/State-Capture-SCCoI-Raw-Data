1559307073245792,48:46,Born free,The delay of Ramophosa 's announcement of his ministers was due to a last ditched plea not to appoint Mabuza as deputy President.

1559308188115841,1:06:55,SBH Shembe,@Lee Hendrix will the elite that control everything ever allow Africa to thrive on its own?
1559308256229283,1:08:04,Zola Pinda,Gama has sold black South African entrepreneurs together with his executive team.They all
1559308353396235,1:09:41,Zola Pinda,they have to be accountable
1559308494452659,1:12:02,Zola Pinda,The executives get paid lots of money. South Africans should hold all executives accountable.
1559308530401010,1:12:38,SBH Shembe,"yes Money is the controlling factor spot on there... which is really sad, I think as a race money is holding us back"
1559308571129981,1:13:18,Floyd Ramoshaba,what purpose does this inquiries serve?
1559308733318646,1:16:01,Zola Pinda,Executives were there. They must all account. It can't be just Gama and Molefe. All executives should account. They were part of EXCO.
1559308734191903,1:16:02,SBH Shembe,to investigate allegations into state capture
1559308842275557,1:17:50,Born free,These implicated have ruined Transnets reputation anything related to the Guptas is corruptible and questionable.

1559308938907804,1:19:26,SBH Shembe,@Lucy Lucy exactly .. I really liked Transnet
1559309035273678,1:21:03,Piet Madimetja,We want those millions and billions back. They can create more jobs.
1559309067023343,1:21:34,Zola Pinda,NPA should take over. There's enough evidence to get the best picture. State Capture looters must face our mighty law. They must have sleepless nights.
1559310171456884,1:39:59,Zola Pinda,State owned entities are not private companies. The appointed executives are obligated to differ with their 'bosses' they are all civil servants at the end of the day.
1559310469508076,1:44:57,Zola Pinda,It's silly of the Transnet executives to only blame Gama and Molefe. They must all take responsibility. EXCO members must tell us as tax payers what happened.
1559310472525834,1:45:00,Born free,Exactly these ministers are public servants
1559310740717186,1:49:28,Born free,Unfortunately all these financial contractual blunders and misdemeanors have effected any growth in the economy and will have a lasting impact on our economies growth.

1559311662175025,2:04:50,Mzalwane Mzala,Why are Gama and Molefe's names appearing a lot. Did these other conspre against them?
1559311683157166,2:05:10,Mzalwane Mzala,Did they conspire?
