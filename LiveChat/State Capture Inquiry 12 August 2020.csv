1597223472128985,59:07,Tshepo Hlatshwayo,And why are we still voting anc to power if these are a waste of time?
1597223550851497,1:00:26,Eugene,I never voted once in my life. so you should ask yourself that question.
1597223610110868,1:01:16,Thami Ngwenya,We are not ignorant

1597224218126497,1:05:26,Eugene,So the best thing to do to get over Apartheid is to suffer under the ANC?
1597224316749678,1:07:05,Thami Ngwenya,"You are not forced to vote for ANC, THERE ARE MORE THAN 40 PARTIES TO CHOOSE FROM, BUT ME and my house will vote ANC"
1597224359248903,1:07:46,Makhosini Floyd zwane,We need to develop an no racial no apartheid party in the country. all these parties are doing is to continuously misuse state resources to benefit themselves.
1597224529853625,1:10:36,Eugene,or keep voting for the ANC because you too have your hands on the cookie jar

1597224642546946,1:12:30,Selvan Thambiran,every person has a right to vote for a party. Our purpose to vote is not just to put a particular party or individual into power but rather to elect to have our lives and surrounds improved.

1597224718937447,1:13:45,Eugene,Thami doesn't want improvements she likes things just the way it is.
1597224740968697,1:14:07,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,What people do not realize is that there is much better life than what the ANC offer. People voted for the NP for the very same reasons people now vote for the ANC - there is no strong opposition
1597224746160950,1:14:13,Lehlohonolo Tsepo Kganakga,uphi lama ANC tender ü§£
1597224815787065,1:15:23,Selvan Thambiran,If you feel a specific party or individual is not to your benefit then you may vote for another party. Voting for the same party again will not give a different outcome based on their track record
1597224822714138,1:15:27,Thami Ngwenya,"Compare 2003 and today is far better, we do do have challenges but going there"
1597224823480107,1:15:28,Melvict Melbourne,People voted for the NP because they knew this would happen.
1597224865025537,1:16:12,Melvict Melbourne,but they are dumb

1597224915437666,1:17:02,Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,Zimbabweans are an example of educated people still making uneducated decisions.
1597224927888311,1:17:14,Sanjay Maharaj,funny how similar the lives of Zimbabweans and South Africans are so very similar... an African curse??
1597224935375072,1:17:21,Melvict Melbourne,that is very true
1597224959328815,1:17:46,Selvan Thambiran,Zimbabweans voted as die hards for Zanupf like it was a soccer team and sadly most of the population is now in South Africa. I asked some of them why did you not vote for another party
1597224986072544,1:18:12,Melvict Melbourne,and what did they say
1597225062977038,1:19:30,Eugene,They voted wrong because of the brainwash methods of Marxism
1597225075890620,1:19:44,Melvict Melbourne,I saw a photo of an old woman next to a shack wearing a oversize ANC T-shirt
1597225099630806,1:20:05,Melvict Melbourne,and I didn't feel any sympathy.
1597225118904003,1:20:24,Melvict Melbourne,She got what she voted for
1597225217583884,1:22:04,Makhosini Floyd zwane,The majority party needs to be treated as they treat us.
1597225337021897,1:24:05,Eugene,I saw a arm less black guy wearing a DA t-shirt he told me he used to vote for the ANC before his arms were cut off I didn't ask any questions after that.
1597225387764111,1:24:56,Eugene,Guess his legs will be next
1597225561720424,1:27:49,Melvict Melbourne,Why do people wear political party clothing? it is not a sports team.
1597225592144391,1:28:19,Eugene,"You can support this arm less guy if you want to. You will find him on a street corner in Albertskroon, Johannesburg. He normally stands there with a DA shirt on."

1597226245719511,1:39:12,Eugene,Refaat are you from South Africa?
1597226258657566,1:39:26,Dominic Przybylski,This is so tedious. Enough now. There is enough evidence to prove that unethical people will be corrupt if given an opportunity. We don't need years worth of testimony to enlighten us.
1597226260721032,1:39:28,Refaat Yaacoub Agha,australia hahaha
1597226282438190,1:39:49,Eugene,this is a courtroom in South Africa

1597226378826191,1:41:26,Dominic Przybylski,We now need to find a way to prevent corruption and how are we going to do that when there is no law enforcement?
1597226413264695,1:42:00,Zamile Hina,"whats wrong now ,tea time is over ,lets start zondo"
1597226481420837,1:43:09,Dominic Przybylski,BEE has cause huge corruption. EWC is going to put the nails into the economy's coffin.
1597226517639352,1:43:46,Dominic Przybylski,EWC is simply legalised theft.
1597226579599917,1:44:45,Thulani Mpanza,I made submissions to that commission online from June 2018 onwards until I physically came there on 21 February 2019 but thereafter I realized that the Commission itself is captured.
1597226658231171,1:46:04,Selvan Thambiran,this commission is doing outstanding work but we still await Zuma to testify
1597226668718399,1:46:16,Thulani Mpanza,I was automatically unfairly dismissed by the KZN ANC and KZNDOE on 13 June 2016 for being a Shembe discipline.
1597226682132100,1:46:30,Eugene,BEE is also legalise theft. Supporting BEE is like supporting Ramaphosa with his billions while other people starve. Ramaphosa has made billions by creating laws that people should hand over their com

1597226775900286,1:48:03,Dominic Przybylski,I think we've forgotten what the purpose of this commission is. It's become a bloated waste of time. All Zondo can do in the end is make recommendations which the ruling party can ignore.
1597226855820406,1:49:22,Eugene,I'm going to go now and stop wasting my time here. Because I know at the end of the day nothing will be solved.
1597226866447270,1:49:33,Rob Nel,"This commission, is an eye blind and waste of money"

1597227196784272,1:55:02,Makhosini Floyd zwane,All commission are setup to divert the current status on the actual issues faced by the country.
1597227243544532,1:55:51,Makhosini Floyd zwane,This is a military strategy
1597227318401378,1:57:05,Makhosini Floyd zwane,"Currently the country focus is on the commission outcome, while the same people are still subcontracting under the subcontractor stealing from the poor"
1597227319464488,1:57:06,Melusi Sikakane,It is unfortunate that even judges have allowed themselves to be used by anc factions. This guy who is cross examining is also involved in the prasa saga
1597227399966883,1:58:28,skilash Skilash,"@Dominic Przybylski - True. But I think with the latest amendments to the state capture regulations, the NPA will be looking at this commission differently. I think lots of prosecutions will follow."
1597227862936994,2:06:10,zizipho vusiwe,stealing from the public is inappropriate and uninspired in our constitute
1597228091984640,2:09:59,Dominic Przybylski,"@skilash Skilash NPA has evaporated. We should be hearing testimony in specific court prosecutions which lead to convictions, not in commissions of inquiry which lead only to recommendations."
1597228225717688,2:12:14,Dominic Przybylski,This commission is a dog which does not even bark let alone bite.
1597228290322012,2:13:18,Dominic Przybylski,It has no teeth.
1597228388870272,2:14:56,Dominic Przybylski,Same as our president.

1597229331347636,2:30:38,Dominic Przybylski,"We have a government which calls theft ""redistribution of wealth"" or ""expropriation without compensation"" or ""radical economic transformation"" so it cannot be treated as a crime."
1597229341566774,2:30:48,Elma Duvenhage,A total time and money waste as nothing will come from this
1597229361080609,2:31:08,kevindbn007,we need a new party in govt

1597229805221602,2:38:31,Dominic Przybylski,We are in a country of two systems: Capitalist system and Communist system - the host and parasite respectively. Unfortunately the parasite is now bigger than the host and will be the demise of both.
1597229805253487,2:38:31,Elma Duvenhage,"they have evidence, months of inquiries and to date no court date for any involved. what is the point"

1597230076088661,2:43:03,Elma Duvenhage,I know there is allot of countries with issues but honestly I think SA ranks at the top of the list. Coming home with GOLD MEDALS. One super cool government üôÇ
1597230204487076,2:45:11,Dominic Przybylski,The R70 billion borrowed from IMF at 1%. Rand has already lost 2% against Dollar since then so already we will have to repay 3% i.e. three times more.
1597230291601098,2:46:39,Riaan DW,"DoDo, lol .None of them are worried. When last did a politician go to jail, that wasn't ""critically ill ""?"
1597230308183992,2:46:55,Elma Duvenhage,I wonder who the poor persons were who had been given the task to type out these reports:(
1597230331130743,2:47:18,Dominic Przybylski,We cannot carry on stealing what we are borrowing. It's not the government which will have to repay. It's the people who will have to pay.

1597230408632883,2:48:35,CYRIL NDABA,Which other African country has ever accessed an IMF loan? Seemingly we are the only one. I am subject to correction on this. I see us going back to the IMF in the not-too-distant future!
1597230423939351,2:48:50,Dominic Przybylski,In normal democracy the people(voters) would not allow criminals to rule them.
1597230530994878,2:50:38,Dominic Przybylski,If they are allowed to rule then the people who allowed it will have to live with the consequences.
1597230623084213,2:52:09,CYRIL NDABA,Expect the Government to announce a slight increase of R1OO to social grants just before the local government elections in 2021.
1597230661102812,2:52:47,Dodo,The IMF should be informed to not hand over any funds to the government. Fund the Red Cross and have them distribute as they see fit. These funds will never get to those who needs it the most.
1597230808158373,2:55:15,Dodo,Just R 700 million so far.
