1542976287961768,22:10,DJ DJ,i think he could be a stand up comic
1542976654772006,28:16,Coach,"This witness appears nervous, he does not seem to comprehend questions."
1542977377833486,40:20,Nelson Musoliwa,Finance ministry is so important as it regulates state revenue and costing which underpin GDP that is why zuma recklessness is still felt by all of us
1542977453574731,41:35,Genevieve Pilz,Why is he talking about WMC?
1542977812455539,47:34,AYE!! its yaddy,Viva ANC Viva

1542977927037409,49:29,Thapelo Masie,this guy seems guilty of something
1542978083154873,52:05,Nelson Musoliwa,How can a ddg issue a national statement without contacting his dg. It doesn't make sense to me
1542978106430309,52:28,Desmond Masilela,This guy knows something or his hiding it?
1542978139050778,53:01,DJ DJ,think they will get to the point and names will be dropped he seems itching to spill the beans
1542978165709261,53:27,Thapelo Masie,he keeps running away when they ask him about names
1542978252845075,54:55,peter pott,"@masie, he was promoted to DG role by gigaba. He feels like he owes allegiance to him. as much as fuzile holds regard for Pravin. loyalties in politics is what matters this days"
1542978333288267,56:15,Thapelo Masie,"@peter pott i see, it makes sense then"
1542978396905009,57:19,vincent mavasa,So he decide to lay for the Nation.. like Giggaba did..this guys they Gigabytes us
1542978505912192,59:07,peter pott,"well, He still in employment government. He is not certain if they will after him hereafter. Pravin looks after his subjects. Trevor got role of old mutual chairman, Fuzile got a job at std bank."
1542978523103677,59:25,vincent mavasa,ðŸ˜Œ
1542978527334896,59:29,Sandile Mabika,he seems surprised like someone wrote the statement on his behalf. i suspect pravin did
1542978646341826,1:01:28,peter pott,this commission can be wrapped in a month. if deputy chief justice can make a ruling that no more political appointees in certain departments.
1542978753356332,1:03:15,Gideon A Vele,so this guy lied in the draft media statement in order to please the markets...this guy is fishy
1542978869112191,1:05:11,peter pott,"all witnesses so far are Anc card carrying members. Mentor,pravin, hogan, Williams, jonas, manyi. i.e.. job interviews are undermined. Williams us still acting, fuzile they move dates to get him a job"
1542978974395720,1:06:56,Sandile Mabika,"des van rooyen was appointed finance minister for 3 days: i.e from friday to sunday. yet this fool is saying , minister caused much havoc in treasury amoung staff."
1542979005067785,1:07:27,peter pott,"uproot political appointees. end of story. they won't be van reopen,gigaba, pravin, manuel and now Toto. get a qualified CA , black CA to run this institutions"

1542979411577859,1:14:13,peter pott,"I don't understand this. we are displaying foolish loyalty here. Madiba appointed Chris liebenberg as first finance minister in 1994. in. 1996 he left, life moved on. many don't even recall this"

1542980409214137,1:30:50,Nanda Nair,Can somebody please explain why state capture cannot be construed as an act of treason since the actions posed a serious threat to the state and its citizens?
1542980410369204,1:30:51,Speckled Trim,Everything means nothing
1542980416523608,1:30:58,Nelson Musoliwa,Wesly can you please elaborate a bit what a profession corruption is please
