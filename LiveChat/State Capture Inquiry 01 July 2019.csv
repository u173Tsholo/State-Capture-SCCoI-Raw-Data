1561969368579447,15:47,Ibo Thabo,"Plus Judge Zondo is very slow and sometimes he needs to be update during the process, something disrupt the speaker"
1561969375695450,15:55,Sindiswa Moolman,I have the same feeling @Thembisa Odendaal
1561969420536946,16:40,Born free,WOW. So many executives were appointed through Dudu Myeni.
1561969441775138,17:00,Vuyo Saleni,hayi sandiswa nam ndicinga njalo
1561969463702487,17:23,Yolo More,Miss nineth month must not come back. She is always frustrating the chair. She must be kept busy with administration.
1561969468606160,17:27,Musa Mabunda,Can someone help me understand why Dudu Myeni and Yakhe Kwinana aren't arrested yet? Where's Adv Batohi
1561969475635131,17:34,Thabo Vuma,I realized that whenever she's the one standing the chair always take over in terms questioning the witnesses
1561969480321095,17:39,Bongani Ntuli,former COO Htlaudi Motswaneng even this one iwill make itinteresting lool
1561969591319843,19:31,Yolo More,"Musa Mabunda, and they are finishing off all the money they stole."
1561969603356089,19:42,Born free,I believe implicated persons will have an opportunity to respond at l this commission . I am sure indictments are in the process.
1561969636736885,20:16,cassim suleman,kwa dugusa service protests
1561969674410456,20:54,Musa Mabunda,"@Yolo More eish, they can chow the money but I want to see them in jail ASAP"
1561969676184508,20:56,Yolo More,Plus we want to hear their side of story here before they go to jail.
1561969714934114,21:34,Ibo Thabo,@Thabo Vuma vuma Because she destroy the story or the sense of the information by the manner she ask the questions
1561969768976514,22:28,Floyd Ramoshaba,@Yolo More These guy will never implicate them selves
1561969779499633,22:39,Musa Mabunda,"@Yolo More we will hear their side of story in court. This whole evidence will have to play it out over again in a court of law still, so why not just cut straight to chase"
1561969816364755,23:15,Thembisa Odendaal,@thabo vuma no she was told at the legotla to be the acting CEO makes me sick
1561969828365510,23:27,Ibo Thabo,@Thabo Vuma So she had to keep aside
1561969872531003,24:12,Born free,"Yes and we have to pay 9% more for electricity, refuse, water and rates as of today."
1561969938864839,25:17,Yolo More,"Musa Mabunda üòÇüòÇüòÇ, Floyd Ramoshaba, indeed, it's just the formalities."

1561969965879434,25:45,Sipho Owen Ndhlovu,"musa mabunda, a commission and a court of law operate differently and this is like an investigative process at which recommendation will be made to charge the culprits better information for the court"
1561970013917863,26:34,Musa Mabunda,@Owen yes but the same witnesses will still have to give same evidence in court
1561970162830897,29:02,Musa Mabunda,Remember the NPA will also do its own investigation and they will merely confirm the commission investigators'
1561970182604402,29:22,Tina Carvalho,hi im just in but id like to ask what hapens to the money gone . will it be returned and made to be returned with people being held to account
1561970237480645,30:16,Musa Mabunda,The commission should enlist the services of Adv Adila Hassim to work with Adv Hofmeyr. She's equally ferocious and extremely competent
1561970276029011,30:55,cassim suleman,money gone and blown..most likely in overseas havens..no chance of getting it back.best punishment is jail sentence..
1561970281229053,31:00,clive oconnell,üîÆüîÆCan you see into the minds of NPA ?
1561970290140244,31:09,Musa Mabunda,Adv. Dirk Groenewald can also do a great job
1561970336869623,31:56,Born free,State Capture is only an Enquiry not an Investigation. Judge Zondo will compile his report and recommendations as to the implicated parties. It will be up to The NPA to take this further.
1561970338932566,31:58,Tina Carvalho,is there no sales and made to pay back system
1561970342075905,32:01,cassim suleman,but npa should act immediately..based on zondo comm
1561970362631643,32:21,Norman Zwane,@Musa Mabunda Adv Hassim handled quite a few sessions in 2018 and she was ferocious
1561970364410216,32:23,Sello b Mogaila,life sentence is solution
1561970397894235,32:57,Alirio De Araujo,"Emirates fly 4 times a day to Johannesburg + Durban Cape Town, where do you thing this revenue ends? At Guptas paradise where Duduzane prefer to leave."
1561970399066009,32:58,Musa Mabunda,"Zondo himself told law enforcement not to wait for the commission, they should act as and when they hear something with which they can work"
1561970415071613,33:15,Michel Basson,Get Gerrie
1561970422304204,33:21,cassim suleman,life sentence traded against return of moneys..then reduced sentence
1561970435952500,33:35,Musa Mabunda,Adv Hassim is ferocious Maggie
1561970442332123,33:41,Norman Zwane,How the likes of Myeni can pull the race card at the most inappropiate time.
1561970443436224,33:42,Mqondisi Maphophe,This is the reality of state capture.......
1561970467456047,34:07,Born free,Yip racist. BEE is racist against a minority.
1561970480298269,34:19,cassim suleman,ancyl and all anc structures interested in positions of power so they can loot
1561970515405072,34:55,Musa Mabunda,"BEE is meant to redress the imbalances of the past, unfortunately"
1561970538882764,35:18,Tina Carvalho,only zulus?
1561970542299587,35:21,Born free,BEE is unlawful because it is racist and biased against the minority of whites.
1561970572573754,35:51,Musa Mabunda,How is it unlawful? You can argue it is unfair but not unlawful
1561970605990694,36:25,cassim suleman,no ..dont bring zulu in picture..across the board in s africa..just that the looting is related to demographics.so if done in eastern cape..the xhosa etc
1561970647754886,37:07,Born free,No where in the world do you have BEE and transformation against a minority group based on their skin colour.
1561970651689066,37:10,clive oconnell,@Musa Mabunda With a large percentage going into Gupta and pals pockets
1561970692355257,37:51,cassim suleman,magashule not xulu..he biggest culprit
1561970722886651,38:22,Musa Mabunda,@Born free unfortunately apartheid benefited only whites and to correct that we have to apply the opposite hence the BEE
1561970735313929,38:34,cassim suleman,yip
1561970749122151,38:48,Derek Main,@Musa Mabunda Apartheid ver 2.0
1561970797273400,39:36,RAMESHAN ACHARI,no money my family not keep other family my fmiy not other cantre not other state
1561970804604170,39:44,Derek Main,@cassim suleman So now it's revenge?
1561970817337157,39:56,Yolo More,I don't think Dudu Myeni is right upstairs. She is a nyaopist.
1561970820072678,40:00,cassim suleman,systematic desstruction of the fabric of a black..
1561970838291050,40:18,Musa Mabunda,She was power high and drunk
1561970868061933,40:46,Derek Main,@cassim suleman And now we have systematic oppression of whites. How is that right?
1561970899105248,41:19,Robert Russell,@Born free ..... Namibia recently kicked BEE to touch because it was not working and was deemed to be a racist practice
1561970900267083,41:20,Musa Mabunda,"@Derek, so how should we redress the imbalances of the past?"
1561970905680328,41:25,cassim suleman,no not revenge..but have to address the injustices of apartheid..cant do nothing and ignore how the black nation was destroyed.
1561970966903795,42:26,Derek Main,@Musa Mabunda I think we would have been a lot further along that road if the cadres didn't steal all the money. Whites are being made scapegoat's for the ANC failures.
1561970984613308,42:43,Mqondisi Maphophe,Anyone that disrupts the previlege of minority is Corrupt thats the narrative and thats what we shouldnt be fighting if we had the land
1561971001286312,43:00,Francel van Eeden,Musa my point of view is not to take revenge that is self destructive this is what is currently happening what the previous goverment did is now practiced by current government
1561971003054248,43:02,Derek Main,@cassim suleman Like I said Apartheid ver 2.0
1561971008344411,43:07,cassim suleman,what is happening from black population is as a result of ANC not addressing the imbalance properly..they looted insteaf
1561971075929248,44:15,Born free,BEE Is a Racist nonsensical system. It has destroyed all African countries. This is not practised in Botswana.. a merit system works.
1561971076091755,44:16,cassim suleman,ya unfortunately we minority is getting the backlash of poor ANC
1561971079688742,44:19,Musa Mabunda,@Francel van Eeden is it necessary to redress the past imbalances?
1561971079851098,44:19,Derek Main,@cassim suleman Are you excusing their criminality?
1561971109529444,44:48,Derek Main,@Musa Mabunda By perpetuating apartheid???
1561971120288844,44:59,Margareth Waterboer,"@Cassim Suleman, unfortunately BEE has become a vehicle for only a few to get rich and corruption is thriving under it through the excuse of BEE.. This commission has exposed that. The best pushed out"
1561971126143652,45:05,cassim suleman,no ways..but cause and action..is where we are..
1561971146169004,45:26,Francel van Eeden,Musa I do agree with you there 200% no question but how we adress it is the question
1561971183434689,46:03,Raymond Fitzgerald,gees this goes soo to the ground I hope they can rubbish out from management to the floor workers
1561971187449054,46:06,Musa Mabunda,@Francel van Eeden okay what would you suggest?
1561971210150407,46:29,Born free,Borrowed Money and taxpayers money has been STOLEN
1561971217674597,46:36,cassim suleman,the ANC did not embrace minorities into the structures..we have become isolated and marginalised..
1561971230483629,46:49,Musa Mabunda,"@Derek Main how can we go about it then, in your view?"
1561971242258109,47:01,mahfuz8599114,morning twane
1561971245674510,47:05,Raymond Fitzgerald,no Miss Hofmeyer today this lady does not inspire any confidence that is why Chair has to get involved
1561971260989457,47:20,Francel van Eeden,Instead of focusing on the current and previous injustices as our goal post lets stand together and build a future
1561971262124112,47:21,Born free,We will fight the ANC in a Constitutional Court.
1561971271768001,47:30,Yolo More,Am I the only one who is fed up by these hackers that keep on poping
1561971297948823,47:58,cassim suleman,tough to solve now..body is rotten.and worse to follow..

1561971334946020,48:34,Derek Main,What we have now is unfair discrimination based on race. Isn't that what apartheid was?
1561971335003359,48:34,cassim suleman,true
1561971351789832,48:51,cassim suleman,yip
