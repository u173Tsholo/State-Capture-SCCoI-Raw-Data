1556873247728932,46:15,Nelson Musoliwa,Work a man on his mind(indoctrination) then you will control him for a long time than enticing him with material things which may be lacking at times.
1556873310303982,47:18,Born free,Yes Nelson that is Malemas agenda with the poor and unemployed.
1556873408909563,48:56,Magda Seguin,"Remember Zuma was intelligence head in exile,according to Ramathlodi's testimony he ordered execution of many people in exile...he is a feared man among ANC cadres hence his power to control"

1556873501108517,50:28,Wildthing,he also ordered the killing of ANC members that started an uprising in Mozambique. what a great leader.
1556873529484028,50:57,Magda Seguin,Political killings in SA is not widely reported and it goes on unabated
1556873580572946,51:48,Magda Seguin,It is easy to understand why Malema said he will kill for Zuma
1556873785974189,55:13,Born free,"Why do you think Malema said ""I will kill to put Zuma in power""?because Zuma is not an intelligent man and was corruptable and of course Malema had an Agenda."
1556873790254664,55:17,Magda Seguin,Zuma had so much more that he exonerated Jiba's husband and employed her a DD of the NPA knowing full well she was never admitted to the Bar as an attorney
1556873892915290,57:00,Magda Seguin,I can full well understand that CR was not included in the Zuma faction while he was deputy president...everything happened underground
1556873944277897,57:52,Nelson Musoliwa,Power next to the state coffers(money) is not as healthy as we would like it to be. Is this without regard to race?
1556873979713291,58:27,Born free,Hi Nelson the poor people are not going to listen to my warnings but they may listen to yours.
1556874132307526,1:01:00,Born free,Malemas agenda is not only to capture all government entities but to capture private business entities and loot the lot.
