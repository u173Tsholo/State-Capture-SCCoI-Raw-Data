1567171934069728,1:33:26,Pastor J.J,@Derek Main Your statement makes a lot of sense. However they got it very wrong in NMB
1567171967204399,1:33:58,Derek Main,@Cerebis I agree with you. Not sure what other factors are at play there but Bobani is very suspect.
1567171971994755,1:34:02,Eugene,Apartheid. lawd like affirmative action and black economic empowerment is clear signs of apartheid.
