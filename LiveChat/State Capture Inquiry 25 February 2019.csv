1551082592449399,1:12:06,Coco,@ Makhosi he was protected by the whole ANC cocus including the present president so what does that tell you
1551082623107689,1:12:36,Dieter Myburgh,i think all ministers and deputies must be fired and new ones must be appointed.
1551082627491062,1:12:40,Emma Gcee,our major problems in Africa are our youth who refused to do the right thing
1551082651660497,1:13:04,Paul Mufhadi,Giving ANC the chance is suicide.

1551089699899362,3:10:32,Magda Seguin,*decline
1551089700972171,3:10:33,Mzalwane Mzala,The establishment of this Special Tribunal is occasioned by the need to fast-track the finalisation of matters that the SIU refers for civil litigation following conclusion of their investigations.
1551089701437821,3:10:33,Talloolah Moon,Mzalwane?
1551089703373993,3:10:36,Joel Mzayidume,true @Makwa Choma
1551089717277003,3:10:50,Mzalwane Mzala,These are matters where the SIU would have referred to civil litigation contracts entered into by state institutions to be declared irregularly invalid or set aside.
1551089744755857,3:11:17,Magda Seguin,@Mzalwane Mzala Yes
1551089758836603,3:11:32,James Godloza Godloza,"my friends if at any point I have the right call or assume that those we have the interactions with via this channel are my friend's, I would like to use this opportunity to share with you my friends"

1551089817823870,3:12:30,Makwa Choma,They bankrupted the whole
1551089841489450,3:12:54,Mzalwane Mzala,Fast-tracking these matters will enable the SIU to recover monies and or assets lost by state institutions through irregular and corrupt means.
1551089870729208,3:13:24,Talloolah Moon,But after lengthy court cases?
1551089872015134,3:13:25,Mzalwane Mzala,"It will, thus be ensuring that those who are responsible for the loss of monies and or assets by state institutions are held accountable."
1551089890912379,3:13:43,Makwa Choma,They bankrupted the country sudden we must trust them again
1551089892874164,3:13:45,Mzalwane Mzala,The Special tribunal
1551089919577805,3:14:13,Talloolah Moon,Ok. So it should be less lengthy

1551090154475047,3:18:07,Mzalwane Mzala,The powers and functions of the Special Tribunal are to adjudicate upon any civil proceedings brought before it by a (SIU) in its own emanating from the investigation by such SIU.
