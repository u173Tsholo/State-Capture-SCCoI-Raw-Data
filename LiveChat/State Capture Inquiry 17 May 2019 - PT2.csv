1558097259051170,46:13,Marvel Ramatshela,"I thought educated folks are not easy to be bought, I guess I was wrong"
1558097287793248,46:42,Derek Main,@Marvel Ramatshela Yes - everybody knew except the ANC - or so they say.

1558097509476386,50:24,Marvel Ramatshela,As I wait to see them go to jail. The only ANC chaps who went to prison for corruption is Convict Tony Yengeni and late Mr J Selebi out of 1000s we know
1558097624340412,52:19,Derek Main,We need to start building more prisons for all the ANC criminals.

1558097997287223,58:32,Derek Main,@Felix Muyoba I disagree - I know many poor people who are fine upstanding citizens. That's a lame excuse for the ANC.

1558098072831746,59:47,Derek Main,No problem - I do agree that inequality is something that has to be dealt with. The wage gap is obscene.
1558098178684288,1:01:33,Felix Muyoba,i agree with you @Derek Main..some people still commit criminality though they have plenty..it is just greed..
