1542012016534490,38:17,Mr Q,true
1542012026573016,38:27,Mr Q,He is so ungrateful
1542012049588914,38:51,Desmond Masilela,I thought when Cyrial Ramaphosa took over he would clean up all these rotten cabinet of Zuma and appoint his own cabinet. He still working with all that rotten cabinet.
1542012106578645,39:48,Mr Q,Cyril is inteligent. after elections he will remove all that rot

1542012135658137,40:16,hassiem fisher,its not easy to remove someone from his position unless due process have been followed.
1542012139357707,40:20,peter pott,"masilela! he was the deputy president in this ""rotten cabinet"". meaning he must excuse himself too following your reasoning"
1542012140550511,40:22,Mr Q,also reduce cabinet size.. its intelligence in politics
1542012147037190,40:28,Desmond Masilela,@Mr Q. lets hope so.

1542012342291357,43:43,Mashilo Kotelo,Hope for meaningful testimony Hogan.
1542012522240421,46:43,peter pott,Here is just one question: was the lives of black people improved during the turn of Barbara Hogan as a public enterprise minister? yes/no
1542012561692284,47:23,Lin Chia-Hsien,black out ~
1542012569931916,47:31,Mr Q,Yes.. SAA was making profits back then
1542012597415040,47:58,K,😂😂😂
1542012603681279,48:05,peter pott,Mr Q. which year? back then cannot be the answer
1542012613724276,48:15,Mr Q,"Today, we are bailing SAA out every now n then"
1542012620507647,48:21,Tumelo Manamela,😂😂😂😂😂
1542012721118818,50:02,General Mtungwa,Mr Q which year was SAA making profits and how much profit did it make . Please support your statement....
1542012727535198,50:08,Sthakathi Khumalo,Maria Ramos white capturer of note
1542012769092994,50:50,Tlhogi Dube,"@peter pott 2011 was the last time SAA made an operating profit, she was fired in late 2010. So the financial year and her term coincide. The changes made by her successor led to the misbehaviour."
1542012847135648,52:08,peter pott,"Dude. that was not profit. We sold our fleet, Andrew Coleman did that, and then we are paying a rented fee"
1542012872243022,52:33,david dawood,I sense trouble in this commission today😞
1542012891746028,52:53,Dimakatso Tshinaba,morningsssss. just got here
1542012939839972,53:41,Kevin Davis,whatever Hogan says the zuma people will say nothing implicates him.trust me
1542012940587416,53:42,Pule Monnamoncho,So
1542012942923531,53:44,Pule Monnamoncho,?
1542012948545956,53:49,Tlhogi Dube,"@peter post go check your facts Coleman was part of SAA in 2001, 2001 chief"
1542013038895430,55:20,peter pott,"Dube. Here she is out of her own mouth, saying SAA during her turn was about to be declared bankrupt, hence government brought guarantees."
1542013040413796,55:21,Sabelo Devaldo Nkwinika,kubi
1542013097548688,56:18,Tlhogi Dube,@peter pott do you understand the concept of going concern?
1542013131998997,56:53,peter pott,Dube. don't attempt to be her spokesperson. this are comrades fighting their own personal battles in the public gallery. How Zuma treated kathrada is on the table here
1542013234322979,58:35,Tlhogi Dube,@peter pott Im not her spokesperson you choosing to quote lies for no reason Andrew coleman chief!!! Dudu Myeni tried to throw around that lie
1542013255742636,58:56,Tlhogi Dube,@Thando Nkuta chief google the financial statements dude
1542013304809816,59:46,peter pott,sadly is that we don't own majority of the planes we see at our airports. We are leasing them. for how much ?
1542013386477963,1:01:07,Pink Panther Panther,She was not allowed to share a cell with blacks.
1542013415289603,1:01:37,Tlhogi Dube,@peter post its not sad the business model of airlines now requires them to lease aircraft. That way they able to use the best aircraft every 2-3 years without sinking millions.
1542013418924040,1:01:40,mlungisi khumalo,the question is why
1542013426501011,1:01:48,Pink Panther Panther,the apartheid regime did not want her to mix with blacks
1542013458495946,1:02:19,Paul Amoomo,"Hence called ""Apartheid"""
1542013462954660,1:02:24,mlungisi khumalo,being white does not mean you are better but its just a skin colour
1542013465618687,1:02:27,peter pott,dube. You got to be kidding me. model of airlines?really
1542013529366738,1:03:30,Tlhogi Dube,@peter post you can challenge the cost of the leases and whether they are favourable to SAA. But the concept of leasing is standard in the industry.
1542013574207035,1:04:15,mlungisi khumalo,why white privilege in a country with black majority
1542013595285755,1:04:36,peter pott,Michael katz name comes so often in this discussion.lol
1542013643579516,1:05:25,Tlhogi Dube,@peter pott Boeing releases new aircraft every 5 years imagine having to spend R10billion every 5 years to buy aircraft it makes no business sense when you can reduce the risk.
1542013689809201,1:06:11,Tlhogi Dube,Lease = right of use chief owning something out right doesn't always make perfect business sense
1542013694317796,1:06:15,Huddy Makhaza,true that @Thando
1542013724870270,1:06:46,peter pott,"Dube. Now long ago SAA was in parliament. They confirm that they are paying R283m pm, yes pm. for the lease. who in the world can make profit by bleeding so much every month?"
1542013725571517,1:06:46,Mpho Kgomo,"Yes Mlungisi I would like to find out why, this is bigger than the black players implicated."
1542013753398760,1:07:14,Robert Russell,@Thando Nkutha ......The white apartheid government put a fellow white person in solitary confinement for 7 years and you call that a WHITE PRIVLAGE??????
1542013868686166,1:09:09,mlungisi khumalo,yes Mpho it seems even we black people we are too submissive to the whites whilst we are in our own land
1542013879518501,1:09:20,NKANYISO BRANDON DUBE,This enquiry sounds like a lecture.
1542013908099868,1:09:49,peter pott,The is where out problem is. someone accept a role as a minister. And she goes to outsiders to help her understand her job.
1542014152306596,1:13:53,Tlhogi Dube,"@peter pott SAA collapsed because of bad management (especially cost) , unprofitable routes, and increasing finance costs ."
1542014249371458,1:15:30,peter pott,well done Judge Zondo
1542014301030582,1:16:22,Nelson Musoliwa,Ministers entitled to seek professional advises in administrative justice or legislative imperatives

1542015402534559,1:32:43,Siphiwe Ntshali,She looks very aggressive this lady.
1542015426674263,1:33:07,NKANYISO BRANDON DUBE,Can someone educate me please. Did SOEs made profit prior to 1994? If yes how was the model and why was it changed?

1542015673981271,1:37:14,Mpho Kgomo,"Frans do not go there, what must we do?"
1542015765646686,1:38:46,Mpho Kgomo,"Tladi and Marc count me in, and that fact that its already gone pear shaped deliberately is frustrating."
1542015814673983,1:39:35,Mpho Kgomo,But Thando nothing ever translates into True JUSTICE.

1542018645508581,2:26:46,Marc McDonald,"@Michael Mpagi it all goes back to the SARB , who owns it ... the SARB owners control the money and so, control the country"
1542018665256264,2:27:05,Trucker Trucker,"Michael Mpagi, this country has never been ran by black people. Ramaphosa wrote this constitution with his white friends to ensure that their interests were protected."
1542018718023660,2:27:58,Takalani Luthada,people who were elected by 2007 in polokwane are all who led the countto these mess and Malema now he makes a lot of noise about them whereas he campaigned for them and bet with his life
1542018718938557,2:27:59,Trucker Trucker,Go and read about Brian Menell and his links to Patrice Motsepe. He and Ramaphosa are BEE billionnaires.
