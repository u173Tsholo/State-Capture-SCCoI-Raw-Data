1604309514734717,1:23:36,a b c,@Khani I think it would have been more accurate to have perhaps said corrupt individuals period... rather than also mention their race... I think it would've avoided the issue...

1604309576676696,1:24:37,Mahendra Dabideen,Not 1 race can say they are free of corruption. You get bad apples in all races so lets not paint all people with the same corrupt brush
1604309596234693,1:24:59,a b c,"Because by saying ""black people"" it implies a number of things like it's exclusive only to blacks or that the skin colour plays a part in the corruption"
