1603178279181173,-44:54,Damon Radebe,"irregularities on any operations, but yes there are those who are corrupt like the current sitting president of a country somewhere in Southern Africa..."
1603178371744081,-43:22,Damon Radebe,"but going on a reviewing all operations of government is wrong and unlawful, this would never happen anywhere else in the world except South Africa"
1603178405703200,-42:48,Heather Durr,@Damon Radebe I am a staunch anti-Trumper and GOP hater but the democrats have their fair share of dark secrets. Politics is all about money and lies and secret undercover ops

1603182559155280,26:13,Blake Yogi,blocked the chicken guy
1603182561078304,26:15,TheQueen V,@Big Daddy I can explain but I doubt you have the capacity to indulge such info.
1603182561188003,26:16,Aubrey De Bliquy,"Then we need more electricity, not more railway freight. It is not as if the manganese is nt going to be refine at destination."

1603182608520565,27:03,SanFran Arnold,@Aubrey De Bliquy you do understand that smelters can not just go and switch back on when the lights go back on? They have to build a new furnace overtime that happens
1603182609873868,27:04,Lebohang Mofokeng,supplier development
1603182622756987,27:17,Aubrey De Bliquy,That is circular logic @SanFran Arnold

1603182685235541,28:19,Aubrey De Bliquy,@SanFran Arnold Circular logic again. The same applies to a host of industrry. You argue as if smelting is the only industry that cannot deal with load shedding.
1603182697178313,28:32,SanFran Arnold,"I am not asking you this, I know that most of the smelters have left. Please facts first"

1603182923305042,32:19,Aubrey De Bliquy,@SanFran Arnold All that may be true without it detracting from my point. The manganese is going to ultimately be smelted. Avoiding solving the problem does not detract from my point.

1603182994292112,33:30,SanFran Arnold,@Aubrey De Bliquy your point makes it impossible for smelters to survive in SA. You would need to first sort out power before smelting can be done
1603182995093747,33:30,Blake Yogi,"Number 1 is so smart. The only evidence against him is talk from witnesses, who are also dodgy/full of lies"

1603183084908808,35:00,Pastor J.J,@Val Speirs Yes he is. I also thought the same of Eugene Terrablanche who behaved no better than Julius. In public hated blacks but was ok to have sexual relationships with black boys. What a disgrace
1603183085730819,35:00,Shumi Ngwenya,"@Mfanafuthi Gama, your being number 100 means nothing, or being number 1000, etc. You would be too low to matter. But being number 1 or 2 does. Nobody else can be higher than those high numbers."

1603189255592434,2:17:49,a b c,The reality is that people are so estranged to farms and farm-folk that they don't care if farmers are being killed... that's a problem because they will likely continue if people aren't concerned...
1603189262440596,2:17:57,Tommygun,@Singi Mathebula As long as we have no education or hope or maybe less single mothers
1603189278861057,2:18:12,Sanele Dlamini,Killing of human beings in SA is not limited to farmers. SA has a crime problem.

1603189867139095,2:28:01,Fred Desrosiers,Big mistake to ask Mr. Ready to talk to Sighn. It is like asking the wolf for candy.
1603189874113797,2:28:08,Zinhle Big Daddy Dee,@ Brain Hayes then we are all mad because Juju is doing the work on TV now he is the most popular thing we hear and see because he is speaking of real matters

1603189883525320,2:28:17,Cerebis,@Lona Devu Malema does speak a lot of crap. He goes to a court case about alleged farm murderers and announces that there are no farm murders in SA. Has he and the President have the same view?

1603189958492540,2:29:31,MIKE DURBAN,This is my take.......the Commie ANC are so desperate because of the state capture etc etc......reckon they would do anything ...maybe even ga so far as to start a civil war etc....watch this space..
1603189963429870,2:29:39,Annie Van Niekerk,Big Daddy Dee I don’t do malema and if you advocate for a fool like him we will never sit at the same table.
