1557913102911095,1:17:10,Dilip Badal,A Point to ponder...... retirement funds amounts to something like 2 trillion rands in the kitty..invested locally... Watch The ANC amend the constitution to attach that... Run folks .dont walk. Run

1557913465838091,1:23:14,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Derek main ANC is the party for all people, no one should undermine the will of voters, we are remorseful we did mistakes before we are humble to rectify those mistakes"
1557913467533013,1:23:16,Derek Main,@Granny Mokwena Ask the ANC - they will have some spin or other.
1557913532211235,1:24:20,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Not possible for the ANC - they're corrupt to the core. Remember my words a year down the line when we have slipped even further under the thieves.
1557913653557894,1:26:22,Felix Muyoba,a business case cannot be a one man show..
1557913709286234,1:27:18,makhosi nobhatyi,"@Derek main as president said change is painful and hard to accept, it may take time but we will engage each other in a persuasion way to others to join the boat"
1557913719996695,1:27:28,Felix Muyoba,@Granny Mokwena meaning R271m went to waste?
1557913720415598,1:27:28,Robert Russell,The ANC will keep this commission going for 5 years so that Jelly Fish Ramafaker does not have to act on his comrats
1557913744248829,1:27:52,Derek Main,@Felix Muyoba Exactly - yet the voters still cling to the fantasy that one man can turn everything around. Even though he was silent as DP when all this corruption continue.
1557913746758361,1:27:55,MAKOTOKO,inquiries in South Africa is just waist of time. since time is money
1557913755670652,1:28:03,Felix Muyoba,@Robert Russell that is so true
1557913836514504,1:29:24,Lew464,"Dilip Badal , you raise a valid point. There is just too much in that kitty. I'm equally concerned about the fate of the fund. Will that be the next subject of a commission?"
1557913880897531,1:30:09,Robert Russell,Wait till we see who is on the list for parliament.... none of the crooks from the Zuma/Ace faction will be removed... just wait....and see
1557913934139805,1:31:02,Felix Muyoba,the business case was overstated to justify the looting
1557914004161390,1:32:12,makhosi nobhatyi,Look guys here what ever comes out here is binding i was listening to Ace Magashule saying saying commission findings are not binding which he shows they may defiance to show up to the commission
1557914119403501,1:34:07,Robert Russell,The reason I say that is that CR only acts when a commission/inquiry makes a recommendation.... even the ANC ethics team are disregarded shows how deep the crooks are in-bedded in the ANC
1557914124087959,1:34:13,makhosi nobhatyi,"NPA, hawks are following these procedures whatever they found here they investigate it further, just give President time he will act rational"
1557914274154428,1:36:41,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi We expect no different from the ANC.
1557914299592990,1:37:08,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Felix Muyoba I am serious about this, President study this long time, he will apply laws simple, once something comes out testifying or not once you have implicated NPA should come in arrest you,"

1557915189532926,1:51:58,makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Roberts Russell no he said publicly no one must be on the cabinet implicated, I think he may keep Gwede Mantashe, coz nothing much which implicates him, he will go again to testify."

1557916249285530,2:09:37,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Gwede Mantashe got security installed by Bosasa - how is he not implicated? Or is that just ANC spin?
1557916254809776,2:09:42,Mike Moja,@Felix Muyoba very eloquent. he knows his story
1557916336319205,2:11:04,0,guess where the meeting was?
1557916679522686,2:16:47,Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Your own integrity committee fingered Mantashe but we all know the ANC will ignore them.

1557916946555839,2:21:15,Robert Russell,Exactly @Derek Main.... if I was a crook.... I would want to be part of team ANC.... for sure
1557916978014212,2:21:46,Magda Seguin,So many people believed the EFF when they attacked Gordhan when he started cleaning up at PRASA.Since the testimonies started of what really happened they are quiet.

1557917235930360,2:26:04,Magda Seguin,Manoj will not testify unless he is subpoenaed
1557917332687961,2:27:40,Magda Seguin,The list of those who benefited from Dubai flights and Oberoi hotel stays was published yesterday...Koko is one of them...he is still very vocal on Twitter as if he is innocent
