1559116496514042,37:16,Epnet Streaming,Fully understand SABC sound is always the biggest problem. You would think it video but no it is always sound - sorry for you. Regards Gordon
1559117463512512,53:22,Derek Main,@Lucky123 Thwala Sounds like something from Nkandla
1559117758088050,58:18,Dan Brown,SABC use an Ocean Feed then.
1559118579731471,1:11:59,Allan Xu,this State capture inquiry will be going on forever
1559118782472004,1:15:22,Tony Better SA,I have faith in Deputy Chief Justice Zondo - He will get them all. Then NPA will put them in orange suits for many years
1559118868074725,1:16:47,Nkululeko Malandela,is everything going ryt
1559119184662625,1:22:03,Tony Better SA,Only ONE problem. If ANC get rid of Pres Cyril we are all doomed.
1559119231426216,1:22:50,Granny Mokwena,may we see corrupt politicians go to jail in our lifetime.
1559119284300096,1:23:43,Khaya Nomoyi,They were actually treating Transnet like their own piggy bank.
1559119301712236,1:24:01,Thembisa Odendaal,Anyone who wears a bow tie for this kind of gathering is beyond vain...so embarrassing they can't even act serious...even serial killers dress appropriately
1559119352975294,1:24:52,Peet Venter,Haibo Thembisa!
1559119477839066,1:26:57,Nelson Musoliwa,If Brian molefe is counted among the so called Black excellence then it will need re defining
1559119501504578,1:27:20,Lawrence Logie,"i can""t wait to see what will happen, after spending millions and time for state capture"
1559119528078046,1:27:47,Noluthando Masondo,"Thembisa Ondendaal, fortunately enough i know Mr Sedumedi, he prefers a bow tie more than a normal tie. Check MNS Attorneys profile, he always wears a bow tie."
1559119772061499,1:31:51,Granny Mokwena,I love his accent to bitsüíû
1559119817620507,1:32:36,Thembisa Odendaal,Sorry guys this is making me physically ill to see this incompetence

1559120002819629,1:35:41,Briony French,Whats with the ticking on the sound?
1559120018496571,1:35:58,phemelo tshukudu,"Lol Thembisa as for bow tie, he looks scared and not comfortable with his own statement seems like this was written for him and he is only here for presentation."
1559120040890432,1:36:20,Lucky123 Thwala,terrible sound
1559120041309793,1:36:20,Briony French,Where is the warrant for Brian Molefe's arrest? Where are these State Capture Policemen?
1559120065970374,1:36:45,Nelson Musoliwa,Still remember how Ben Ngubane was so furious about former PP Thuli report on state capture the day Brian Molefe cried in public saying the PP will be responsible if Eskom looses Molefe.
1559120099100483,1:37:18,Briony French,SABC this poor quality is why no one will pay you.
