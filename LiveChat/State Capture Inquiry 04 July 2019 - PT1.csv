1562228229553132,16:17,Aniceth De Missamou,The guy is responding in English. It's a ploy for avoid stating much. They are soldiers and work for the Gov not in a Base so how do they run the Gov business with foreigners dignitaries?
1562228260540214,16:48,Phillip Cwazibe,@Makosi Nobhatyi Ambassador yonke.

1562228370087444,18:37,Aniceth De Missamou,"So he can read email and respond to them with foreigners dignitaries but can't express himself in English at an enquiry? These soldiers, wow."
1562228382782855,18:51,Norman Zwane,"@Sinethemba Sakuba The language of office work is usually easy to deal with over time but for most people court language remains foreign. Unless you are exceptionally fluent, it helps to translate"

1562228454628623,20:02,Aniceth De Missamou,"These are soldiers and everything to them is ""War"" and all tactics are permissible to win"
1562228457834730,20:05,Robert Russell,It's the new game plan.... use interpreters so that when Zuma appears on the 15th.... they will run out of time before the 19th because of this tactic and he will not answer all the questions
1562228462850908,20:10,Thami Ngwenya,Ke tsotsi ye just by looking
1562228470456902,20:18,Phillip Cwazibe,@ Aniceth De Missamou he is much comfortable with English
1562228471113738,20:19,lucas chokoe,Chinese ...and Rassians.....when they adress media they will use their language
1562228480512306,20:28,Norman Zwane,"@Sinethemba Sakuba If you understand English, it buys you extra time to think through your answer before blurting out an answer you may regret. You hear the question twice at least."

1562228532653854,21:20,Phumla Setlhoke,Lamatoliki are doing it purposely.This is the introduction preparing for Mr Zuma not to look foolish during his turn
1562228547470912,21:35,Zola Pinda,they are playing games. they spoke English when allowing the Guptas to land their aircrafts.

1562229211250931,32:39,Norman Zwane,@Aniceth De Missamou The constitutional recognition of our home languages was to ensure that the principle of equality before the law is not slanted to favour the dominant. Just accept it.

1562229217830355,32:45,Molly Dhlamini,Derek Main that is not true

1562229302094918,34:09,Derek Main,@Molly Dhlamini It's been proven over and over again. More of that will come out here at the commission.
1562229370380435,35:18,Molly Dhlamini,Derek Main do you understand the definition of a thief?
1562229400609638,35:48,Derek Main,@Molly Dhlamini I think so - someone who takes what does not belong to them.
1562229454367603,36:42,Robert Russell,I'll answer that for Derek..... it's spelt ANC

1562229506854095,37:34,Bongani Ntuli,Robert Russel come on the judge uses english sir in court what is your urgument ?
1562229519439498,37:47,Norman Zwane,@Deon February I think we dealing with folks who have no idea how frustrating it is to be misunderstood. You get spoken to in a language that is secondary to your instinct to protect yourself.
1562229545848863,38:13,Deon February,My Note Verbal : This will be a loooooong day for the Judge.

1562230822999373,59:30,Dominic Przybylski,I have the privilege of perceiving myself as an individual rather than as a skin colour. I guess that's probably seen as white privilege.

1562231283844228,1:07:12,Norman Zwane,@Sofia Sofia If you are referring to the man on the stand then I think you are off your rocker to be making a judgement of corruption of this man. WHITE PRIVILEGE raises suspicion of Tswana speakers.

1562232736441783,1:31:24,Madelein R,@Glorify Gumede - I think that people who has an important job like he did would be able to speak English. But I also understand that it is a stressful situation and his own language is better fro him
1562232753435760,1:31:42,Cobus Opperman,"Tony stone, Hahaha...."
1562232759720796,1:31:47,Glorify Gumede,@Derek Main I don't know but i know that you know
1562232820245970,1:32:48,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Madelein Huxtable This is just a tactic , perhaps advice from lawyers..... to just irritate, distract."
1562232836882419,1:33:05,Derek Main,@Glorify Gumede No - I don't know. They may be protesting but I think it's more that they feel better able to answer in their own mother tongue.
1562232843116069,1:33:11,Cobus Opperman,Madelein Huxtable👍
1562232854205292,1:33:22,Norman Zwane,"@Thando Nkutha Yes, the older parts of SOWETO were mixed. I think the Apartheid spatial planners woke up much later by the time they built bo Phiri, Emndeni bo Zola."

1562232889736735,1:33:57,Glorify Gumede,@Derek Main that is the point hence the protest
1562232907313597,1:34:14,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Derek Main Its more of a protest, you're putting it right. Surely having be subpoenaed to testify, lawyers may have came up with this idea."
1562232918007362,1:34:25,Derick Mampuru,when are they returning?
1562232929557262,1:34:37,Nyasimi Geoffrey,Morning by brothers and sisters from south africa just logge in who is the witness today
1562232933381973,1:34:41,Dominic Przybylski,@makhosi nobhatyi NPA is [hopefully] being repaired but I don't see CR asserting himself in his own party. I suspect that is partly a problem of its philosophy which denies individual leadership.
1562232937221199,1:34:45,Sofia Sofia,So Is Zuma coming on with an interpreter ??
1562232950011823,1:34:57,Nyasimi Geoffrey,no more stupu stupu of yesterday

1562232957536898,1:35:05,Glorify Gumede,@Madelein Huxtable they not only able to speak english but they are expose to a fast pace environment
1562232985997720,1:35:33,Derek Main,@Glorify Gumede @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU That's a serious accusation - you are saying that they are obstructing justice.
1562232987761338,1:35:35,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Nyasimi Geoffrey It just finish!! yOU're late!! LOL

1562233094574376,1:37:22,Hester Ferrezuelo,Every word is recorded - so you expect one person to be able to type in all 12 languages? Does that make sense?
1562233119362337,1:37:47,Dominic Przybylski,"@Norman Zwane I think it is just for practical reasons, so that all record of the commission is in a single language, needed for efficiency."
1562233128780604,1:37:56,Derek Main,"@Norman Zwane I think you are correct. As far as I know, legal processes have to be conducted in English but anyone testifying can chose to do so in their own language with an interpreter."
1562233171461161,1:38:39,Norman Zwane,"@Dominic Przybylski Makes sense, thanks mate. Is there a law to that ?"
1562233207522223,1:39:15,Glorify Gumede,The question is why should other people be accommodated and who's responsibility it is to do it? in other words should one compromise their own life just to accommodate others? individual freedom
1562233219629581,1:39:27,KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Derek Main You just putting words in my mouth now.... ""obstructing justice""? Never said that. Perhaps, the plan was to lesson chances of falling into trap? We don't know...we all just speculating"

1562233338717868,1:41:27,Glorify Gumede,@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU your speculation about being trapped in not far from the truth. We make mistakes all the time and it's our people who are first to laugh so why blame these guys?
1562233348795796,1:41:37,Thembelani,Molweni... what have i missed ?
1562233353634005,1:41:41,Derek Main,@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Yes - of course - pure speculation.
1562233410928309,1:42:38,Dominic Przybylski,We need to understand that in 4th Industrial Revolution technology is the leading edge and most of it is specified in English. There isn't enough time to 'waste' it translating into other languages.
1562233433154455,1:43:01,Dominic Przybylski,The world is moving too fast for that.
1562233470236719,1:43:39,FIKILE DANIEL Nomandla,Didn’t miss much- people in here are more concerned about color
1562233557809089,1:45:05,Thembelani,"@thando, how's it ? care to bring me up to speed"
1562233590067358,1:45:37,Norman Zwane,"@Jean-Pierre Le Roux I'm arguing about language, my argument is not that lastic that you can stretch it to property. You wanna talk WHITE PRIVILEGE on property just send the invite."

1562233884305843,1:50:32,Dominic Przybylski,@Norman Zwane Yes apartheid gave whites privilege with regard to land ownership and that privilege has been inherited by current generation. Should any form of inheritence be allowed?
1562233966011507,1:51:54,Dominic Przybylski,Can inheritence be disallowed retrospectively? What are the limits?
1562234046687417,1:53:14,Norman Zwane,"@Dominic Przybylski Inheritence is a natural phenomenon so I'd be reluctant to go there at all.I think our problem precedes the inheritence, it may well be located in the nature of acquisition of such"
