: Good morning Ms Gcabashe, good morning everybody. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good morning DCJ.  DCJ this morning we are asking that the witness who we were going to be called does not appear today.  We probably need two days in any event for that evidence.  We ask that you please consider postponing the hearing of that evidence to the 20 t h and the 21 s t of September.  It is a Friday and a Saturday Chairman.  We have checked with our colleagues who may be representing her and they are comfortable with the dates; they have agreed to those dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  I am fully aware of the reasons for the request for the adjournment of the hearing of this witness’ evidence.  I am therefore happy to adjourn the hearing of the evidence to Friday the t h and Saturday the 21 s t September 2019 at ten o’clock on each days unless later on I direct that we start earlier than ten o’clock.  So the – we will therefore adjourn today’s proceedings but tomorrow we will proceed as planned for this week.  Tomorrow as I understand we are supposed to hear the evidence from the former Head of the Department of Agriculture. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Mr Thabethe and we will run that hearing hopefully for the two days, Thursday and Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If we start at ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So tomorrow we should hear evidence from Mr Thabethe.  We will then adjourn for today and tomorrow we will start at ten o’clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 15 AUGUST 2019
